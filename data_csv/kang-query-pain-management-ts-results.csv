Oh My!,"The last 10 days have been a nightmare.  Dad (85 years old with moderate dementia) fell and split his head open.  He was rushed to the ER.  We were there for 8 hours or so.  That's when we got the horrible news that Dad has brain cancer.  I had so many decisions to make so quickly.  I decided no brain surgery no radiation and no chemo.  I took Dad home and hired 24-hour home health workers.   I made the decision to focus only on comfort care and pain management.  The next day we started hospice.  Yesterday and today the pain was so intense we started him on morphine.    Ten days ago Dad was walking unaided.  Now he uses a walker and still needs a person to help.  He can only walk a few steps with the walker.  He has no sense of balance.  The doctor says he will not recover his balance.  Ten days ago Dad was living fairly independently in a retirement community with me going by for 3-4 hours a day.  Now he needs 24-hour nurses there and still needs me for most of the day.  Ten days ago Dad was on no pain medication.  Now he's taking morphine frequently.    Ten days ago Dad could get in and out of a chair unaided.  Now he needs a lift chair and an aid to help him.    I've tried to stay strong -- for him.  In reality I'm exhausted and overwhelmed.  I've had to miss a lot of work and my job is in jeopardy.  I'm single so I rely on my job -- it's the only income I have.  When Dad was hospitalized I called my brother to tell him what happened.  He lives 12 hours away.  When we started hospice I called him again.  He said over and over how glad he was that Dad had me and that he agreed with all my decisions.  I called him Friday night and he didn't take my call.  He never called me back.  I saw him online and said ""Hello"" but he never responded.  I saw him online several more times but he never messaged me.  I didn't think much about it.  Today while I was at Dad's I picked up Dad's phone and called my brother. I wanted to tell him we had started Dad on morphine.   He answered immediately.  I asked him about his family -- just some quick small talk.  I didn't mention the earlier phone call or online message.  He said I know  you called Friday but I was at a party and it wasn't convenient to take your call.  I said That's no problem.  He said I know you messaged me but I've been very busy. (He takes a vacation almost every month.)   Again I said No problem.  He then said his life is very busy right now and he just can't deal ""with this"" right now.  He said he knew Dad was in good hands with me to do whatever I think is best and that he'd call me ""sometime.""  Then he hung up.  I know I won't hear from him again until I have to call him to tell him that Dad passed.  He did this 10 years ago when I did hospice with my mother who had cancer.  I took a 3 month leave of absence from work and moved down to my mom's house -- did 24 hour care myself because I promised her she could die at home.  Mom was calling for him but he wouldn't come to visit.  He said he couldn't handle seeing her ""like that.""  He did show up for the funeral.  I know I shouldn't have expected his help but somehow I still did.  Now I'm feeling very alone and overwhelmed.  I have absolutely no one to turn to.  I spend almost every waking hour with Dad but when I come home to sleep I get woken up by calls from the caregivers and call-backs from the emergency hospice nurse. I know with time we will get his pain under control but until then I'm a walking zombie.      I considered putting Dad in skilled nursing but they said with his dementia and uncontrolled pain he'd still need 24 hour personal aides in addition to the skilled nursing.  He's not eligible for medicaid yet.    I feel like I'm running out of options I'm definitely running out of money.  Mostly I'm running out of energy.  Thanks for listening to me vent.  I'm feeling a bit hopeless right now.",False,RainStorm,2016-07-06,29.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547310,,,AlzConnected,,,

I had this done my self for a chipped front tooth in the 1980s and the bonding is still good. Then the Dentist a family Dentist for half a century says he simply cannot be her dentist anymore and recommends a Dental Surgeon. I took her there and this Dentist says she has to pull four teeth immediately. I  let her do it . A Surgeon. So as my Mom is coming out of the local; The surgeon comes over a says ""Can you keep her quiet I have other patients"". My mom is 83. Bleeding Four teeth pulled!         Next I take her to a Dentist who advertises his office as Elder friendly with experience in Alzheimers. My sister recommended him.  He looks and says he can't do the work but recommends a Periodondist. This  Gentleman can't do the work because the Anethesiologist needs 8 weeks notice and recommends the University Hospital School of Dentistry Which he tells me has a dozen dentist of different specialist at the hospital Dental Center.  We were put on a two month waiting list. There is in fact only one Dentist in the Special needs clinic and he is about to go on a month long religious Holiday. He wants to pull all her teeth in one day with three visits overall. Next month.        So I found another Dentist after another set of x-rays He recommends 20 root canals at he cost of 84000 dollars -64000 if we pay up front. I agreed to a scaling at 3000 dollars . By now her dental insurance is used up for the year. Periodontal with root canals on top?

I went to see her tonight after work and she was crying in pain. She had a Tramadol at 4PM and it was 6:30PM. It took 20 minutes to calm her down after they moved her from her wheelchair to her bed in the care home. I felt so helpless. I had brought over Alexa and set it up in her room to play her favorite music. Omg I did not expect that. It was the worst I had ever seen my Mom. She is not a complainer ever! I held her hand and let her know it was going to be okay. I even gave her a foot rub anything to try to make her more comfortable to stop crying. Now I'm rethinking the Tremadol and thinking she needs something stronger. Hospice will be paying their visit tomorrow and they will be calling me. The caregivers said 2 of the residents have the Fentanyl Patch that last for 3 days and manages pain. At this point it is all about pain management. I wanted to see if anyone else is experiencing this? I forgot to mention why there is so much pain. In addition to Dementia her breast cancer is spreading all over her body.

5,62103703c9f833c0c92186ca,2147545661,2019-02-10 17:48:00,Pain management issues,I am trying to figure out pain management for my mom and I just have no idea what to do. I apologize - this is going to be kind of a long post…        My mom had lower back spinal fusion surgery around 2007 because she had herniated discs and even had a rupture if I remember correctly. The surgery did not turn out to be very helpful and she had considerable pain and mobility issues after that. She was prescribed a pretty high dosage of narcotic pain medication for it and was on that for a number of years. She eventually tapered back to about 2 pills per day which seemed to be the minimum for her to be able to move during the day and sleep at night. Abuse of the medication was never a problem. I moved her in with me in Florida in 2015 and she was still on narcotics. We quickly discovered that she had to be seen by a pain clinic once per month to be able to continue her prescription. There were times when her pain increased a lot and she was given injections too. I don’t know what her pain tolerance is but she often rated her pain level fairly high.         Her dementia became too severe for home care in mid-2017 and she went into a nursing home nearby. I communicated her medical/surgical history and was able to provide the references for the pain clinic and since the nursing home could give her the meds on schedule she didn’t have to go to the clinic anymore. Then unbeknownst to me the Florida legislature passed a bill in July 2018 that makes it much more difficult for facilities to prescribe narcotics to their patients so she was taken off of her pain medication. I did not know about it until December when during a quarterly care meeting they were naming the medications she is currently on and I just happened to notice that they did not mention her pain medication. I asked about it and it was not on her list. Then someone on staff remembered the new law and said they had essentially had to take everyone there off of narcotics. I spoke to her doctor on the phone and he said that he is not allowed to prescribe more then 3 days worth of narcotics or up to 7 days worth in acute cases or he could lose his medical license. He also kind of lectured me that elderly dementia patients shouldn’t be on it anyway. I said “Well what if they have severe chronic pain and are suffering?” He reiterated that they should not be on it. I found that frustrating because quite honestly at this point it’s more or less palliative care even though my mom isn’t yet at the end of stage. I just want her to be as comfortable as possible. So I asked what else we could do and the only option was a pain consultation at a pain clinic. I said “She can’t answer any questions and she is not going to be able to evaluate her pain on a scale like they ask. How will they evaluate her?” They assured me that they would look for non-verbal cues and things like that. I told them to go ahead and schedule it.         We had the evaluation and the people at the pain clinic clearly had no experience in dealing with someone with severe dementia. They handed me a cup for a urine sample from her and I said “Uh yeah… she is incontinent and is not going to be able to do this.” They said “Oh we’ll just put a plastic catcher on the toilet then.” I said “No you don’t understand. She wears a diaper. She can’t follow directions. She can’t go on demand. I can’t even physically get her on a toilet by myself even if she could. Is there some other way? She cannot provide a urine sample for you.” They said they could do a saliva sample so they did that. Then the physician’s assistant brought us into a room and I explained again that she has pretty severe dementia but also has long term chronic pain and that I wanted to get an evaluation to see if she needs the narcotics or not. He asked her a few questions but she is not really able to communicate - she doesn’t seem to understand what you say to her and her answers are rarely anything coherent. He didn’t really do any evaluation beyond that at all. He just wrote the prescription. Then I asked how often she would need to come back and he said “every 30 days for that to continue.”         Back at the nursing home I expressed that I did not know what to do - she can’t tell me her level of pain or discomfort and I don’t know if she’s doing OK without the narcotics or not. I don’t know if her mental deterioration could make her sensitivity to pain different from what it was before. She can get the medication at the pain clinic but it’s a lot to deal with - the facility has to take 2 staff members drive her across town (because she’s in a wheelchair) I have to take off work and go meet them there and try to speak for her even though I have no idea how she’s feeling because she can’t tell me. She seemed a little freaked out by the drive because she is not in touch with reality and can’t really understand what is going on around her. So I don’t know if it’s worth it to put her through all that every 30 days or if she’s doing OK without the narcotics at this point. It’s also going to be harder on her as she physically deteriorates which is happening fairly quickly.        Neither the social worker or the medical staff seem to know what to tell me and say it’s really up to me. So I’m stuck with deciding whether to traumatize her each month with a drive across town that seemed to freak her out or to discontinue the narcotics and hope she’s not being tortured with pain in addition to everything else she’s suffering (hallucinations loss of cognition loss of physical control). I did ask the social worker to look into whether or not it could fall under “palliative care” and he said he would but we think she would have to under hospice care for that and she’s probably not at that point yet. He’s looking into it.        So I don’t know what to do. Anybody else had any experience with this sort of thing?

She was not alone and got prompt attention.  First experience with a cast luckily her nondominant arm. Pain management - she denies pain but will take Tylenol ""to help the pain stay away.""  Now if I am there she won't do anything for herself.   If I am late arriving in the am  she will do a few things like putting on underwear robe and slippers.  Her cast is a light splint and leaves her elbow free.  She now won't even try to open a house or car door.  She wants to be fed if we are alone!  When we are out in public then she is much better.  I know at stage 5+ she probably should not be alone at night but will not allow anyone to stay over.   And if she knows the hired caregiver will be arriving the next day- she works herself into a weepy state- including going back to bed refusing to get up.     However if she gets angry then she can do all kinds of activities that were normal before the break.  I am concerned about the next 3 or 4 weeks and how to encourage her to do more for herself now.  She allowed herself to collapse into the floor this morning rather than reach for a pillow that fell from her lap.  She walking much more slowly head down even when the splint is off.     Suggestions welcomed.  Thanks much S",False,ImSombody,2018-11-03,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147544458,,,AlzConnected,,,

She also advised that it is possible that the wound will never fully heal due to the circumstances (which I understand).  Hopefully the antibiotic and anti-microbial dressing will take care of the infection but there is no guaranty.  What do I do if nothing works and hospice doesn't have the ability to do any more than what they are doing now?  Has anyone else been in this situation?  Sorry for the long post -- and thank you for any suggestions.",False,Luvsadog2,2017-07-19,31.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536685,,,AlzConnected,,,

They took her off the pain meds until I complained about it and asked if they didn't understand the connection between pain and agitation.... then they put her on Tramadol 50mg 4xper day.  That seemed to help tremendously.  Schedule it give it to her before her pain gets severe and she stays at a low level of pain and is much more easygoing.    They discharge her on this med and give me a script to fill at the local pharmacy.  Go to do that and pharmacist says that it's too much tramadol since she is on seizure meds and tramadol increases seizures. and then tells me two days later that the facility cancelled the script.  1st of all she was given seizure meds 2 years ago by a neurologist who apparently did an EEG and diagnosed her with epilepsy based on an EEG report that said ""abnormal awake drowsy &amp; asleep EEG because of bilaterally present epileptiform discharges.  This recording does may (sic) indicate a lower seizure threshold""  2nd she NEVER had a seizure.  She was put on Keppra 750mg at night.

12,6210530b7b65de9a5b662dc7,2147534466,2017-06-08 12:32:00,Caring for Mom(1),"I'm new to this group.  My mother was ""diagnosed"" 3 or so years ago with AD about a year after the death of my father.  My sister and I pretty much forced her to come to live with one of her 5 children.  2 lived in Phoenix although only one had a home there.  1 lived in LA and my sister lives in Washington and I live in Colorado.  So any place she picked would involve long distance travel for the others.    She picked my brother even though at the time I expressed my disagreement with that.  His wife has bipolar disorder with schizophrenia.  She also has an addictive personality and was imprisoned for 2 years because she took heroin and caused a vehicle accident which resulted in harm to the occupants in the other car as well as herself.  She has had multiple hip replacements and even last year perforated her bowel and was in a coma for a week.  She has neighbors who deal in drugs and come over to the house and she gives them her vicodin and whatever else she has.  If they need toilet paper at 3am they will come over knock on the door and she will give it to them.  This is the house that my mother has been living in for the past 3 years.  And she has been progressively declining in those 3 years.    It all came to a head last week when she called me to ask if she could live with me.  I'm used to my mom saying one thing and the next day having no recollection that she ever said it so I said sure but how about I call you next month and if you still feel this way then for sure you can move up here.  Well an hour or so later my brother calls wanting to know what my mother had called me for.... she had been in the hospital the week prior and apparently the docs there had required that a home health nurse visit the home.  My guess is that my mom had bruises or said something to them to make them suspect abuse or neglect.  According to my brother the nurse had told him that my mother called me.  Ok...well during that conversation my brother related how downhill my mother was going and how abusing she was being to them.  Screaming at them and whatnot.  And that my SIL had researched how to counter that...by having a neighbor call the PD and having her committed for a psych eval.  Well low and behold the very next day he sends a text to us all saying that the exact scenario my SIL had researched had come to be the night before.  So now my mom sits in a very poorly reviewed nursing home undergoing a psych evaluation.  Aside from the sibling issues -- my sisters and I are not speaking.  I *was* on good terms with this brother but after this probably not.  Anyway aside from those issues they have all agreed that our mother should live with me because I have room in my house and I am not working outside the home.  I have the time to give to my mother which my SIL(due to her own health issues) was not able to do.   So that's where we are at right now.  My mother is in phoenix and I'm calling her everyday.  She is furious with my brother and goes on long rants about him and ""that wife of his"" and about how he doesn't love her anymore and wants nothing to do with her.  My sister has arranged a conference call between all of us for this Sunday to discuss my taking over medical POA and moving my mother up here when she is released from the nursing home.  My sister has told me that should be June 17th.  I plan to be down there by that time.  So.... I'm terrified confident happy and sad all at once.  I've wanted my mother to live with me ever since my dad died.  I was her last choice.  So there is that sadness as well to know that I am a last resort.  I'm terrified though that I won't be able to take care of her.  I have a 3 story house with bedrooms on the top and bottom floors so there are stairs involved.  I keep envisioning her falling down the stairs in the middle of the night.  I'm confident though that I can help her far more than my brother could since he was not with her for most of the time being at work.  My SIL never sat with my mom to DO anything just left her to her own devices.  I'm pretty sure that I can do well in that regard.  And being a retired nurse I think I can handle the meds well and doctor visits and maybe get a handle on what's happening.    At the moment all I've gotten is second hand reports from my brother.  I did go to one ""pain management"" doctor visit and was appalled at how they treated my mom.  The doc did not talk to her but to my brother and actually talked about how demented people did this or that... right in front of my mother who look about ready to tear the woman apart.  They tell me that she was the best of who would accept my mother's insurance.  Ack!!!  So my question to all of you is.... is it wrong of me to want to start from square one?  IE have her seen by a neurologist up here and confirm the diagnosis?  From what I can tell she was just told by her doctor in Washington that she had ALZ and that was that...she definitely had it.  No question about what else her cognitive decline might be due to.  So can I start again or is it too late?",False,StarEcho,2017-06-08,159.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534466,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is in a private nursing home in a memory care unit and her behaviors are becoming more combative paranoid and aggressive. Especially when the CNAs bathe or dress her. She is becoming more aggressive towards other residents and can be a feisty pest because she can't verbalize her thoughts and emotions. The staff at the nursing home just held a family meeting with me and my sisters and suggested antipsychotics meds and pain management. We just had an appointment with her Neurologist and he told us about the meds being classified as black box warnings and impose side effects such as stroke dizziness and  Increased risk of falls and fractures.     As a family we decided to try her on a low dose of the meds  they haven't started yet but the more I research these meds the more I feel sick to my stomach and don't know if we are making the right or best choices for her. It's been so heart wrenching watching her rapid decline and we pray she doesn't suffer much longer. But what's the alternatives? Dope her up to keep her calm and risk her suffering a stroke? Which is worse? These are the hardest most stressful choices to make. She has always been such a sweet loving kind soul and even though this disease has taken her mind it hasn't touched her heart.. Even through her rapid decline she still can express love and affection. I love you is one of the only things she can still verbalize clearly. I don't want her to suffer anymore. I want her to be at peace .         So I guess I was wondering if anyone can give me any insight about similar experiences? Alternatives? Suggestions?         Many thanks and prayers to everyone effected by this cruel disease.

My mom probable stage 4 still independent with all ADLs still is legally and medically competent still to make her own medical decisions (I have POA which will be activated when needed) but takes a lot of input from me.   She has anosognosia regarding her ALZ but is aware that her memory ""isn't as good as it used to be"".    Here's what I'm weighing:  at the moment her life is really impacted by the pain in her back and I think it will only get worse.  At the same time I know that for some patients surgery/anesthesia can cause the Alzheimer's to get worse more quickly.  In a way I feel like dealing with the pain is really important to her quality of life but at the same time I am afraid of taking the chance and risking a big change in her mental status.  If she would have back surgery in the future I would definitely make sure that she would be in a rehabilitation hospital or facility for as long as needed for physical therapy and follow up (usually several weeks).   Any thoughts?",False,kelantol,2013-05-03,422.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147525056,,,AlzConnected,,,

Then life besides Deb comes into play.  Besides my job I haven't had a lot of life besides Deb for 12 years.  However I have a long-time friend now grieving because her 31 year old son just died of Lymphoma.  He was married with two little boys - 2 &amp; 4 years old.  He was also a police officer.  I'm going to the visitation &amp; funeral for that this weekend.  My heart aches for her.  I also had to recently take a $6 an hour pay cut.  That hurts us financially and though Deb is Medicare/Medicaid qualified we've still spent a lot of money to make sure she's comfortable incidentals and other needs for her.  Not complaining about that.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  It all just adds to the stress.  My own body is crying out at me.  My Rheumatoid Arthritis worsens by the day - it seems. I haven't known for years what it's like to have a day without physical pain and I cover it up each &amp; every day I see Deb and go to work.   My rheumatologist tells me it's due to such a suppressed immune system and ""chronic stress.""  I can't go on any stronger meds because of being in a skilled facility daily.  It'd suppress my immune system more &amp; I'd get sicker than I do now.  It's one big cycle.  Haven't been to my pain management doc since Deb went into skilled care &amp; on hospice THREE years ago.  I'm just venting.  I think a lot about the writing His Daughter did on being strong.  There are many days I feel the strength is gone.  I somehow just keep going through the motions every day.  I wonder if there will be life after Deb and am ashamed of those feelings but over 12 years of having her in my care - with 3 years of it being very intense - has just about done  me in.  I keep asking my husband ""What will happen to Deb if I die before her?""  Some days I really worry about that.  You all have been my lifeline.  Even when I go long stretches without posting I'm still here almost daily reading.  God bless you all and provide you the strength to deal with all the stress of being a caregiver for someone you love so very much.  Thank you for the support and prayers you've given to Deb and me.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147521746,,,AlzConnected,,,

My husband and I spent our normal time with Deb today.  The only thing I can say is what her charge nurse at the SNF says and her hospice aide:  She looks like death's door knocking.  Her eyelids are so wrinkled and black.  Her face is pale and gray at times.  Her body is incredibly frail and shakes.  She sits in her chair watching tv or trying to sing or converse and just closes her eyes because she is just so exhausted she can't even hold them open.  I just held her and held her and held her today.  She wrapped her arms around my neck and just kept telling me that she loved me.  And I reassured her over and over I would ALWAYS love her.  We're having problems with her hearing aid and at this point in time I don't know what to do.  It's not the mechanical box.  It works fine.  I had the tubing replaced recently and that's not it.  It appears there's wax stuck deep inside the mold that goes into her ear which shuts off the amplification.  Of course since she's Medicaid in order to get a new mold made I'd have to take her to the one facility I know of in the area that does Medicaid hearing aids.  It's a good 45 minute drive from the nursing home.  She couldn't do that.  I don't have to take her.  Perhaps they could make an ear piece based on the last one.  However that would mean I'd have to pay for it instead of Medicaid.  Medicaid guidelines require the patient to be present.  And how do I know that she'll live long enough to even use it????  That's just one issue.  It's always something new.  My own body is in SO much pain and is SO tired.  Sometimes these days I wonder if she's waiting for me to go with her.  Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis for most of my life has taken its toll.  I saw my rheumatologist last week and he pretty much just shook his head.  I refused Prednisone because of side effects.  He tells me I need a lot of physical therapy and he knows there's not enough hours in the day right now for me to get it - so he told me to go see my pain management doc for him to try and sort out all the pain to see what is causing what and to give me injections under fluoroscope.  I've had enough of those to light up but I haven't had one in the last 2-1/2 years since Deb entered skilled nursing and I was told she needed hospice.  I'm so tired I can't keep things straight.  Someone on here recently asked how to keep balance.  I've been a caregiver for over 12 years now and I haven't figured it out.  I tend to the needs of my loved ones as best I can - but I don't know how to balance it out.  This journey is so incredibly lonely.  You lose your friends then there's siblings who don't help or turn their head the other way and don't see the toll it's taking on you or give you excuses as to why they can't help.  And it gets to the point where you wonder if you'll ever in your lifetime have any quality of life back.  I really think I've lost that.  I'm just at a very low point tonight.  I cried and cried over why Deb has to go through this and why God doesn't just take her quietly and quickly in her sleep.  I've prayed and prayed and prayed.  Maybe when the sun comes up tomorrow it'll be a better day.  I can only pray it will.,False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147519002,,,AlzConnected,,,

20,62108ede7b65de9a5b674f07,2147505727,2014-04-25 12:50:00,Things to have on hand,This is a post from Bela with some wonderful info:     In one of your posts you asked for ideas about other equipment/things you might need---I was thinking oxygen  - It she doesn't rally back it might be nice to administer while you wait for hospice to jump in---otherwise I would certainly make sure that you have it on hand once hospice is on board!!!!!       Also ensure for pain management purposes that  medicines are delivered regularly rather than wait for pain to surface and then treat; just treat to ensure she does not experience pain  Also please know that there are pain mes (and other meds) in the form of oral drops as well as patches and suppositories- most all meds come in a variety of forms to address different patient needs      I have heard of people experiencing excess saliva and there is a patch for that as well--     My friend and her mother and a caregiver provided care for my friends father for 15 years--on occasion I was asked to help out  Rest assured the hoyer lift is a piece of cake but a two person task---my friends use it to transfer their LO from bed to portable toilet---when he was in the hospitl during his final days no one even considered a portable toilet.  Rest assured many people just use diapers for urine and bowel movements-     It is perfectly OK if she receives only sponge baths!  My friends dad couldn't shower for approximate 7 years and he was clean as ever     There are baby wipes as you know but I recently found (also) face wipes for the face with a touch of aloe on/in them--might be refreshing for your mom- there is also no rinse shampoo and no rinse body cleaning products       Might you need eyedrop or eye wiping pads for mom and.or liquid tylenol and other OTC medicinals?  Barriet cream is a plus; urine and feces touching the skin repeatedly can break down the skin and cause irritation - avoid the irritation and ensure she receives barrier cream with each diaper change.  Use it as a preventative because that is what it is for.     Some people find it tranquil to have white noise (machines are available for sale); therapists often use them to ensure sessions can't be heard by people in their waiting rooms but i have also heard of kids and adults using them to sleep/at bedtime  Soft lighting (pink is soft)     Determining pain by Teepa--she has so much experience and I'm sure hospice is also skilled in this area but if you wish watch this copy and paste     Also if you are going to continue brushing mom's teeth child toothbrush a must.  Also there are non floride children's training toothpaste that can be swallowed  Rite Aid and Raleys grocery store carry's them but I would assume most drug store have it----you don't want mom swallowing floride toothpaste which can cause stomach upset.  Lip balm to keep lips moist- hospice will likely supply lemon sponge things for the same purpose     Standard pillows and body pillows are great for placing your mom's arm on keeping her from tilting to one side of another or just providing a quasi safe cushioned area-they are great -for relieving pressure at pressure points for her comfort how to's on internet and hospice can show you also     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kSjHtHSJCw,False,jfkoc,2011-12-04,20453.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505727,,,AlzConnected,,,

They also gave her Tylenol with Codeine for when pain is bad honestly all I felt it did was make her tired and didn't help with the pain or walking although it did make her rest and not try to move around too much because she was tired from it.         I Recently put a deposit on an Assisted Living facility and they are expected to have a room available soon and my Mom is next on the list.  I have separate general questions related to that and I think I'll post a new topic for but regarding the pain and difficulty walking I'm now concerned that may throw some new complications to an already emotionally physically and mentally challenging huge change and move for both of us. If nothing else it's going to make the move more difficult and if she is in pain it could taint the whole experience - being in pain plus being in a new environment.  I now wish I made the move to ALF sooner but I didn't and I hate to delay it anymore and pass this available room up.  Any suggestions?,False,linsam,2013-03-19,67.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147502066,,,AlzConnected,,,
22,62109e267b65de9a5b678e0d,2147501245,2013-10-24 19:44:00,New and near the end of the journey (long),My mom who is 90 has dementia and has been declining since my dad died almost 3 years ago.    She lives in assisted living in Florida with a very nice personal aide I'm in Texas and my brother is in NJ.    We should have moved her when my dad died but her cognitive impairment wasn't too bad then. She still swam every day and played bridge.    We thought she'd grieve for my dad and then resume her life with friends and activities etc. By the time we realized that wasn't going to happen she was settled in to assisted living and too weak to travel. We were afraid the stress of another move and a new place would be too much for her.    So we have visited her almost monthly (either my brother or I). Until this past summer she still knew who I was.    The last time I saw her was in July and she not only didn't know me she wouldn't interact with me and she just seemed angry and annoyed that I was trying.    She has been in hospice care since May 2011. She has wanted to die ever since my dad died but in the past few months she has become fixated on it asking constantly for a pill or for someone to help her pass.    This week she fell and fractured her hip. She is too old and frail for surgery so we are doing pain management. She is on morphine and refusing food and water.    I'm so conflicted. I feel like I should be at her side and I also feel like it won't make any difference to her she won't know who I am or that I'm there.    I think I'm angry at her for not trying harder when my dad died for giving up on life.        I don't know when to go. I have commitments in my life that won't allow me to just go and stay for the duration. If I go to see her now I may not be able to go back a short time later to put her to rest.         It's like I lost my mom three years ago when my dad died and it tears me up to see what she has become.        Does this make me a horrible person? Would lying to myself and pretending to be the devoted daughter and flying to her bedside be better?    I can't cry I can't care I love my mom but the body in that bed isn't my mom. I know she is being kept comfortable and not in pain and that is the most important thing.    If it were me I wouldn't want my children to see me that way.

23,6210a3517b65de9a5b67a25d,2147499818,2013-08-21 18:51:00,Nursing Home doctor advice,"Hi All     I'd like to do a reality check and see what others experience with their LO primary nursing home doctors.       Is it common for nursing home primary doctors to not consult with their LO's regular nurses to get their input on assessing pain or other issues?  What about asking the LO's POA?  Or even physical therapists that have worked on them in the past?     I ask because my mom's dr requested a family mtg to discuss pain management. So the mtg was today.  Part of me wishes I had called her to question why she wanted the mtg because I thought mom was doing pretty good!!! and wasn't seeing much of an issue nor were any of the nurses who I check with all the time including aides restorative therapy etc.. But out of courtesy to her I thought I would go ahead with the mtg and see what she had to say.      It was awkward. I felt on the spot because the dr put forth her concerns that she wanted to treat mom's pain which she thought was getting worse but there had been ""roadblocks"" in the past ( me limiting the amount of vicodin she got daily during bad back pain issue last winter) and she wanted to see what we could come up with to address this.  The mtg also included the Nursing home administrator( new) the DON ( SW was sick) the activities director and mom's nurse who joined halfway in and I wasn't expecting any of them except the SW and dr so it was a surprise.       So though I was uncomfortable I tried very hard to not negate the dr's point of view but how I thought mom was actually doing better since the back pain issue and yes there was a little bit more pain perhaps when I would prod her. I also shared my past experiences with mom and her pain  and horrible reactions to pain meds ( she knew a little bit about it) and that I learned from an old physical therapist to assess mom's pain by her actions and facial expressions AND if she volunteers it without me asking.  I also mentioned that her new physical therapist had told me she thought mom was having more pain because she wasn't walking as much and her muscles were getting tight.  By the way mom is still with it enough to tell me if something is bothering her so when she hurts bad enough you know and that's when I try to get more involved with it.      Though I said all of the above I think everything shifted when mom's nurse came into the room and shared his impressions. He said he thought she was pretty comfortable and improved since the back issue!!!!  And he also said you had to kind of prod her to find out about her pain. So yes I do think mom probably puts up with a certain amount but it in no way seems to affect her ADL's and she still participates fully in all the activities and eats well!       Once he spoke the dr shifted directions and started inquiring about more physical therapy or doing a pain assessment which I'm much more comfortable with. We also talked about increasing her walking a bit more. The DON seemed pretty responsive to all of that.  I also mentioned that we were trying lavender oil based on what a massage therapist had used and dr was okay with that.      Dr did ask me how I felt if mom's pain got worse and I said I would try to be more flexible and open to stronger meds.  ( back story- I spent two years  on and off in hell trying to unravel a multitude of medication issues with my mom in her old nursing home some were pain meds and it was difficult to figure out what the problem was. She had several psych hospitalizations and we were even discussing hospice at one point because she was in such a bizarre mental state refusigng care hitting biting not eating etc. )       Anyways even though we came to a solution I am comfortable with I'm still really bothered that the doctor seemed out of touch and hadn't checked with other staff. I can deal with that she might not want to  call me and ask my impressions but to not even ask the nurse when you are there at the facility? HUH? Just feeling a bit uneasy with the dr at this point and her judgement.       The other issue is that she only comes to see mom every other month as she is part time and the other visit is by a nurse practitioner one of two. In fact mom's issues have sometimes been handled by the doctor's partner and I worry about a lack of continuity as it seems like there has been 3 or 4 people involved and I'm not sure everything is getting through to her doctor. Or that the dr isn't as involved as she would be were she full time. And.....this is the practice the SW recommended I use as the other main affiliated practise wasn't great at returning calls and SW didn't think they were as responsive as these folks. SIGH     So- are they all like this? Could I expect a more tuned in doc or is this the norm? They come in ask the patient a few questions and take off without asking the nurses etc and god forbid the POA?  I'd really like to know. Right now I feel like finding another doc.   There are a few other things that have happened with the doc or one of the other partners that have bothered me and I'm just starting to question if this is the best fit.  I know I need to calm down but I would really LOVE to hear from some of you about your own experiences.

The back surgeon said they will not do any serious back surgery on her or another kyphoplasty.  It is heartbreaking to see her suffer and I am compounding that with guilt and anguish about having decided to let her have the procedure.  I have talked to friends and a counselor who have been helpful but I thought it might help to hear from those who may have had similar experiences.  I have been caring for my dear sweet Mom in my home for six years now - she has a multitude of chronic ailments -- and it is hard to bear the thought that I have contributed to her suffering and decline.  Any shared experiences of or suggestions for alleviating my own suffering so that I can be the best help to my Mom and as functional as I need to be to perform at a demanding full-time job would be appreciated.  Bertha T.,False,BerthaT,2013-08-03,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499424,,,AlzConnected,,,

Other medical issues include heart problems (leaky mitral valve moderate heart failure atrial fibrillation) and osteoarthritis. She lives in an independent-living senior residence where meals and activities are provided but no medical care or medicine management is available. I set out her daily heart medicines once weekly and she takes them on her own with occasional mix-ups.   The osteoarthritis causes significant shoulder pain. She has a vicodin prescription set up for as-needed and takes around 4/day. The prescription allows for up to 8/day. She tries to keep track of her vicodin use by writing down the time she takes one but often forgets. She seems to be in pain a lot of the time. I don't know if this is because the vicodin isn't working she needs to take more or if she waits too long between pills. Her memory and cognitive problems make it impossible for her to take them at regular intervals. Her PC offered a prescription to the BuTrans 10 mcg weekly patch cautioning that it's stronger than vicodin and could cause her heart to slow down.   I like the idea of a patch but have some concerns. There's a long list of possible side-effects. It can cause abnormal heart rhythm so people with atrial fibrillation and heart failure are given extra cautions. I'm not sure how safe this patch would be for her in an independent living situation. At some point it may be necessary for her to move to an ALF where they could give her pain medicine at regular intervals but she prefers to stay where she is at least for now.  My questions:  1. Have any of your LO's with pain management problems switched from pills to a patch? 2. If so how did it work out? 3.

On Sunday morning he confided to my husband that he was experiencing diarrhea. Let me say that I am actually happy he even said something to him because normally he does not say anything about pain or discomfort.     We have had to learn how to ""read him"" to determine if he is anxious or is experiencing any pain and have become extremely adept at figuring out when something is wrong.     So aside from the diarrhea there was nothing else noticeable that was different. Sunday night he got out of bed every hour nearly on the hour to go to the restroom. I know he had a horrible night of sleep and with Sun Downer's I was worried he would be grumpy yesterday.     He drank his breakfast yesterday morning and I managed to get him to drink just 8 ounces of water before lunch. Lunch went well and he had complete his lunch and were we sitting in the living room watching some tv I was finishing up my sandwich and saw that Gramps was taking a sip of some lemonade I had given him with his meal.     He began choking and could not keep anything down. His meal had been digested for about 10-15 minutes so it was just a lot of liquid that was coming up. I made sure he was okay and then helped him to the bathroom and gave him time to clean up (he tends to be private when it comes to bathroom issues of any sort) and then clean the area he had his meal so he did not have to walk back into the room and have a visual reminder that would cause him to be embarrassed about the incident.     Something . . . just a nagging feeling because of the diarrhea the day before a cough he has had for about a week complaints of freezing the night before when the air was not on in the house (he also has a heater in his room that is temp. controlled and we can set it remotely as well so it is not too humid in his room) and again just a feeling I had I called his Geriatrician. It was 4pm at this time and the office closes at 5pm so I was more concerned that waiting a day might be a bad thing and wanted to know if the doctor wanted us to go to the hospital instead. He did.     Last night I think I was there for about 3 hours before talking to the doctor. During the time he has been either our neighbor 8 eight houses down or living with us since we are his primary care giver's I have never been worried or concerned except twice. Both of those times were last night.     The first was when the ER doctor felt his abdomen area and her eyes became very wide. She kept moving around and asking questions to him about pain and then said that in addition to a chest x-ray (to rule out pneumonia) they wanted to preform an abdominal ct scan.     When the admitting doctor returns whom he saw just 3 months ago in the same ER came to explain the results he told us that there was no pneumonia. That was the only good news.     He was also diagnosed with a kidney stone that the doctor described as ""extremely large"" and is blocking his ureter. In addition he was diagnosed with Diverticulitis. They kept him in the hospital and said it would be more than likely a two night stay.     The doctor then asked me if he had a living will and any DNR orders. This was the second time I was worried because I know they don't ask that unless they know it is something more than what ""7-10 days of antibiotics can clear up"" and a visit from a Urologist to check out the kidney stone requires.     The Urologist has not yet visited him. They are monitoring his fluids and trying to make sure the bacteria in his intestines responds to the antibiotics.     Okay I am in NO WAY in denial about his condition. I know he is in late stage 6 Dementia and because when we visited today we did not see a doctor at any time to update us (yes we have Healthcare Power of Attorney Durable Power of Attorney and any other necessary legal document to make decisions for him) my husband is listed as the primary contact and is his grandfathers primary agent and I am listed second.      My mother in law thinks he is going to be fine and said in the ER last night that he has lived with Diverticulitis for years to which the doctor told her she was wrong because it is just a bacterial infection and is not a permanent condition. Tonight she is still insisting the doctor is wrong and we keep rolling our eyes at her inability to learn! She is complaining about the kidney stone and livid they have not seen him for that.     My husband and I keep telling her we are not worried because the kidney stone is the lesser issue and that the Diverticulitis is the most serious concern the doctors have and that we have as well. We know that at 90 he would refuse surgery and even if he agreed to it the recovery from such a surgery (my grandmother had 2 feet of her intestines removed due to chronic Diverticulitis about 20-25 years ago so even a healthy adult has a difficult recovery time) could be too much for him.     I have a horrible feeling that the doctors are not free with information because they don't want to alarm us that we may be looking at the possibility that he is experiencing possible organ failure due to the spread of the bacteria. Today he was being given Potassium when my husband was there because his levels were extremely low.     As realists my husband and I want to be able to prepare any final arrangements for his grandfather if it is that time and to be able to advocate for him his medical wishes and make sure that if he has a limited amount of time left with us that he is comfortable and pain management is a priority.     I am visiting the hospital in the morning and would like to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how to approach the subject with the doctor that if we are looking at a more serious issue to let us know so we can determine a palliative care plan for him.      Thank you for taking the time to read my long message and thank you in advance to those who can offer their own experiences if they were in similar situations.",False,TheWarden,2013-03-03,68.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147497233,,,AlzConnected,,,
27,6210b0e07b65de9a5b67d5b2,2147496648,2013-04-06 09:38:00,Searching for the right doctor,Hello everyone  This is my first time here and my search for information is what brought me to this website. My mother has not been diagnosised with anything and there lies the problem. She lives in a small town near Tallahassee and I am searching for a doctor that I can take her to in an attempt to get a diagnosis.  About 5 years ago she developed this headache at the base of her skull by the ocsiptal bone. Right about the same time she started having memory issues. She gets confused easily and repeats herself this has stayed with her and has gotten worse over time. My mother was always the person that could remember names and dates of years gone by. She never forgot anything!  An ENT told her that there was fluid in the mastoid bone and he proceeded putting her through a couple of surgeries to correct her sinuses the headache remained but her sinus issues have all be resolved. When she gets upset it hurts more she is easily flustered and has to go at her own speed. She will not listen to any discussion about dementia alzheimer etc. She is terrified and gets real angry.   Her father had some form of dementia but was never diagnosed. My grandmother took care of him until he died but it got to the point where he didnt know anyone and he would try to get out of the house at night. So I fear there is a genetic issue here.  The ENT referred her to a neurologist in Tallahassee after he was through with her and they did an MRI put her through a couple of memory tests and said it was old age. Put her on neurotin for the headache which did not work and she never went back. He also referred her to a pain management doctor who did steriod shots in the back of her head but it didnt give her any relief.  Her primary doctor referred her to a physical therapist for the pain in the head which she says one day he got right on that pain and as bad as it hurt he was able to move the pain a bit to ease it but it came back after the treatments ended.  So I have an appointment with her primary doctor when I go to visit in an effort to find the right doctor who can rule out if the pain is causing the memory issues or if they are two separate issues that just happened to start around the same time.  I will say that she has a friend that visits her everyday that helps keep her straight. I know that she is paying her bills on time and she doesnt get lost but places that she used to be able to go by herself seem to overwhelm her now and she has grown very dependent on her friend. Basically when this person is no longer available the decision will need to be made if she moves to Texas or I move to Florida.  I live in Texas and talk to her many times per week and do my best to help from afar. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to find a doctor that can help us. I thought the neurologist was the doctor who would guide us but it didnt turn out that way.,False,LT2013,2013-04-06,23.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147496648,,,AlzConnected,,,

29,6210cc747b65de9a5b6838b2,2147490670,2012-08-02 19:43:00,What is hospice today? (hint it's not just for dying!),"Associated Press article from July 2 2012      Article about hospice today:      With boomers coming hospice industry diversifies      By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press – Jul 2 2012       CONCORD N.H. (AP) — Forget that image of a hospice worker sitting next to a hospital bed in a dimly lit room. Today hospice care is delivered everywhere from the golf course to the casino.     As they brace for the eventual needs of the aging baby boom generation hospice providers are working to diversify their services and dispel misconceptions about what they do.     Chief among those myths is the notion that hospice consists of friendly visitors who sit in a darkened room and hold Grandma's hand while she dies says Robin Stawasz family services director at Southern Tier Hospice and Palliative Care in upstate New York.     ""It's just not what we do. We come in and help people go golfing or go snowbird down to Florida or go out to dinner several nights a week. We help them get to the casinos on weekends"" she said. ""This is not getting ready to die. This is living — living now living tomorrow making the best possible life with what you have.""     According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization an estimated 1.58 million patients received hospice care from more than 5000 programs nationwide in 2010 more than double the number of patients served a decade earlier. More than 40 percent of all deaths in the United States that year were under the care of hospice which provides medical care pain management and emotional and spiritual support to patients with terminal illnesses.     Both figures have grown steadily and are expected to rise as baby boomers — the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 — get older.     ""It's a complicated time and an exciting time but it's also in many ways going to be a very daunting time for hospices to try to find ways to take care of all these people"" said Donald Schumacher president and CEO of the national hospice group.     For the vast majority of patients hospice means periodic visits at home from a team of hospice workers. A much smaller percentage receives continuous nursing care at home or inpatient care at a hospice house.     Hospice is covered under Medicare Medicaid and most private health insurance plans. According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization 84 percent of patients receiving hospice care in 2010 were covered by Medicare. The vast majority of those patients received routine home care — visits from hospice workers as opposed to around-the-clock nursing care or inpatient care — and at that level of care the Medicare reimbursement was about $126 per day according to the organization.     Medicare covers hospice care if a doctor determines someone has less than six months to live and if the patient forgoes any further life-prolonging treatment though under the new federal health care overhaul law it will experiment with covering both curative and supportive care at a number of test sites nationwide.     In the meantime hospice programs are growing in number and scope. Recognizing that people are living longer and with complex illnesses they've been branching out into other ""pre-hospice"" areas for patients who are not terminally ill. For example some centers have become certified as so-called PACE providers an acronym that stands for ""program of all-inclusive care for the elderly.""     ""Hospices are trying to throw a broader net out to provide services to people before they become eligible for hospice"" Schumacher said.     Another trend is focusing on patients with specific diagnoses. While hospices for decades overwhelmingly cared for people with cancer by 2010 cancer diagnoses had dropped to 36 percent of patients served prompting some centers to develop programs geared toward heart disease dementia and other diagnoses.     ""We are realizing that while our roots were really in oncology that model is not the best response for all patients"" Stawasz said. ""We needed to really look again at how we were doing things. It is not a one-size-fits-all kind of treatment plan"" she said.     After working with providers and patients to figure out where traditional hospice had been missing the mark Stawasz's agency launched its specialized program for patients who have suffered heart failure in 2009. While there's usually a clear line between medical treatment and comfort care for cancer patients things get blurry with other conditions she said. So the agency started focusing on the reason behind each service rather than the service itself.     ""If the real focus is to help someone stay comfortable then that's hospice even if it's traditionally something a little bit more aggressive such as IV antibiotics or IV diuretics or that sort of thing or hospitalizations"" she said. ""So if the goal is for comfort and the treatment has a reasonable expectation to provide meaningful comfort then that's hospice.""     Though he praises such programs one expert in end-of-life issues says the hospice industry and American society as a whole are far from ready for the aging baby boom generation. Unless caring for people at the end of life becomes a larger part of the national agenda the rising tide of elders is bound to result in a flood of unmet needs said Dr. Ira Byock director of palliative medicine at New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.     He points out that while the number of people using hospice has grown the average length of stay actually dipped slightly in 2010 compared with the previous year raising concerns that providers aren't reaching patients and their family caregivers in a timely manner.     ""We often quip that in hospice care these days we're doing brink-of-death care rather than end-of-life care"" Byock said.     When it comes to illness dying and death the American mindset is ""I don't want to think about it."" But Byock hopes baby boomers will ""take back"" the end of life in the same way they took charge of the beginning by pushing for the natural childbirth movement and efforts to bring fathers into the delivery room.     ""It was driven by the boomers as citizens and consumers; it was an advocacy movement. A very similar thing needs to happen now"" he said.     Hospice workers say they are more ready than other health care providers to deal with baby boomers and whatever changes health care reform brings because they've been working with limited budgets for years.     ""We've been meeting that triple threat of providing better care with higher patient satisfaction for less money"" Stawasz said. ""I think hospice is perhaps standing as a model for others as we are dealing with the challenges of the increased needs that baby boomers represent.""     Laurie Farmer of the Concord Regional Visiting Nurse Association agrees. And she adds that hospice is all about providing individualized care something that baby boomers likely will demand.     ""The baby boom generation comes as very educated consumers and so we are feeling that we have been meeting that challenge"" she said.     At age 70 Liz Murphy of Deerfield N.H. is a few years older than the oldest baby boomers. But like many of the baby boomers served by the Concord hospice program she did her homework before deciding several weeks ago to move into the program's hospice house.     Murphy a longtime Statehouse lobbyist was found several years ago to have an extremely rare cancer of the connective tissue that settled mainly in her bones but also has spread to her brain liver and other organs. She started considering hospice after a spate of surgeries just weeks apart resulted in no improvements.     Murphy said she knew where the hospice house was but beyond that knew little about it before she started looking into it. But once she did she made her decision quickly.     ""I talked it through with my husband and my children and anybody else who I thought would have an interest in it and I feel as though I got information from as many people as I needed. I came and looked at it and I'm very happy with it"" she said.     ""It's been great. I love the place. I've been very fortunate that the people who are here are people who are happy to work with me and are interested in working together with my family my husband and me to give us the program we're interested in.""     Copyright © 2012 The Associated Press.

Through consultation with the psych NP, we have increased her dosage several times over the past seven months.
