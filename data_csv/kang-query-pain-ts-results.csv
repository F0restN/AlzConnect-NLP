He is currently in the hospital due to the fear that he would hurt himself yesterday.  He is being evaluated and having tests run.  The psychiatrist told my siblings today that he has dementia and is delusional. We are completely shocked at the behaviors he is displaying and the things he says to us.  We know that he certainly doesn't mean anything by what he says and cannot control himself but WOW!  I'm sure that most folks on her can feel my pain.  I have read a lot of great advice on this board and it feels comforting to know that we are not alone.

But it needs to be better than the truth.,"My mom got her Geriatric psych staff to call me today so she could talk.  She wanted to know how to see her husband (my dad). She had forgotten that he died a bit over 2 years ago. I reminded her that dad had died. She didn't really remember. Then she asked if she had another husband. I said no. Just dad.  Then she asked to talk to her son. I said ""Mom it's me!"" She said ""Oh good!!""  So my problem. If she keeps asking about my dad her husband what's best? They were married 55 years until he died. She didn't seem terribly upset to be reminded but until recently she has grieved about him almost every day. I don't want to cause her pain.  But if I give a fiblet that he's at home he's traveling he had to move to live with his brother she could easily be even more sad that he isn't visiting her. If I say he's sick she could just worry.  I'm having a hard time if a fiblet is better than the truth.  When I reminded her that he had died she didn't seem very upset.

She's mostly non-ambulatory and her ability to verbalize / communicate is limited. However she's communicative with her face hands eyes - very loving kind connected sweet. Her physical health is fairly robust - eats well at good weight other physical risks have been well managed. As her condition has progressed we do everything we can to keep her out of the ER and hospital because psychological stress has shown to be physically risky for her.  She had a fall recently which showed a lumber vertebrae compression. The vertebrae previously fractured in an earlier fall has become compressed and they are recommending surgery. I'm meeting with the neurosurgeon to discuss their recommendations and better understand the diagnosis inherent risks recommended procedure risks of the procedure and expected benefits.   My concern is that surgery for her could be a dangerous affair. Not doing surgery could be dangerous too. It's not clear to me that any of us understand how much pain she's in due to this compressed fractured vertebrae.   I would very much appreciate your thoughts on the risks of surgery for an 84 year old dementia patient. Is it absolutely a no-no to have surgery at this stage? What should I know? What should I make sure to ask while meeting with the surgeon?   Thanks very much for helping me prepare for this.,False,ninalu,2018-12-22,172.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558534,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'm writing now because I'm so anxious about my 77-year-old mom's imminent passing at home from dementia and my dad's reluctance/refusal to get outside help as in palliative care hospice etc. He has been caring for her at home for the past 13 years refusing help from anyone except me and not seeking medical care. He is the epitome of the stubborn independent proud private individualist. My husband was diagnosed also with Alzheimer's in 2017 at age 57 so we moved near my parents enabling me to help care for my mom while also caring for my husband. Mom is now sleeping much of the time with little to no cognition. Several times she's stopped eating and drinking for a day and had seizure-like episodes making us think it was the end only to rally and get back to ""normal.""   I have asked my dad repeatedly to set up at-home hospice or some sort of palliative care so that we will be able to give my mom pain medication if she is in pain when she does pass. He keeps putting it off and trying to placate me by saying he'll do it next week etc. and then he doesn't do it. I know that he's hoping she'll pass peacefully in her sleep and he won't have to deal with having a stranger in their home telling him what he should do. He doesn't think she will be in pain when she finally goes.    Meanwhile I've read all I can about the dying process so at least I'll know something about what's going on and how to help. But I can't prescribe morphine. Will paramedics administer pain meds if I end up having to call an ambulance (against my dad's wishes) if she's struggling at the end?  I really don't know how likely it is that she will pass peacefully without the need for medication. I'm going to insist that he call the doctor on Monday and if he doesn't call someone in palliative care to see what my options are. I'm extra anxious now because my mom hardly ate anything yesterday.    If anyone has some advice for me based on your experience I would really appreciate hearing it.

I feel inadequate.,"Hi everyone  I've posted once before and feel the need to vent again.   Mom is 76 and in addition to being stage 4ish Alzheimer's and Vascular Dementia she has pancreatic cancer and is on home hospice. She has been living with my husband and me since March this year. I am her primary caregiver.  The hospice nurse and I discovered yesterday that mom has a stage 2 bedsore on each butt cheek (the intragluteal region). Mirror image bedsores basically. She's been telling me for a couple weeks that her butthole hurts. She has been constipated and is taking morphine for cancer pain so a hemorrhoid is what we thought was giving her pain. Opioid induced constipation is very common and awful to deal with if it gets bad. Mom's extremely modest and wouldn't agree to us looking at it and we didn't push hard to see it which was a mistake.   I gave her tucks pads and got hemorrhoid cream for her supposed hemorrhoid. Still she had pain when she sat a certain way.   She is still fully mobile and walks around the house daily and sits at the table to eat etc. She gets up and walks to the bathroom when she needs to. She wants to have as much independence while living with us as possible. I think the cause of the bedsores was from our cat who adores my mom and tries to lay on her lap as often as possible. What cat lover would argue with that? But then mom would sit in the same position for a long time so she wouldn't disturb the cat. Plus the cat is chonky and weighs probably another 15 pounds.   So mom didn't understand that the pain from the bedsores was not from her butthole it is from bedsores. Still doesn't really understand and forgets immediately. I drew a diagram and taped it to the wall by her toilet paper roll to remind her. I know she will end up needing with them and making them harder to heal.  Now her big fear is worse. Since we didn't catch the bed sores sooner she has to drop her drawers for me to put cream on them 2-3 times per day in the hopes they will heal.   I'm having trouble finding a position for her to lay in that will take the pressure off the sores that she will continue to lay in. (She sleeps in a recliner because of arthritis.) She usually goes back to sit-lying in the way that gave her the sores to begin with.  It's also a battle to try to get her to bathe. She is weak and tired from the cancer already but she doesn't want me to bring in a home health aide from hospice or elsewhere. She'll backpeddle and say she wants me to help her. But when the time comes she's too tired and doesn't want it and refuses. I believe her.  Cancer causes exhausting fatigue and pain. But she has to be cleaned. Her skin is fragile and I'm more worried now about skin breakdowns elsewhere. She's just asking for an infection.  I think it's probably time to have hospice deliver the rental hospital bed so she could at least get bed baths in it from an aide if nothing else. But she probably won't stay in it.  I am leaning toward just making her do things she doesn't want and hoping she forgets about it later. But it's tricky because her mind can still latch on to certain memories and exaggerate them.   I'm looking at the title of this post and thinking ""no one could feel completely adequate in this position.""

PWD is in memory care.  Earlier this week we took PWD out for an evening choir practice.  I feared correctly that it would be a disaster when it came time to return to MC.  After about 30 minutes of delusional ranting crying throwing things threatening her daughter blaming her daughter I finally suggested that we get help from the staff.  Staff was very willing and patient and eventually succeeded without too much further emotional pain for us.  What amazed me was PWD's ability to suddenly put on a very credible presentation of a regular person who had no need to be in MC.  The wild-eyed hair pulling stopped.  The word searching stopped.  In fact her use of vocabulary was excellent and free flowing.  She was completely inventing a story about her having studied people in memory care when she was at the university.  Her findings had been presented at professional societies.  This is how she knew she did not belong in MC.  None of that is true but someone who didn't know would believe it.  I wonder if this ""presentation mode"" taps into a different part of the brain than the emotional mode she uses with her family.  It was really something to see the instant change when the MC staff person appeared  .",False,The Son in Law,2021-11-23,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559205,,,AlzConnected,,,

I just can't seem to do much daily - just the most pressing of the tasks of the moment according to my son's needs.  I swear dragging through each day just trying to keep up with his needs is making me more and more tired.  Can't get it together to ""do"" anything like holiday decorating no spirit for holiday baking  and holiday visiting is out of the question.   Since my son with EO is getting worse hanging around all day every day also tends to be worse for my spirits.  After all who deals well with the constant complaints and mini-traumas that never seem to end?  On the bright side we learned a lot of his problems and recent seizures are the result of his battery in his seizure ""pacemaker"" (VNS device) is almost dead.  It's serious enough that a neurosurgeon has squeezed him in for surgery this next Friday.  Here it is tremendously hard to get a surgery since the hospitals are all overwhelmed.  It's going to be a good thing but oh not looking forward to increased pain and irritability for days beyond until he heals up.  We already know his Alzheimer's behaviors will be pretty intense just for this procedure and recovery.

Im 3 hours from her but would visit often or have her here with me and the kids for months at a time and she was always so much better and always happy. My siblings live by me but rarely bother to even visit. I've been paying her bills fixing passwords and doing all the ""keep this between you and me cause people will think I'm crazy "" stuff since 2018. My step dad also always calls on me when he needs anything. She was last here 8 months ago for 6 weeks. She was wanting to go home and I offered to drive the whole distance since it was a day early and I guess this upset my step dad. He started messaging my older sister then I was told I'm a pain to deal with and why can't I stick to the plans. I finally got brave enough to ask why my mother couldn't come home if he's just sitting there and I'm doing all the driving. I guess that ruined it for me. I took her back at their arranged time and he didn't even hug her. He brushed past her open arms and left after she got in his car not saying a word to either of us. She was hurt. I told her not to worry everything was ok. I should have put her back in my car and kept her at that moment. She called me and I nearly fell over. She was on speaker phone and said she wanted me to leave her alone that I'm making trouble there and to stop calling. My kids and fiance were by me and their jaws dropped as tears rolled down my face as I pleaded begged and apologized for whatever it was I did and said how much I love her. She said goodbye and hung up. Since then she has just deteriorated tremendously. She sneaks to call me and says she is sorry and hopes I understand that she has to live with him and if she upsets him he's horrible to her. And he is. He screams about her not being able to remember anything and reminds her she has alzheimer's which you are never to do. I finally recorded it and him threatening to move if she ever came to see me. I finally called the local protection agency after years of holding back and now she won't even talk to me because they did a welfare check and he told her it was me even though it's anonymous. My siblings went off on me and said I made things worse and I don't love my mother. Im the youngest and we are the closest. She requested I do her POA in 2019 and not tell anyone because she didn't want to hear about it and knew i would do what was right for her. I did what she asked but unfortunately I didn't know to have it notarized. Now he took her and had a POA in his name done. She didn't request it she told me when she asked me that she just doesn't trust him. Well....my siblings are ok with her being treated this way and love that I am suffering. I wasn't allowed in the house since May he pushed her out on the porch when I got there the one time he allowed me and the kids and I took her to lunch and she had to find her way into the house because we couldn't even use the bathroom. Drove back home. Now she won't even talk to me since the investigation. Im sick. My kids are missing school and devastated because she is a huge part of our family. She has never stayed with anyone but us. The social worker spoke to my siblings and suggested they not me make 2 visits per month to give her much older husband a break. I was not contacted again. They never side with me and if she lived with me they made it clear they would not have their lives interfered with that it's on me AND THAT'S FINE! She never wanted them to visit when they did make an hour available for her because she has to act like she's expected to by them like I do. They are judgmental but make poor choices from their pedestals but have lots of money so it's excusable. My mother and I stopped going to get together years ago because her and I sat in a corner entertaining each other and snuck out asap because it was no fun for us. I don't know what to do. He's poisoning what is left of her mind about me and when he decides he's had enough I'm the only one who sincerely wants my mother with me. They plan to put her in a home. I promised her I never would let that happen. Please PLEASE give me any advice you can. Im desperate and shocked that the agency didn't even contact me or my mother's siblings who know this is a horrible change in character for her.",False,KWoz,2021-07-06,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893,,,AlzConnected,,,

My beloved in in a very good care facility. The staff are friendly and attentive and I couldn't ask for better care. The problem persists that 2 ladies one on either end of the hall are constantly screaming in terror. They certainly can't help it but the facility is unable to provide relief to these poor suffering people. CMS and other regulating bodies prohibit the use of sedative medications in long term care and largely any mood altering medications of any class(antidepressants pain medications anti-psychotics...). Before I get ""flamed"" I know their are exceptions but on the whole a nursing home will loose brownie points with the Medicare.gov webpage for reviewing care facilities and can be fined or lose accredation for providing the relief these residents desperately need. These poor people are suffering and are making the floor very unpleasant for the other residents many of whom don't understand why no one is rushing to the aid of someone screaming for help.   One more example of why people with a PolySci.or Law degree shouldn't be making regulations about healthcare. It seems even healthcare professionals once they enter a regulating body or political position lose any perspective on patient's needs.   One last note. If you are looking into placing a loved one into long term care try to get their doctor to aggressively treat any anxiety/depression or other mood disorder or pain problem in the community.

He's developed another UTI (less than a month since he got out of the hospital from the previous one). I've had to give him morphine for the pain.   His last BM was a week ago and he's taking miralax to hopefully get some relief. He hasn't had enough morphine to cause the constipation and eats cream of wheat with applesauce or yogurt at least twice a day drinks 5-6 bottles of Ensure plus 3 bottles of fruit punch or juice each day.   It was a struggle to get him to eat today. He would bite down hard on the spoon and I had to use mild force to pry it out of his mouth or he wouldn't open his mouth so I could feed him. He only had half a bottle of ensure then either refused to open his mouth for the straw or couldn't connect how to open his mouth.   He's stage 7 is bedridden and can't feed himself. His nurse comes tomorrow and I will discuss these issues with her. More UTI episodes are sure to happen with his incontinence even though I change him when he pees as soon as I notice it.   It tears me up to see him like that. I'm sure that's what we all feel but in late stage dementia it's almost like there's only the body still there. The soul is no longer present to give hope. His eyes are glazed and he can't respond to smiles or questions or turns his head when you talk to him.   For those who wonder he's only had morphine doses 3 times Saturday night and at 2:00 am and 2:30 pm today and the strength as prescribed. My question is at what stage or point in this process do we accept or determine our loved one has already left us?    This is a very dark time for me. I knew it was coming we all do.

You didn't explain why mom is not allowing Hospice. Is she refusing to even talk with them? Their nurse and/or social worker might just be able to explain to her what is in store for you as a family and how they can help (not just dad but all of you).  Is your caregiver trained in end stage care? Hospice can also advise you on your dad's current status and how best to care for him. If not actively dying he likely is transitioning. They begin withdrawing from their surroundings growing disinterested in contact and later mottled skin Cheyne-Stokes breathing glazed eyes cold extremities discolored toes etc. are signs the body is shutting down.   You mentioned his gurgling during feeding and being terrified that he will choke (aspirate). My DW has been there for months now. Hospice can also advise you on the choices you must make at this point. FYI during a recent respite stay at DW's hospice facility they refused to feed her so I went in daily to do so. I suppose their telling me how dangerous that is would be stopping just short of asking me not to. During active dying they reach a point where they no longer need or can process food. But my personal feeling is that stopping before that point is starving them. I wouldn't advise that unless you have Hospice care on board to keep him comfortable and pain free. Aspiration induced pnemonia is a common cause of death secondary to the underlying dementia IMO preferable to starving but better to keep him home with Hospice care than sending him to the hospital. Would your mom do the latter?

Two days after the diagnosis I sat down to talk with her hoping to have a conversation; I said ""remember that doctor's appointment the other day?"" and she replied ""oh yeah for my bad hip?""  I'm lost here. I'm not sure if I should keep trying to make her understand (writing a letter to her and taping it to the fridge having repeated conversations with her) which creates stress in the moment... OR should I just assume that she's NOT going to understand it and move forward without her input (finding a MC unit etc.) and brace myself for the inevitable stress pain &amp; anger she'll feel when that day comes? It's complicated. She's independent and has lived alone in a rural area since my Dad abruptly went to a care facility 2 years ago. She's even been cleared to drive locally after 2 sessions with OT driving evaluations. Basically she's functional enough to live a life of grocery store runs &amp; television... but I know that's not going to last long.    I realize everyone's experience is unique &amp; there's no blueprint to any of this but does anyone have any similar experience to this?

I noticed that my mom was pocketing food when she was sleepy so I asked that since her behavior issues seemed to subside to remove the Seroquel.  She still seemed sleepy so I also asked them to stop the low dose morphine they were giving her.  This was prescribed because the aids were having a hard time dressing her without her being in pain.  She has been in a wheelchair since her arrival to the nursing home 3 years ago.  She just forgot how to walk.  I decided to have her food downgraded to purée because with the nursing homes being short staffed I worried about my mom being fed too fast and choking. She also starting coughing once while I was feeding her a McDonald’s hamburger and then threw up.  I did not think anything of this because after she coughed she sneezed 5 times in a row.  Thought it might be because she sneezed at the same time and has a reflex spasm.  Yesterday I gave her a milk shake and she had no problems drinking or coughing but did start sneezing.  She does seem to have some post nasal drip as she has had this all her life from sinus issues.  Today Came in to see her and she was sleeping I woke her and she seemed confused and acted like she did not feel good.  Aid said she ate all her breakfast.  Gave her water and some hot chocolate and she seemed better.  Since I was there they asked if I would feed her lunch.  It was purée pasta and veggies.  I started with her drink snd gave her several spoonfuls of food no problem. I also mixed spoons of yogurt too.  She was doing fine and then I gave her a drink and a few minutes later she coughed and began sneezing.  Then she started gagging and threw up.  I was so scared because I never seen her gag like that.  Then she stopped and said she was fine.  Nurse took her temp if was normal.  Although she seemed tired.  The nurse is telling me that it’s due to her swallowing but could it be her hiatal hernia acting up GERD or post nasal drip?  I am going to ask for a swallow test.,False,Bentley6,2016-09-19,84.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559534,,,AlzConnected,,,

Back story - Mom was showing signs of cognitive impairment for the last 3 years while living in her own home (30 mi away) and caring for my adult brother who has Down syndrome. She refused all suggestions and appointments made by her doctor to go to a memory care clinic. I saw a huge decline during the pandemic where she was forgetting everything short term and also long term. I made myself sick with worry and ended up with high blood pressure. I contacted my brother’s day program and told them of my concerns and to contact me if they had any inkling of something wrong with my brother. Both had loss significant weight and she was not showering or changing clothes for almost a year. The more I begged and pleaded for her to get help the more she distanced herself from me. Then I got the call from his program..he hadn’t been there in 2 daysshe didn’t call and cancel him which was abnormal and the first day they called and asked her she said she had no idea why he wasn't there. Second day they couldn’t reach her. I went to her home and she could barely move was groaning in pain. Brother said she hadn’t fed him in 2 days. She refused still to go to Dr or hospital. I called her Dr who MHA’d her to hospital. She was severely dehydratedseptic and had pneumonia. She was also formerly diagnosed with dementia. The hospital docSW and her PCP all stated she needed 24hr care and that I needed to place her in a facility. She begged me not to and emotions were running very high. I was newly retired so I brought her home with me and my family and also my brother.  Needless to say it has been a long 5 months! We have had some great quality time together taking walks laughing and reminiscing on her childhood she remembers nothing of my life. It has also been very hard living with both her and my brother. Neither one can be left alone so we’ve hired a caregiver to come for two hrs twice a week she is very resentful of that and rude to the caregiver. I’ve missed out on my teen sons basketball games and outings with the family. We used to walk every evening as a family and tried to do it with them to no avail.  Anyways I spent months looking for just the right place for my mom to go. Finally found an ALF with a wonderful MC attached. Move in day is tomorrow!!! I was not going to tell her until tomorrow but just didn’t feel right about it. My husband and I have been there the last 2 days for several hours hooking up tvhanging shelves and photos making it warm and cozy for her. She asked today where husband was so I told her getting your new apartment perfect for you. She said but I am going home not to an apartment. In the past I would’ve said the drs won’t let you go home without 24hr care but this has upset her very much (she has anosognosia). This time I said your home is needing too many repairs (very true) and they can’t all be done in the winter (not quite true) so this is a temp place for you to go. She asked if my bro could go with and I said no because it is for seniors. She asked why she couldn’t stay with me which broke my heart. I told her I thought it would be fun for her to be around others who want to participate in lots of activities like she does. At first she said it felt like her body was being zapped all over. I just said I’m so sorry you aren’t happy about this we are trying our very best to make you happy. I said I met her new neighbor who was hoping she liked bingo because she needs a new partner. Well that lit her right up she said she loved bingo and hoped it wouldn’t cost extra. So far so good now she is peacefully reading in front of the fireplace.  A huge weight has been lifted I was feeling so scared about springing this on her at the last second. Still feel a bit defeated that I couldn’t keep her here but it’s not working for my very active family. My brother is waiting unbeknownst to them for a group home which could take a year but at least the ball is rolling. I’m afraid tomorrow will be very emotional but hopeful she will love it eventually. I’ve battled with guilt that I’m not doing enough but as I’ve read here maybe it’s really grief. I’ve also appreciated those that have said I’m not doing this to her but for her. I wanted so bad to arrange for her to be in her own home but couldn’t figure out how to do that safely and economically.   Sorry for the extra long post just needed to get this off my chest. Hoping and praying tomorrow goes as smoothly as possible. Also appreciate any tips anyone may have. Not sure how long to wait before visiting again I’ve heard both sides on that but would appreciate suggestions on that as well.

She also seems to talk gibberish when she is tired and pockets food so I asked that they only give her purée.  I also noticed that at times she will zone out and not answer me and then a few minutes later answer me.  Could this be from Morphine withdrawal or something else?  She does have an under active thyroid and takes medicine for it but 3 months ago when I  asked that they check her levels they were high.  Her thyroid doctor told me that the test results tell him her medicine was not given to her properly.  I immediately contacted the nursing home and they assured me that they will make sure she gets the med in the morning.  We have checked it every 30 days numbers have been getting better but still a little high.  They are checking again tomorrow. I want to make sure this is not causing her sleepiness.  I am aware this disease does progress and this could very well be a progression but I need to make sure it’s not something else.  It’s like pulling teeth to get this nursing home to run bloodwork.  All they tell you is that it is the progression of the disease.  I have heard this one too many times and each time before they were wrong and I was right it was something else causing her symptoms.,False,Bentley6,2016-09-19,84.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559620,,,AlzConnected,,,
19,6210238611c2270d5f1e3ecf,2147559577,2022-01-20 07:30:00,Difficulty staying awake after surgery,A little background so you can see where FIL was pre surgery -    FIL was placed in a memory care facility in May at the time he went in he was somewhat communicative could handle grooming toileting physically healthy etc. He was enjoying the place the food caregivers activities and had made friends.    Several events happened that may have led to major declines in his cognition (or maybe he is just progressing rapidly who knows) scabies which sounds innocent enough but the daily applications of creams were very upsetting. Soon after he started pushing and hitting other residents and walking became unsteady with a left foot drop. Spent some time in the hospital to rule out physical causes then spent about 3 weeks in a mental health facility to figure out some medication to help him calm down. That was September.  On the new medicines he definitely had more confusion and sleepiness but was also calmer and less agitated. He still enjoyed the company of his friends and us when we visited which was about every other day. He still knew us. He started becoming incontinent and required help bathing. He still fed himself but hands were shaking and had to eat more with his fingers.  Then the facility flooded in November and all the memory care residents had to be moved to a new facility temporarily. That was traumatic for all of them and very poorly done. The new facility is not well run and they did not have staff to handle the surge of new residents. Some of them were not unpacked for days   He had some new behaviors starting in December. Walking with a shuffle bending his head way forward. We asked for a doctor and PT consult but all we got was blood work (we have several issues with this place and the new nurse that I won’t go into). The last few weeks we received a call that he was walking too fast. He would hop up and walk at a very quick pace but was still unsteady. He fell broke his hip. He has no other comorbidities (physically healthy)  He is now in the hospital- he had surgery a week ago not a full hip replacement just enough to be mobile again. He had to have general anesthesia . He also has a UTI. It has been a week and he is still very difficult to wake up. He falls asleep being fed (has to be awoken between bites)  he falls asleep during PT. He cannot sit up or stand up without 2 people. He can only respond  with yes or no and even then it is not clear he understands the question. He is showing in a lot of pain urinating but the blood work shows no infection. He is not constipated.  In his sleep “state” he is talking laughing reaching for things he is constantly wadding up his bed sheets.  So my concern is - how do you know whether this is still coming out of anesthesia or this is the dying phase? How will they make the determination whether he needs rehab or hospice?  Our plan is to rent hospital bed and other equipment bring him here and have rehab or hospice at our home. We have a sitting area in our bedroom which is a good set up for this and a sheet hung for privacy. I have some experience taking care of my mom who had ALS - so I worked with lifts repositioning transfers bathing injections iv fluids and meds and such. She also had PT for a while for comfort not rehab. I am home 24/7 as is my grown son and my husband can do a lot of work from home.  We have one doctor telling us to keep him out of rehab because they are not equipped for dementia and his needs may not be met. We have another who is saying rehab center is better because they will work with him every hour. I can work with him every hour moving his legs (whatever exercises they tell me) and I can help a visiting PT get him standing and DH and I can do it when he’s home as well. Is there a lift that can help with standing? (I have not used one like that only for transfer). I’m sure they will rx a visiting nurse as well - I’m guessing once a week?   If it is time for hospice I am hoping DH will be willing for us to do this at home as well. I know his dying wish would be at home with family. My experience with hospice for my mom was very good - the support and respite was very helpful.   I don’t know where we are yet I guess the next few days will tell.

After a frustrating experience with a nursing home we have recently moved mom back to her home of more than 50 years where she lives on the first floor and is cared for by a live-in CNA. I live nearby and  visits two or three times per week to bring her necessities and to talk with her. She can still hold conversations and talk about current events and her memories although she sometimes can't grasp concepts and on her bad days loses track of where or when she is and who it is she is talking with.  Both at the nursing home and now with the private caregiver mom has a behavior that makes it very hard to care for her. Frequently when she is touched in order to change her diaper reposition her or provide other needed care she will shout that ""it hurts! it hurts!"" (or just ""ow! ow!"" or similar) and seek to push away or even to strike (ineffectually) the person trying to assist her.   We don't believe that she is in actual pain. The complaints only arise when she is handled not when she is unmolested. Doctors and nurses have looked for things that might be hurting her when she is handled and found nothing. And the complaints often start with the first gentle touch not later when mom's body is actually being moved or manipulated.  My best non-expert guess is that this is simply the best protest that she can muster given her current condition against the indignity of what is happening to her. And honestly I think that the fact that her caregivers are not white is a factor. Mom has been a liberal supporter of civil rights for her entire adult life but she was born in 1932 and raised in the U.S. South as the privileged daughter of a family that traces its lineage back to the early days of the state surrounded by African American servants and deeply ingrained caste system.   So I'm asking for ideas: What can we do to get mom to accept the daily care she needs? (Please don't suggest drugging her into a stupor to make it easier to change her diaper or hiring only white caregivers.)",False,John from Arlington,2022-01-03,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559367,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her current care team felt she was not at the stage where higher dosages were warranted for her behaviors cause they are manageable with proper inventions. I am just not willing to give up the time required to do so.  She has not been in the facility for a long just a couple of days and I am getting calls to take her home. She refuses to eat refuses to get up to go to the bathroom her paranoia and delusions have become far worse. I short she is losing all the functionality she had before which is not new. I did example to them that my mother was in a geriatric psych facility before and my father took her home at the facilities request cause she was getting worse and not better from her baseline and they felt she was not a good fit. My old man had a heart of gold and did not want to see her suffer so he took her home. When he took her home she was back to her baseline. More or less this new facility has told me the same thing that they are in agreement with her current care team that chemical therapies are not what she needs at this moment and they do not feel her quality of life would be enhanced by doing so it appears you see are most likely doing this for your own convenience and not the well-being of your mother.      I thought I could handle anything they threw at me I already knew what I was doing was not in her best interest but I am in this ride alone no family wants to help for understandable reasons my wife checked out also for understandable reasons. For the longest it was my father and I that rotated the responsibilities which made it bearable. My mother by her nature is a manipulative person that was her core personality trait before all of this. So I am hard pressed cause I spoke with my wife and she is most likely right that my mom is playing me. Though the stress of knowing she is suffering is unbearable.     I know it is harsh but turned off my phone but then my family has been bothering my wife trying to get into contact with me it appears my mother gave them my aunts number. Now my wife is getting dragged into this mess cause I am trying to find a treatment plan that will help manage my mothers behavior so I can find placement for her. Even when my wife brings up  that I am doing my this without any help they tout the same lines as always it is not our responsibility it is his mother he has the means to care for her but chooses not to because it is inconvenient for you guys. Which is not wrong if I capped out my salary and withdrew from my savings I could afford to place my mom where she wants to go. Though to do that that means my wife will have handle all of our expenses and that is not fair nor possible for her. She is a teacher she barely makes a fraction of what I make.      I knew this was going to backfire I knew that I did not have the resolve to hear that my mother about my mother suffering see my wife forcibly be dragged into this mess and judged because she refuses to help me care for someone that treats her like a sub-human. I knew my family would try to spin their hypocrisy and shame me into giving up everything. I was told today by them that I could always earn that money back but you can never earn time back with your mother. When I tell them I am young and they should not put everything on my shoulders they told me 28 is not young you lived a good life.    I am at a loss this choice has cascaded into a landslide of pain and heartache. Overall I dislike the situation but my actions to try and speed up the placement progression cause I cannot handle it is making this worse for myself cause my garbage family is making everything worse. I know the fact I have become lifeless is making my wife feel guilty for not helping which is not my intent nor desire. I do not want her help my mother’s wellness and wellbeing should be the responsibility of her entire family not just mine.   I reached out to her care team and they told me what I did expect would happen? They gave those recommendations for a reason sometimes medical interventions do not work. They did tell me I understand where you see coming from but the problem is your mother requires things that is not common in facilities and she cannot tolerate medication well enough so she can go into a common facility. They told me to accept your hand she will get worse with time and once she gets it is possible her behaviors will start to subside. It is the waiting game since she is in a weird spot. Her functionality is EO it is her working memory that is taking the impact. Her reserves in terms of physical functionality are extremely high for the most part she is operating on muscle memory. Unfortunately also means she does not trust new people she trusts her current doctors because many of  have been her doctors from before I was even born and one she even dated in the past. She is very close with them and for the most part can even have normal conversations with them.  I am worried say if I take her home and she does not get better and these behaviors sick.

I called the support line and they suggested I post something here to get some peer feedback. Has anyone needed to have their parent have dental extractions. My 84 year old mother needs a few extracted in a few different sessions. Actually several teeth have fallen out and many have broken off in her mouth since diagnose last year. Her mouth is a mess.  Mom is on the cusp of early to mid-stage Alzheimer's based on what I read and her MMSE score. Her normal neurologist which we have only had for 6-months is on maternity leave and I have concerns on my mom's reaction and what to give her to sedate her or possibly put her under. I have concerns with general anesthesia from what I have read and I don't think she would sit still through it without jerking if not under some sedation or something.   I need help with:  - Recommendations for trusted oral surgeons in the south bay that know how to deal with Alzheimer's patients and their needs and risks.   - Suggestions on something safe to possibly just sedate an Alzheimer's patient with vs having to put my mom under General Anesthesia.   My mom does not remember things long and we have discussed the need to remove her broken off teeth as it will affect her heart. We just got her dental insurance this year as she did not have it last year. She developed an abcessed tooth and we needed to take her in as she had fever swelling and severe pain in her mouth. Despite telling her she needs her teeth removed she screamed at the surgeon that she was not allowing any teeth to be pulled. (we have medical right of attorney for her).  In addition my mom had an episode of vasovagal syncope (passing out) while in the office with the surgeon as well. And my mom has tons of antibiotic allergies and the surgeon is concerned about doing procedure on her. Essentially the fainting and non-responsive issue freaked the surgeon out even though I explained it happens from time to time and I just needed to get her flat. The surgeon indicated she does not do extraction under general anesthesia and if my mom moves she cannot help her. I am thinking many likely do that and that research is next on my list. I was told I would have to either go to the ER and tell them my mom needs teeth extracted a hospital (but to whom) or a single specialist in SF bay area in SF to get this done. I feel deflated and I'm grappling for where to go next as I feel they are just kind of turning us away.  We asked mom's primary care doc for a prescription for something to calm her down and she said mom is good for general anesthesia to be put under but I am reading that can have possible big side effects on memory going forward. And driving her to SF and supposedly only one oral surgeon does that does not seem right to me.   - Has anyone who has had this situation have any recommendations you can share for dental extractions for a nervous patient.   - Anyone have an oral surgeon they trust and would recommend? I'm working between this oral surgeon my mom's primary care who I do not know if she understands the risk for Alzheimer's and her back-fill neurologist as our is out on maternity leave.

We are working on tapering him off lithium lexapro and donzepil and the hospital doctor agreed this is the best hope for his physical recovery. He is too much of a zombie otherwise. We plan to leave him on memantine for now. The reason he is on these drugs is that he was pushing/hitting other residents last fall so they had to medicate him. As he is now bedridden at our house he is no danger to anyone. We will keep evaluating talk to  doc and make changes if he needs to add any med back if needed.  Good news is he is more alert and communicative and cooperative during the day. He is more awake to eat and be moved around and is moving himself more around the bed. Today I played his favorite music and he was singing along. He is eating great vitals are good toileting is good. He is able to stand and be moved to a chair. His hands have been shaking uncontrollably but I believe that is getting somewhat better. Today he was able to hold his cup and drink.  But nighttime he is having major nightmares or anxiety. Any tips for that? I thought it was pain but when we ask he says no. He is mostly repeating words like “help help help” or conversations repeated cuss words... sometimes he is doing that while he pees (in the daytime too). He *really* hates peeing in a pull up being changed and fusses every time.   He is taking half dose of lithium and lexapro at night with the idea to wean off. Everything else is morning.

I had to make the decision to put my mother in a nursing facility about 8 months ago. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do besides having to preplan her funeral. I have 2 sisters who could careless so I was left with the responsibility of taking care of my mom.The guilt pain and depression is almost too much to bear at times.   Luckily we have a nursing facility very close to our home so I can visit her almost daily. It breaks my heart everyday. She doesn't know time she doesn't remember her home although she begs me every few moments to take her there. when I ask what color her home is she describes a home she lived in when she was 9. She's always says she's lonely but doesn't want to be around people. The nurses are having a hard time getting her out of bed or to eat. they have began giving her high calorie drinks due to weight loss. Her memory is much worse as the evening goes and it's hard to leave her. She doesn't want to let me leave because she says she is so scared.  I sometimes sit in my car and just cry. There is no one to turn to. I don't want to burden my husband since the stress can trigger the MS. No one understands. I don't mean to bother anyone here I guess I just need to vent. Its a blessing that I still have her and I should be thankful it is just so hard to watch her slowly slip away.,False,Ladywolf,2022-02-12,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559877,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mother is 83 years old came to visit on January of last year. She has Alzheimer's since 2013 she needed daily assistance with almost everything except going to bathroom. She had a wheelchair to use when we go out.  Due to COVID and travel restriction she could not return back home on time so we filed for a stay extension with US immigration.   Her condition declined severely in the last 2 month and she became a bedbound and lost her ability to walk  can not eat solid food in addition to extreme behavior changes. I am having hard time cleaning and rotating her because she screams of pain on her feet.  X-rays and hospital records confirms there is no broken or fractured bone. Sending back home on a non emergency medical plane cost close to 200K. Commercial plane will be next to impossible to use in her condition I highly doubt an airline will allow it.  I think she is in stage 7  so at this point I would think hospice care is what she might need.   Anyone knows how to get some sort of support at a reasonable price for some one in her situation where she has no medial insurance in the US. Thank you all for taking the time to read my post. God bless you all!    Update 09/24    Thank you for your feedback. I called few nonprofit hospice care.One of the companies were very helpful and offered a financial assistance. I signed up and they will start on Monday.

It was the second session with supervision from a very experienced private caregiver. We had a brief initial meet and greet visit that went well. In the first session my mother asked to leave to visit a friend in an apartment on our floor. That day the caregiver's distractions worked. Yesterday my mother was angry and swearing under her breath to get this evil woman out (the caregiver looks a bit like someone my mother had a dispute with). It got so bad that I had to delay my work appointments and asked the caregiver to leave and come back in 15 minutes. Nevertheless my mother kept asking me to take the caregiver with her although I said this was my friend who I had known for years. She wasn't violent but twice made motions as if to bite me. She made statements such as the caregiver can't stay because I need to go out to meet someone (not true). For the first time my mother had a hallucination. The door was open and she waved and said hello to someone who wasn't there. I distracted her and left when she was in another room. Then my mother called me as I was driving. I distracted her by talking about food and promised to bring her baked treats. The caregiver tried to engage her in conversation but found that being mostly silent presented less of a trigger. Due to increased confusion I had her urine checked and there is no UTI. I tried to manage her back pain by giving her a strong pain killer.  Please provide any suggestions as I fear the caregiver will quit.  Thanks in advance.  Edited to add that today was even worse. The caregiver was almost struck and had the flee. My family doctor had left for the day and the receptionist said ""there's nothing the doctor can do about that. They go through stages"".

Thank you in advance for being willing to take time to read all of this.*   I am a 31-year-old only child of a 78-year-old mother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018 but showed contributory signs of the disease in 2015. I am a part-time college instructor who has chosen to move back home with my mom to take care of her full-time. I have been her primary caregiver and attorney-in-fact since 2019. According to the seven-stage model Mom is solidly between stages 6 and 7.   Being an Alzheimer’s caregiver is such a dynamic experience isn’t it? With all the ups and downs there never seems to be any kind of stability even when the progression of the disease temporarily plateaus. You automatically take on the roles of parent personal accountant legal advocate confidant nutritionist home aide teacher friend enemy and counselor. You often have to forgo processing your thoughts and feelings because you prioritize your affected loved one’s thoughts and feelings as well as those of unaffected relatives and friends (by  affected  and  unaffected  I mean “diagnosed” and “not diagnosed” respectively). You deal with relatives’ unsolicited uninformed opinions as they talk negatively about you behind your back yet don’t make any efforts to help and objectively have zero clue of the gravity of the situation because they never visit or directly observe day-to-day activities. At the same time you deal with the same individuals’ anticipatory grief because the reality is they also have some sort of meaningful relationship to the affected loved one.  I’m at my wit’s end. I’m tired angry sad disappointed drained and hopeless. It’s weird to be between the stages of grieving the First Death which is death to pre-decline life and anticipatingly grieving the Second Death the actual physical passing. It’s frustrating to do every single thing I possibly can to make sure Mom’s well-being is in tact with integrity but those who only see a fraction of a fraction of what Mom and I daily endure continue to be impossibly negative and ignorant. I’m angry that the long-term care system in the United States seems to be designed to take every single thing from you and the affected loved one including either selling all assets pre-facility or risking an asset seizure post-facility/post-Second Death. I’ve talked to several senior care specialists elder law and estate law attorneys social workers her family medicine practitioner neurologist prescribing psychiatric nurse and her mental health counselor and the conclusion is that time is not on our side in figuring out how to pay for long-term care without sacrificing an arm and a leg for Medicare and Medicaid to contribute.   The simplest of tasks such as raising her arm is even a cognitively difficult request. She sleeps a lot. She no longer explicitly expresses hunger thirst emotions or pain. Her motor skills are slowly but surely declining. She doesn’t know what to do with a phone or remote control or book anymore. She doesn’t know any identifying info about me or herself (I’m often her father or little brother but never her son). I’m struggling to keep my professional life organized and healthy and my personal life balanced.   I feel so so alone with limited solutions. The facts are I’m not a speech therapist nurse OT or PT and I cannot give her the 24-hour care she desperately needs. However because of money we just don’t have any other choice right but for her to stay home and for me to stay with her. Whether I choose to sell her paid-for home that’s on family land in order to qualify her for Medicaid or choose to keep her at home I will always feel guilty. There’s always a give-and-take with these kinds of situations. That’s part of the reason that I feel weird when someone else says “You are such a good son. She’s lucky/blessed to have you.” I understand and appreciate their sentiments but I’m just doing what needs to be done and I simply love and want the best for her.   With all of that said do you have any insight regarding how to deal with this kind of solitude?,False,CJJE,2021-03-10,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147555971,,,AlzConnected,,,

This issue is this:  She does not understand that she should not try to walk.  If left alone even for a few minutes she will attempt to get out of bed.  We are currently paying extra to have private caregivers with her 24 hours per day to prevent her from getting out of bed and trying to walk. We are concerned about her falling and re-injuring herself. We are hoping to find a way to keep her safe but not require the expense of a private caregiver 24 hours a day.  She still lives in the memory care facility.

My spouse is off on a well deserved trip of his own for several days so I was looking forward to the visit with my friend and then a quiet few days in my sewing room   Here’s how today went:  left the house at 9:30 picked  up the parents at assisted living  for doctor visits. Did that. Had a chat with the doctor in private regarding my need to pull back some from their care ( ruining my marriage and my sanity)  and  about some of Dads stubborn and callous behavior - which the doctor saw today. Dad supposedly doesn’t have dementia.  Doctor thought mom was doing much better cognitively after 6 weeks on the antidepressant mirtrazipine. Doctor ordered blood work and X-rays on Mom because of her back pain  So we went to lunch and then got X-rays.  Then took them to the phone store because Dad wanted a new flip phone.  Dropped them off at 4 and then went home. Tried to rest- my knee is bone on bone. Got the X-ray results communicated with my sister for about an hour on those - she’s an expert on back medical terms. Ate a snack did some sewing. Forgot to eat supper.   Here’s the bad part/ got a call from  my stepbrother at 9.  Dad( actually he is my stepdad) made a pass at my step brothers girlfriend at my step brothers house yesterday. This type of behavior is nothing new.  Done it all his life. Made mom’s sister so uncomfortable 6 years  ago that she  told mom. Now she and mom don’t speak. Then he called my stepbrother tonight like nothing had happened. Who told him off …. On speaker and my mom heard it.  So then my stepbrother calls me to fill me in my mom tries calling repeatedly while I’m talking to him. He also tells me that my stepsister was helping Dad move all ‘his’ money to another  bank.  This is money that was originally in a joint account and he moved it to under his control two years ago and is now trying to move it again why?  Because I’ve made him pay bills out of it that would have come out of the  joint account  had he not moved the money.  I’ve had possession of the checkbooks since neither of them now know how to write checks or balance a check register.   Earlier Today I had him sign checks for his health insurance and the pharmacy bill from ‘his’ account  he used his debit card to pay for the  phone.I mailed those checks on the way home.  So now I find out that there may not be money in that account to cover those checks. I have no online access to that account since it’s only in his name.  So I have  to call the bank tomorrow and explain the situation and see if they will at least tell me if those checks will clear   I had to call both my sisters tonight about this - who live out of state and aren’t interested in helping but they  did listen. So now it’s 130am and I am still awake.   I really wish I could walk away,False,Quilting brings calm,2020-10-16,719.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558205,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's a small room in an older home where my mother has one roomate. The staff really seem to care. After a few hours I tried to frame the facility as a temporary rehab. My mother is able bodied and said no she doesn't need that.  My mother mostly thinks she is in a hotel and asks when we will be checking out. Some times my mother thinks she is in her town of birth. For the first four days my mother constantly packed and repacked her belongings away until I removed most of the bags. She is using the telephones of either other residents or staff to call me at all hours to ask when I am returning to take her home. She sounds sad and scared. It breaks my heart. Staff said she mostly walks or sits upright in a chair. This has led to significant back pain. Sometimes my mother doesn't eat and is resistant to meds. She goes into the rooms of others.  Today was the most painful. After eating well I tried to leave. There were no activities that I could use as distractions so I tried to say I was going to speak to someone or use the washroom around the corner. Each time my mother said she was coming with me. When the nurse managed to distract her I literally ran away quickly. It looked like a movie and other residents said ""why is she running?"". My mother quickly saw I was gone and started running after me. The nurse advised me to use the stairs however I didn't have the stairway code. Luckily the elevator came quickly. However now I can hear my mother saying ""I am your mother. Please don't leave me"". I was guilty on Monday but now the emotions are worse. She has lived with me for several years and now she feels abandoned and is wondering why she is in a strange please with people who look sicker than she does.

I’m 95% certain it’s time for my mom to be in one.  The proverbial last strawberry happened earlier this week when my mom physically assaulted my father. It’s not the first time but it was intense and I fear it could escalate by her just happening to be near something sharp and grabbing it.   My father has been in a lot of denial understandably as her primary caregiver.  I sat him down and told him we are at a point where it’s too much for him it’s not safe and they’re both suffering.  She’s not getting the care she could really benefit from and his mental and physical health are suffering.  Mine is too as I’m at their place several days a week and have started neglecting some of my responsibilities.  Compounding all of this is an upcoming hip replacement in three weeks which I know can greatly exacerbate her cognitive challenges    I have visited six facilities near them and I liked them all and know she would benefit greatly.  My father is despondent at the thought of her not being at home all the time and I’m trying to get him to see he will get the best of both worlds in an impossible situation:  he will be able to do things he can’t while getting to be a husband again while she gets care she needs     Back to the 95% number. That 5% doubt is when she shows flashes of her old self.  There are some times when she’s fairly lucid although it’s fleeting.  And there’s the hope that perhaps after surgery when she’s not in pain she will rebound a bit (she will be spending 1-2 weeks at a skilled nursing facility and then would go to the MC facility or home).   I imagine everyone struggles with this decision so anything that anyone can offer with a terrible awful decision would be much appreciated.,False,Andy Easton,2021-08-02,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558417,,,AlzConnected,,,

She made her wishes clear in this kind of situation so all we can do now is make our precious mom as comfortable as possible as she transitions.  I am in shock pain and immense grief.

I am grateful that I was able to speak with her via Skype just hours before this happened to have had one last conversation with her.  We are visiting her daily reading to her playing her music and she knows we are there. She holds my hand so tight and while she cannot really speak or open her eyes I am cherishing these moments we can still have together.  I guess I just wanted to share this news as this community has been so helpful and kind. I am at a loss for what I will do without my mom.

My mother is 85 years old and has vascular dementia. She is completely immobile and her food intake is at about 25 percent. Her liquid intake has declined to about 3 cups a day. She spends most of her time sleeping but she does frequently yell out with physical aches and pains. She has a stage 4 pressure sore on her coccyx and two skin tears. We recently had to move her to long-term care because there was a shortage of in-home caregivers and we just couldn't provide the care she needed.  On Friday the facility let us know that mom tested positive for Covid. She had been vaccinated this summer. I have been in touch with her facility nurse and hospice nurse daily since the diagnosis. Her Covid symptoms have been mild to nonexistent with the exception of extreme fatigue and disinterest in food and drink (which were already going on before the Covid). Today the nurse called to tell me mom has been in extreme pain. She said a simple touch to the arm will make her yell out in pain. They have been giving her morphine and methadone. When the nurse called today she stated that she had promised me she would call anytime she noticed a significant change in her. Reading between the lines I deduced that the nurse is saying it is bad.   Has anyone else on here had an experience with a loved one with dementia being diagnosed with Covid? I am particularly curious about Covid-vaccinated patients with dementia testing positive for Covid. Because the vaccine is so new I can't find much information out there regarding this topic. If you all have any insights into what this experience might be like for someone in her condition I would be grateful if you would share.

The dentist wants us to make a 2.5 hour appointment for restorative work and a new crown. Dad is Stage 5/6 and probably has life expectancy of two to four years based on what I know of his condition. He also has stage 3b chronic kidney disease but no other health problems. The only alternative to restorative work mentioned by the dentist is extraction. Dad's PCP said she would defer to the dentist's recommendation but she advised me to question the need to do anything and said maybe antibiotics could be tried if the tooth causes problems. The problem with that approach is... potential for excruciating dental pain and a trip to the ER. I've read some of the dental message threads on this board but still don't know what to do to minimize Dad's discomfort and risk of infection. He can no longer maintain his dental hygiene but won't let us help him brush and floss. I would kick the can down the road and just get the crown done for him except I don't know if he could tolerate and cooperate in the procedure itself and I also don't know if the new crown will deteriorate quickly if he can't brush and only wants to eat sugary foods. The dentist won't talk to me over the phone and wants me to come in with Dad for a consultation probably because of HIPAA rules. She is a good dentist but I don't think she realizes what a hurdle it is for me to get time off work for yet another Dad need and to get him dressed and to an appointment. I'm looking for a geriatric or palliative dentist who understands Alzheimer's and would give a second opinion except I can't find one in my searches - just a bunch of dentists. I want to speak to someone who understands where I'm coming from. My primary goal is to prevent him from ending up in urgent care/ER in excruciating dental pain. My secondary goal is to simplify his care and avoid complicated treatments and care instructions that are simply not going to work. How do you find an Alzheimer's dentist?

Yesterday she was complaining about the pain in her leg being so bad and when DH and I helped her stand she almost fell over in pain and she got teary-eyed. We decided that she needed to go to the hospital to make sure she didn't have a serious injury but we couldn't get her to walk so we called an ambulance. The ED determined that she did not have any broken bones just a lot of soft tissue damage and they told her to take Ibuprofen and rest and to use a walker when she needed to get around.  Of course once we got back home MIL seemed unable to walk and kept complaining about the pain but left alone in her room she was on the phone chatting and texting and watching TV like nothing was wrong. Once one of us went in her room she'd grab her leg and start moaning &amp; complaining and crying that the pain was so bad....she was honestly like a small child seeking attention.  This morning she complained to DH that her leg isn't any better today even after staying off of it for a night yet now that he's at work I can hear her getting around upstairs and not a peep about pain. I'm sure if I went upstairs though I'd get an earful.  How do I handle this without going off on her and accusing her of acting like a child?  Both DH and I are at the end of our patience with her behavior.

I mentioned in my last post that my step-dad is the primary caregiver and POA and he has done nothing to set up assistance. He was bound and determined to be the sole pillar of support...and then he had a knee replacement surgery last week ended up stuck there all week with low oxygen low salt high pain and developing pneumonia. As my mom's only child I was her caregiver in-stead and my older step-brother was the primary contact for his dad.   Because she needs 24-7 attentive care and because I normally live 2 hours away I was unable to leave. I couldn't even sleep in a different room or be away from her side more than 20 minutes at a time in case she needed water or the bathroom or got distressed. No assistance had been hired and I don't have the financial resources to do that on my own (let alone the time it takes to set up in-home care).  Yesterday my brother and I moved her into a rehab facility that also specializes in dementia care. She is currently being watched in the alzheimer wing until my step-dad is well enough to transfer over. Then they'll have a joint room. Leaving her there was one of the hardest things I've done even if it was a relief.  I'm home for the first time in a week and technically able to turn ""off"" but everything is hazy. I had to go in to work today and I'm supposed to log my activities each hour...and I'm losing time just staring or doomscrolling on social media and I don't know how to justify my actions without losing pay.   I lost 5 lbs from stress last week and I'm currently trying to make sure I eat and take care of myself. I got the first good night's rest I've had in days finally. But I'm definitely not myself yet.   How have you all dealt with recovery and exhaustion after crisis periods?

She is morbidly obese and has mid stage Alzheimers / Dementia. The initial diagnosis by the AL MC facility doctor and staff was that it is osteoarthritis based upon their examination and xray of her leg. They had also noticed some lymphodema and were wrapping Mom's leg or having Mom wear compression socks. I have also talked to the staff about applying ice packs to her leg and that does seem to help a bit. The facility doctor has also arranged for light physical therapy and a knee brace. We have also tried to work with the AL MC staff to minimize her snacking to hopefully cause her to lose some weight but don't that doesn't seem to working. These are all treatments that are recommended for osteoarthritis.  Mom was sure that it was a problem with her leg bones so I took her to an orthopedic doctor who did more xrays and informed us that the bones in her leg as well as the knee and hip replacement hardware are all in place and looking fine. Because Mom didn't get the answer she wanted she thought the doctor didn't know what he was talking about and thought we wasted the day.   I took Mom to another PCP who examined her leg and told her that Mom that she saw some signs of lymphodema and that compression socks and water pills were appropriate. The doctor didn't think it was gout or cellulitus. This doctor did do some blood work to rule out stroke and and the results came back that Mom was having some issues with blood flow in her capillary veins but nothing major. The doctor recommended we try using gabapentin to help with the pain by treating the nerves in her leg. We have increased the gabapentin three times in the past couple of weeks but it still doesn't seem to be working. The last remaining thing the doctor suggested was an EMG test that checks how the nerves are firing in muscle tissue. This is our last resort.   Going through this process it is obvious that my mother is struggling to understand what the doctors are telling her. She just wants a quick fix and I am afraid that doesn't exist. And I am struggling trying to explain to her that there might not be a fix for it and she may just have to live with it. I am afraid she will continue to complain about it as her memory continues to decline and I will have to get in a mode of making something up each time regarding treating it. I am also wondering how much of the pain is in her mind versus actually physical.   I will continue to work with the AL MC facility staff to try to manage this situation as I can't continue to rack my brain on possible medical solutions or to continue to take her to doctors who just confirm what we have already heard. I am sure there is no easy fix or even a fix for this situation and it is wearing me out. I can schedule her for an EMG test but frankly I don't think it is going to solve this situation and it will cost a lot of money.

My dad did tell the protective service lady if he had to pick a guardian it would be me.  He also said definitely not my sister and her crappy husband.  He has been a major pain who believes he has every right as a husband to directly involve himself with my parent's care decisions.  In fact he believe he had a biblical right!  I am so heart broken about my Mom and this new trust I was always her favorite I'm the baby and now i is obvious my sister has her being manipulated and under her control.  Do I fight and file for my dad's Guardianship or stop being apart of this fight and surrender?  This is a major stressor upon dealing with my dad's dementia everyday.  Oh yes I do 80-90% of my dad's caretaking my sister and brother show up maybe once a week for an hour or two.  Yet has the nerve to file for guardianship.,False,bozowing,2021-07-23,44.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147557715,,,AlzConnected,,,

I believe that Mom's ""dementia"" was mostly aphasia. She was not officially diagnosed. She could read out loud accurately but she couldn't string words together on her own to make a meaningful sentence. I believe our speech was probably garbled by her hearing in the same way. She seemed to think pretty clearly but couldn't express what she needed. Her memory was good. When we listened to her ramblings we could eventually pick out a subject and then guess from there. Hand motions and facial expressions (without masks) were more effective. She also had trouble with numbers calendars and clocks; not knowing what was higher\lower earlier\later etc.  After a fall landed my Mom in the hospital they recommended Skilled Nursing (SN) for physical therapy (PT). It was hard for us (husband of 69 years and 3 children) to know if\where she hurt and how much. Mom was VERY active walking\caring for herself etc before the fall. I asked for SN references from her Memory Care unit. The first 2 we talked to said they couldn't accommodate her with her dementia. The third still had a fair rating but I was beginning to get concerned about the level of care she'd get. The hospital talked to them and they accepted Mom without even talking to me. I'm guessing I gave the first 2 too much information about Mom's activity level before the fall? I think the hospital was pressured to move her out.  She was making some progress in SN and they were planning her discharge. But communication with the facility was frustrating to non-existent. MC couldn't get the records from SN to know if they could care for her. I live out of state. So the first time I saw her was on the 15th day. She didn't recognize me fully gowned and masked per COVID restrictions. My observation was that she seemed to be in pain and cold. I expected the aids\nurses to know more about that than me. So I asked and told them what I thought. They brought a warm blanket and I think they gave her a pain med after I left. I was also there to be with my Dad who was living in MC with Mom because they couldn't stand to be separated. Dad was in AL but was starting to have Parkinson's dementia so he technically qualified for MC also. Anyway I couldn't be with either of them constantly but I visited each one each day. Nor could my brother who lives nearby but he has a fulltime job and active family. We are dependent on the ""experts"" to know more about dementia than we do!

The problem is she thinks the doctors/being in the hospital 3 years ago was what caused her memory loss. She fell on the ice and fractured her hip and was in the hospital and in a lot of pain for a while and it coincided with her onset of serious dementia symptoms. She has refused to go since then multiple times a day stating that her brain doesn't work since she went to the hospital and the doctors did something to her brain. She also struggles with depression/anxiety and did before her diagnosis for years. The past couple of months she's spent a lot of time saying she wants to die and she's sick and to let her die. This week my grandpa (her spouse of 60+ years) passed away. Now she's beside herself with depression confusion and frustration and just wants to die. It's hard now to differentiate between normal grief pre-existing depression and her disease. Regardless I desperately want a doctor to evaluate her. I don't know how I or my mom would be able to get her there. I'm afraid of her anger outbursts and her mistrusting me if I take her but I'm more afraid of how things will progress without a doctor visit/guidance. Am I just stuck being the bad guy and have to live with that for a while with her? Does anyone have any advice on how they've handled LO's fear/mistrust of the doctor?

He has sciatica and we have been to doctors he take medications and pain pills for it. Example 2 (next day): I hear him doing something in the living room it's midnight so I get up to find him fumbling around with the TV and his DVDs. ""Dad what are you doing?""

Add some elbows. Great to put together and pull apart.      For people who liked fishing an old fishing box with different kinds of lures (hooks clipped off) to touch and feel and admire.      A board with several locks and keys attached to open and fiddle with.      For the later stages windup toys things to squeeze rattle or manipulate in other ways.      Washing the family car. The results will be far from perfect but that's OK      Bubble blowing           Don't forget the mid-day snack. Your LO may enjoy making and eating it.        Sensory stimulation:   put a few cotton balls in old pill containers (the kind you get from the pharmacy) put a few drops of vanilla chocolate extract lemon extract etc.  or even one or two perfumes in them and let your LO sniff at them.  Try spices like oregano basil mint. etc.    How about music. Try different sounds to see if your LO likes them. There are wonderful sounds in ""relaxation"" type music. Also try old music from the 40s and 50s.  I am an nurse who worked for years on dementia units. My residents LOVED gospel music especially the Statler Brothers.      OldTime Radio Shows on CD:       http://www.vintagelibrary.com/OldTimeRadio/            Touch - a bowel of rice to run their fingers through or petals from flowers to touch and smell Does a neighbor have a dog or cat they can pet?  Or consider getting one of the animated dogs or cats that look real.  Bring  in some snow when the weather gets colder. Let your LO experience it once again. You can think up more based on her background.  The idea of sensory stimulation is to help the person remember what things feel like or smell like. It might trigger a memory and you can gently ask and pry a bit to get your LO one to remember.  Same with the music. I had residents who could not string 3 words together but remembered the lyrics to some of the gospels or older songs.  Try blowing some bubbles around them and see if they catch their attention enough to poke at them.  Let your LO wind yarn if they can or sort socks and fold wash cloths.  If your LO is a female give her a manicure and polish her nails. She might like looking at them. If not you can remove the polish.  Give your LO seed catalogs to look through. Loads of great pictures of flowers.  If you do find something they like  don't forget that they have a memory problem. You can use the same thing over and over again.    When wandering is a problem         Many people with dementia go through a stage when they wander. It is up to the facility or family at home to provide a safe wandering area. It is often helpful to devote a room or area to things the person likes to rummage through or look at. Pictures books items to touch and take with them as they wander.       Make sure there are no obstacles in the way of the person's wander path. Think about taking the person on walks outside especially if a patio or backyard is available. At home doing things like walking the dog or even helping with tasks like raking or washing the car help expend energy and may reduce some of the need to wander.       Remember wandering is a ""phase"". It will not last long.

What you need to know is that the tendons around joints are like rubber bands. They stretch and contract to help us move. When someone is in late stage dementia or has another illness that causes them to spend a lot of time in bed or perhaps immobile in a WC the tendons around the  joints start to shrink and will no longer expand to allow for full movement of the joint. For example the elbow; We can normally extend or bend our arms. Contractures around the elbow cause the arm to be permanently bent getting worse over time. If one tries to straighten the elbow there will be resistance and pain. Contractures can occur anywhere there is a joint. So contractures can cause restricted movement be very painful and even add to the possibility of bed sores on the boney areas such as the elbows.       Contractures can and should be prevented. Doing this will help the person to be more mobile and avoid the pain they can cause. Prevention is simple. Performing PASSIVE range of motion on all joints gently once or twice a day can help. Here is a good youtube video explaining how to do this. There are more on youtube as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6hE_ntz4Ho As you can see it only takes 5 or 10 minutes to do this and it is done gently no force is used.       If a LO gets contractures in a NH it is most likely due to poor nursing care. Complain and demand a PT consult for range of motion exercises.   If it happens at home perhaps the caregiver has not been taught about contractures but even if it is starting doing the passive range of motion exercises can help reduce further contractures and pain.                  Selectinga home health caregiver    :          http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-screening-providers.asp                     Elderabuse and neglect    :    https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=2147519591          When You Need to Take Your LO to the Hospital     https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/going-hospital-tips-dementia-caregivers          Incontinence diaper disposal.

64,6210260511c2270d5f1e57aa,2147556544,2021-04-26 20:15:00,After the fall(1),Hi all and hope you are as well as is possible.     I’m sorry to say that my mother fell on April 17 and fractured her hip. We will not pursue surgery and she is now bed bound. Due to the pain it causes they cannot get her out of bed and only move her as is needed for care/hygiene.  Obviously it’s been very stressful and I am just now checking in here.      For background my mother is in later stage dementia (probably Alzheimer’s?) and before this fall was completely ambulatory. She is still surprisingly verbal. She is in a memory cafe unit at a facility near me. She has been on hospice since May 2020.  She had Covid last August when her facility had an outbreak.  She lost a lot of weight with Covid but otherwise recovered well. She started losing weight and falling more the past few months.  I knew eventually she would sustain an injury from a fall and well here we are.       She has lived at her facility for six years and I could not ask for better care or kinder staff.  Hospice has also been useful.    She already had a hospital bed and now has an alternating air pressure mattress thingy.  She is on morphine for the pain as well as Tylenol with codeine and/or ibuprofen. We have discontinued most of her other meds; there are a couple that we are tapering down.  Her wonderful amazing superb neurologist has had to discharge her from his care but made it clear I am to call him anytime for advice or just to talk.        She is eating (being fed which is another story) and drinking.  We placed a Foley catheter as she suddenly became unable to void her bladder which apparently can cause a lot of discomfort and distress.  A catheter comes with risks and is invasive but I felt it was more important to relieve her discomfort.       I have now gone from seeing her in person only once since March 7 2020 to seeing her nearly every day.  The facility had just opened up for scheduled half hour visits on a limited basis but immediately allowed me into the building (with no restrictions on length of visit bless them) and I now have special dispensation to visit any time day or night as often as I wish for as long as I wish and can even stay there if I want to.    So not actively dying but suddenly so much closer.      The pamphlets and such that hospice have provided me are incredibly vague and insultingly devoid of actual medical information. I have not wanted to fall down an Internet black hole so please can anyone point me towards some specific and medical information about not just actively dying and actual end-of-life but whatever it is you call what she’s doing now?     Any assistance would be gratefully appreciated.      Thank you all for listening.      (Also please feel free to ask questions or for clarification.  I’m exhausted and my brain is a sieve so I have no doubt left out important information-inadvertently I assure you!),False,Jane Smith,2015-03-23,306.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147556544,,,AlzConnected,,,

No diagnosis (didn't expect one) but she is super mad at me for forcing the issue.  When I try to acknowledge her feelings of frustration she switches gears and says ""let's not fight."" Passive aggressive behavior makes me crazy so it's grinding away at me even though I know it's a symptom of a breaking-down brain.    Follow-up testing with the neurologist is scheduled and we were told there would be a delay.  I was not expecting a  10-MONTH  delay though...she is confidently expected to be able to complete testing  NEXT MAY.      Mom's house is in contract to sell and closes in 2 weeks. Title company sent her a bunch of online login stuff for setting up wire transfers and paying off loans. I have POA (thank goodness) so I can get it all untangled but it's a pain and frustrating...wish it would just have been set up for me to handle in the first place.    Also for the home that's selling my brother's son is supposed to be mowing the lawn. This is the second time in two weeks that the agent has called to ask about mowing the property. I'm 2 states away and can't do it and my brother PROMISED it would be done last week. So now I'm frustrated about that too.    I am trying to take care of Mom's bills and I expect things to be a little more complex/a little more of a mess during this transition. However she is taking everything that is set up to be paid via online bill pay and turning it into paper payments with her checkbook.

I've had other loved ones on hospice but I was not their 24/7 caregiver. Are there signs that are universal as far as where a person is on the actively dying timeline? My mom has been on hospice since Dec. She has been been bedridden (non-ambulatory) for several weeks. I've sort of lost track. The priest has been here to give the last rites three times now as hospice was sure her time was down to hours. I've called family too many times to come and see mom before she passes as it seemed imminent. Yet here we are. Is there anything else I can do to help my mom pass peacefully. She is a skeleton at this point covered with skin. She rarely opens her eyes or responds to stimuli. I don't want to lose my mom but her suffering has gone on long enough. I don't have the heart to withhold food and water. So i suppose the few spoonfuls she gets every day is what is sustaining her? She gets haldol regularly thru the day. We have morphine but I don't give it to her regularly because she doesn't appear to be in pain. For the most part she is resting comfortably. She doesn't like to be turned or changed so she gets morphine before her bed baths. I don't like the effect morphine has on her. I don't like the way she looks when she has taken morphine. She already looks dead. If that makes sense. Maybe I just have to get over that and push the morphine to make the end come sooner? If anyone has anything to say about helping her pass or how to know how long this takes I would appreciate it. Or maybe just a little encouragement as I go thru this ordeal with her.,False,my3sons2.0,2021-05-11,11.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147557278,,,AlzConnected,,,

He started showing dementia symptoms in Sept. of 2020. We're still trying to get a diagnosis because he kept cancelling the appointment with the neurologist. We've switched everything so his phone number isn't the one they call to confirm appointments.   My dad has pre-existing mobility issues and chronic pain (used a walker for awhile but now struggles to even stand up or get to the toliet on his own). There's so much he can't do because he can't walk and the little he can do he doesn't seem to enjoy (playing cards watching tv games on the iPad).   He has lost his sense of taste and hunger and the only thing we can get him to eat is vanilla ice cream. He claims everything else tastes bad or he feels like he's full all the time. If he doesn't eat he doesn't have energy and then he can't do any of his exercises from the physical therapist. I'm losing hope that he will be able to get to the toliet on his own ever again and he will be in diapers for the rest of his life.   He's currently in a skilled nursing rehab because he stopped eating and drinking totally and ended up dehydrated and experienced delirium/hallucinations. This has happened twice now.   I guess I'm just looking for advice from people who have experience with dementia when the patient can't be distracted by things that bring them joy because they are seemingly joyless.

I've loved mom since I first knew her. She'd cry I would cry. If she was in pain I'd take it so she wouldn't have to feel it though it didn't work very well. I love mom and don't want this to be but now it is what it is.  So mom's diagnosis 2 years ago was simply ""dementia"".  I've been doing what I can to help her despite the fact that I'm physically and mentally disabled. It is so difficult for me and I'm stressed out so terrible that sometimes I don't know how much longer I can deal with mom til I finally have enough and spontaneous combust. But I have a feeling if I did it would be my last because as of this moment I don't think I can keep going.  I'm so tired and exhausted.   Not to mention that I discovered I'm experiencing a sort of Spiritual Awakening and that's stressful enough because now I feel that karma is out of order for other people yet in full working order for me.  I want to have time for myself but it seems impossible.  Mom also acts as if my very presence bothers her. She's EXTREMELY aggressive without her zoloft. She's off meds for dementia because aricept caused too bad of diarrhea the other (mem...?) caused this recent hallucination.  So now mom's had her 2nd hallucination that I'm aware of. I want to spend more time with her but she is very impatient and bitterly hateful and all she does is watch Netflix. (I'm a YT guy not exactly Netflix unless I must).  she does do laundry but it's not very good... she leaves wet clothes in dryer without turning it on I find them the next day. She also puts too much in at a time to wash and tons of other things.  Brother claims he'll help and to call if i need him but when I do he takes it allout of context and gets mad at me for god-knows-what.  I really need help and support through this and I have no one to help.    I need cervical spine surgery it's very important to get it done but I've put it off because it would be done out of town and I don't want to stress her with helping me though really it's high priority to get that surgery done because I have 2 more after that - knee which I've had surgery on both already but they said there's degenerative changes in it. Also I need overdue hernia surgery. But I don't want to burden mom...   I wish I could just be healed.  Is there anybody out there who can relate?

So Since that time I have cared for their mother. I have known for at least 10yrs something wasn’t right. She gave away at least $30000 to some scam in Jamaica. I finally had her diagnosed about 5 yrs ago. She lived next door. I fed cleaned house did laundry and such for her until about 2 years ago when doctors insisted she couldn’t live alone anymore. Her sons told me about 5 yrs ago they would come get her and take to Florida. When I felt like I couldn’t do it alone anymore...I called and asked if they found a place for her. Neither son was willing to take her in since they couldn’t get assistance unless she lived in that state for a year.  But I have managed alone.   She tried to crawl out of bed and fell and hit her head on bed rail. When she got out of hospital they ordered hospice for her. She came home a different person. 2nd day she hit me on bridge of nose and blacked both my eyes. She has since been fighting me on everything. I carry scratch and bruises on me constantly. I didn’t know because of neuropathy and diabetes..she was in pain and it hurt when I touched or moved her around in bed to prevent bed sores. A week ago she had mini stroke. Now they have her on morphine Ativan and something they put behind her ear. She is not as violent now. But it is really hard to change her or pull her up in the bed.   I love this woman just as I did my own mother. We have been friends for over 40 years. I have no regret for giving up my life to care for her alone. But now she won’t eat or drink and I am watching her fade more each day. How do u do that??? I get zero financial from her kids even though they took 23000 out of savings account. No moral support..nothing. One son calls every week or 2 and thanks me for what I do for her. The other son does gods to call every 2 or 3 months to check on her. So how do people do this alone??? I can’t afford to pay someone to help me. I have a girl that comes in 3 hours a week so I can get groceries and go to doctor appointments. I have had heart and lung surgery. Have COPD asthma thyroid issues and am bipolar and still struggle with PTSD. I feel exhausted and just a shell of a person. I spend hours in front of tv when nothing is there. I tried to get her in nursing home right b4 she fell. But no one wants to take Alzheimer’s patients after they have been placed with hospice. At this point I am just trying to be there for her so she won’t be scared or alone. I sit by her bed begging pleading crying trying to get her to take a drink or just a couple of bites of food. But am not being very successful. I thought taking care of my parents was hard (they have both passed) but caring for Alzheimer’s is whole different set of worries and stress. They say she has marbling on hands and feet. They say I should get myself prepared for this end of life stage. She is transitioning. I have read a lot but nothing prepares u for this. How can someone prepare for this??? I was comfortable taking care of her b4. But now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing. Well I have vented enough. God bless u all! Have a blessed day!

I’m just feeling so many things right now and want to share with someone who may understand. I want to share here what we are experiencing right now: if anyone in this group has a LO who has died can you give me any insight to these developments and to what stage we may be in in the dying process? I know everyone is different and there is no estimate of a persons time left on earth - but I’m wondering if I have days weeks or possibly months left of this agony of watching  someone to die  -  it’s horrible truly horrible.  Warning this post is a little graphic concerning her physical decline.  We have hospice here at home and the nurse said she believes our LO is transitioning into ‘active dying’ but is not there yet. Our LO is unresponsive unable to speak sleeps constantly (like in a coma). She has an extreme amount of sleep in her eyes. I would say every 2-3 hours I wipe out her eyes and they are FULL of goop. Her eyeballs are filmed over a really thick gel looking film.  She isn’t eating or drinking for the past few days: she’s had a few syringes of clear Ensure juice and barely got it down - can’t swallow. Shes on liquid morphine: if we touch her body at all she winces in pain.  She has a catheter and her pee is the color of coke. Her earlobes are flattened tight against her head and she has splotchy red all over her legs. I’ve read those are signs of impending death has anyone heard of or seen that before? She does not move at all she is breathing pretty regular but it’s slow long pauses between breaths.   Does this sound like the end to anyone here who is experienced?? Our nurse is a bit overly optimistic I feel like she’s very reassuring and kind but I feel like she’s a bit tight lipped regarding death. I think she doesn’t want to say “she’s dying now” or “she won’t die for a while” to protect us in a way.   I feel like we are just sitting here waiting for her to die. It’s a terrible feeling.   Can anyone give me some insight into the dying process? What happened in your experience does it get severely worse than this? Do I need to mentally prepare for worse things?   Thanks for reading this. Xo,False,kastellan,2020-04-16,24.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147556236,,,AlzConnected,,,

Diagnosis was never completely clear with 2 neurologists.  Pet Scan/CT/MRI findings: Alzheimer’s dementia and/or Parkinsonian dementia with Vascular Dementia as well.  (No evidence of FT or Lewys)  My mother does not display typical Alzheimer’s traits.  She is still mobile but has no ADLs and  she can still feed herself.  She is still cognitive to an extent.  She mostly understands what you’re asking her and can answer back sometimes. .  BUT she “babbles” (word salad) every waking moment - it never stops.  This constant babble started in December and has progressed rapidly.  She was put on Seroquel in October with no other meds.  Since the end of January my mom has been on full hospice at home.  The babble accelerated considerably a week ago - which prompted a telehealth visit with her Neurologist.  The Seroquel (75mg) works perfectly to put her to sleep at night but the daytime dosing either makes her sleep or keeps her awake and in the “babble” state.  We played with the dosing - no luck.  So the Neurologist prescribed 2 depekote (sprinkles) for day and keep the 75mg Seroquel for night.  Xanax as needed.    She has had no quieting effect with either the depekote or Xanax.  I suspect a possible UTI but she has no fever and is not complaining about any pain.  I’m hoping to get a sample (near impossible).  I also suspect she could be having this amped up babble “mania” as a side effect from the Seroquel?  Has anyone experienced this NON-STOP BABBLE?

I could not sleep. he paces at night.  I stayed there from 2 am until 10:30 AM.  I am an essential caregiver and the place is great about allowing me to come any time. I thanked the nurse for calling me but I was also upset and my husband was very upset because I have described several smaller incidents with this same nurse who is the one with the credentials.   He is under Hospice Care so they ask Hospice  to give another med--psychotropic they call it...and he is already on Trazedone and they upped the dosage recently.  I gave him a Lorazepam last night but it did not help him sleep.   He was scared of locked doors and thought people were trying to kill him.  This nurse has only done night shift twice she was filling in because they were short staffed.   My husband  spoke  to the manager...and the manager told me this would be ""dealt with"" and they were a community.    I am not sure what that means.  Partly sadly it means they are a business.    Luckily I got two good reports this evening from the daughter of his roommate and the Hospice social worker that he was happy and polite and talkative.   My dad has never been violent...he had a UTI before he went to Memory Care and he threw chairs on the floor and screamed in pain...and it took awhile to figure out what it was. We did not know if it was escalating Dimentia or pain...and he got better but never regained too much control over going to the bathroom.   The nurse did talk to me before she left...but she did not listen.  I think she is a person with knowledge but not compassion.  Or maybe she is overworked and underpaid as are all of them.  Have others experienced this?  I do not like to blame people.  It is not an easy job.  This nurse was already telling me  they are not a behavior management facility and she had to be concerned about the safety of her other residents.    I really do not know what happened.  The nurse told me she was concerned for her other residents' safety and that he had  grabbed her and called her a ******.    I live in a small area and there are not other facilities...I have been very impressed with the staff for the most part....

Judi Weaver explains why these symptoms occur and outlines some strategies to alleviate them.   Dementia is the term used to describe the symptoms of a large group of disorders which cause a progressive decline in a person’s memory intellect rationality social skills and physical functioning.  Research has reported that up to 90 per cent of people will experience one or more behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) as a result of disturbances in perception thinking mood and behaviour. Behavioural symptoms include physical aggression screaming restlessness agitation wandering socially inappropriate behaviours sexual disinhibition hoarding cursing and shadowing. Psychological symptoms include anxiety depression hallucinations and delusions. BPSD causes excessive functional and physical disability and decreases a person’s quality of life. It also significantly increases carer and staff stress.  Knowing why these symptoms exist helps us understand how to alleviate them. One way is recognising how an undamaged brain functions and what can happen if it is damaged.  The brain has four regions responsible for specific functions that determine behaviour – which includes thinking learning memory language recognition perception emotion and movement. The regions are known as the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes and include the limbic system. The brain is not an isolated organ; it interacts with all aspects of our being. It is influenced by biochemical psychological social and environmental experiences.  The frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for stopping starting planning initiating activity and regulating social behaviour. Damage to this area may result in an inability to solve problems start activities understand another’s viewpoint and empathise think logically or rationally to behave according to socially sanctioned behaviour and to regulate feeling.  The parietal lobe processes touch pressure temperature and pain. It integrates information that lets us understand ourselves in relation to the world around us. Damage to this area may result in an inability to understand pain sensations recognise and find objects orientate ourselves in the environment and coordinate movements.  The temporal lobe helps us learn memorise use language recognise and perceive phenomena. Damage to this area may cause an inability to use and understand language recognise faces and objects remember immediate short and long-term information. Damage may cause persistent talking and changed interest in sexual behaviour.  The occipital lobe converts information received from the eye and passes this information onto the parietal and temporal lobes for further use. Damage in this area can cause blindness hallucinations and an inability to see colour or motion.  The limbic system is within these lobes. Its main function is to process and regulate feelings sexual arousal and consolidate memory. Damage to this area can cause disturbance in day/night cycle changes to sexual arousal inability to control emotions increased agitation and difficulty learning new information.   BPSD: communicating feeling and need   We generally don’t think about brain function triggering behaviour. Usually we assume behaviours mean certain things based on what we have learned with in our cultural group.  For example if a person intrudes into another’s conversation we would probably think this rude and means the person is lacking social etiquette. However a person with dementia may impulsively intrude into another’s conversation because they feel scared or in pain and they are trying to get help. The person has no sense of rudeness. Brain damage may have diminished their ability to wait or reason.  Social scientists have demonstrated that innate factors – such as the need to satisfy hunger and thirst eliminate waste or repair normal bodily function – drive behaviour. Behaviour is also driven by needs to be physically and emotionally safe to experience love and a sense of belonging to sense self- worth. These needs exist whether or not a person has dementia.  Using this approach BPSD can be understood as a person’s way of communicating an unmet need. Damage to parts of the brain may diminish or distort the way the person tells us about their feelings and needs through behaviour but it always has meaning for the person. Using this approach to understand the intrusive behaviour described above we can assume intrusiveness could continue until the person senses safety and physical comfort.  Another way to understand BPSD is remembering that behaviour is triggered by stress. People with dementia have a lowered stress threshold. A person with dementia can have a catastrophic response in situations we would find tolerable. When a person experiences too much or too little stimuli the body senses danger causing the person to fight or flee for their safety.   Managing an immediate situation   When you experience a concerning BPSD you must try and enter the person’s perception of the experience to help them restore a sense of safety or hope that their need will be fulfilled. Do not try and make them experience your sense of reality (for example saying “No one has stolen your money”). You help them feel safe through behaviour and words that convey your sense of what the person is feeling (for example if a person states that their money is stolen you can say “You must feel very worried”). Next offer to help. Your intention is to lessen the distressing feeling such that they no longer need to communicate distress by continuing the behaviour. Your interpersonal relationship takes priority over completing any task or coercing the person.   Steps in problem-solving ongoing BPSD   Know the person deeply to understand how he or she experiences their world. Use these approaches for insight into any behaviour and working out the best solutions and care practice.   Firstly ask the person what is upsetting and what they think could help. Listen and action what they say.  Check for physical and medical problems that cause ill-feeling such as pain and infection illness or medication.  Check the presence of too much or insufficient stimuli.  Check what emotional experiences the person may lack which provide a sense personal comfort and wellbeing.  Find out more than you know. Ask more about what is important to the person what gave meaning in their life what have been their preferences in kinds of relationship activity and physical surroundings what experiences or situations have been hard or frightening what makes them laugh and smile and feel peaceful.  Collaboratively generate actions and experiences that are tailored to the specific personal needs and that have relevance for the person.   Antipsychotic medication is a last resort and only if there is a risk to self or others. Research shows that these medications may have dangerous side effects when a person has dementia. Also pharmacological management only has a moderate effect on vocalisations pacing repetition insomnia withdrawal thinking problems and voiding inappropriately.  Research is also indicating some non-pharmacological interventions may decrease agitation. Examples are the presence of pets music spiritual ritual scheduled reassurance physical exercise a homelike environment personally meaningful activity meaningful engagement with others and the use of ‘essential’ oils. However your relationship with the person is the most therapeutic agent for wellbeing.  A care worker is similar to a detective always looking for reasons. Consider the following:   What emotion or feeling triggered this behaviour?  What might be causing the person to feel this?  Could they have physical social or spiritual needs they are trying to tell me about?   When you find the reason you are responsible to fix it rather than blame restrain ignore or punish this person. We must change because the person cannot.  Finally if you think you might be causing distress stop what you are doing immediately. Start doing something different with the person and keep doing what helps them feel safe comfortable relaxed and happy.

My mother is 92 she has 24/7 care with caring Aides in her home. I take care of all her non-daily needs and visit her once a week. She has I'd say moderate dementia or so. She is very very articulate and verbal in the present and can have some wonderful conversations with me but can't remember much of anything that happened a few minute previously.   She also has a broken and displaced hip and has been unable to stand for close to a year. She goes from her bed to a chair. She only has pain when the leg/hip is moved and is pretty comfortable (more or less) when sitting or lying down still.   BUT she feels the need pretty much constantly to ""go to the bathroom"" and asks begs then cries constantly. She has been totally incontinent for at least 2 years. She can't remember that her hip is broken or that holding her up to stand or moving the bad leg at all causes screaming-intense pain. She thinks she can walk.  And every time (when I'm there) I tell her otherwise she's shocked falls into despair cries can't bear the news of it says ""it hurts"" she has to go to the bathroom she can't go in the diaper etc..  Eventually (I assume once she unknowingly ""goes in her diaper"") the issue resolves and she is a lovely engaged chatty person. I know she has a ""distended bladder"" so perhaps the need is real. I also know it disappears at times as suddenly as it appears. A distraction can sometimes end the terrible need/pain/crying etc... But it can go on ""i have to go"" followed by crying for hours..  She is homebound clearly. It is basically impossible to get her a doctor. In the past when she was still going in a wheelchair (impossible now it's excruciating for her) she would screech  ""get me out of here!!!"" ""they're killing me"" and so on. So it isn't easy. I talk to her doctors regularly. I cannot find one in the area to come to her home. She is a DNR. She has a multitude of other health problems: COPD diabetes CHF stage 4 kidney disease etc. She has been on and kicked off home hospice (she talks she eats she's kicked off). She can move her arms and that's about it.   I am looking for a way if possible to deal with the intense need to get up to go to the bathroom. It can go on for hours. It can start at 3:30AM etc.. Might there be a medication to calm those urges? Without side effects? I know there is the risk of a UTI but she has been like this for months and months. And how would anyone even get a urine sample? I just want her to be comfortable and suffer less. When she's NOT yelling ""take me to the bathroom I can walk I walked yesterday take me!!!"" she is content happy to be alive enjoys her meals her view out the window looking at her photos and etc.   Any thoughts re: how to deal with this? I will talk to her doctor of course but curious about personal experience.   Thank you!",False,jrkubr,2018-08-28,9.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147556595,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is in moderate to late stage she seems to know who her kids are - even though she gets us confused with each other - her short term memory is nonexistent.      Sis is really worried that Mom is in bed too much. Mom has been having physical therapy but hasn't been doing any exercises in between. So all that the physical therapy seems to be doing to making her tired we've seen no benefit! Per the therapist - if she is not going to do exercises in-between visits and especially continue after they stop coming (which is today) - there will be no benefit.      Mom will NOT do for my sis and me what she will do for the therapists - Mom still sees herself as still being our boss - we are her kids and so she refuses to do for us what she doesn't want to do. Not to be rebellious but because she it too polite to tell the therapists no! Telling us no doesn't seem to be that hard for her.   Today she is once again refusing get up (happens often these days). Her incontenance is worse - maybe because it is so hard for her to get out of bed - due to her weak legs so the leg pain makes it so that she she doesn't want. to try. She will usually get up around 3 to 4p only when it is time for her and my sis to have an evening meal (they go to a restaurant most every night). Sooooooo maybe maybe she really is staying in bed because she is bored! Who knows?!  My sister is suffering burn out - I can't do any more than I am doing. I visited with mother's visiting nurse earlier this week nurse said that it may be time for a facility - they will get her up the nurse said! They will also have activities for her to do.

That said when the nurse came and did her evaluation she stated it could be weeks-month for my mom until passing. Comfort meds are being administered as she has had long time back pain and then pain from her ankle with the recent fall/sprain. She is definitely more comfortable now.   I am just trying to process all this. There were no signs prior to her first hospitalization in October- but here we are on hospice in January/February. The hospice nurse had no doubts putting mom straight on hospice. I assume since they do this all the time- they have greater insight into symptoms and signs of end of life correct? Maybe it is because I am not ready or maybe I can’t see it- but I didn’t think she was THAT bad. But I have never been here in life before.  Perhaps it is fried and I am trying to negotiate.

I want so badly to have her here especially because she is so confused. Placing her in her time of hospice just seems so wrong to me. But I am so worn out. I don’t know what to do.

She has always experienced agitation. Of course we do all of the non pharmacological things. Quiet the room low stimulation reassurance etc and try to keep her from hurting herself or us. Really we are in our 40s and 50s and she is 77. She won’t hurt us even when she hits. It got so bad we moved her to assisted living and then memory care. She got booted from the ALF due to her agitation and behaviors. Same at memory care but they sent her to a geri patch hospital where she stayed for 11 days and had meds adjusted. Unfortunately she still struggled mightily with anger and agitation and Alzheimers of course worsened. She’s a solid stage 6. Well of course she fell and broke her hip. They repaired it surgically. She is now back living with us and my husband is retired and is staying home with her. However she has taken up a new delusion - now she LOVES him and is mad when he won’t marry her... then she turns it into she’s pregnant and is cheating on her. She calls him every bad name in the book shrieks and just won’t stop.  Of course he’s never done anything but be kind and patient with her. Then when I come home sometimes she calms right down or I have to calm her. It’s insane. I have to work. I also need to leave home to go run go to the store etc. this is all very hard now that she can’t walk is fully incontinent etc. suggestions? Also are there any meds that worked for your loved one? We always make sure she’s not hungry thirsty in pain gotta potty or consitpated... she currently takes 50 mg of Seroquel 3 x a day and is on Donepezil and Memantine. Also pls don’t think she’s just agitated at my husband because of the change from memory care to home after hip fracture - she was always in trouble for flipping out at the facility too.,False,ran2much,2018-03-09,55.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147555680,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is about to be 90. Her Alz is progressing fast. Started in March 2020 with her asking me (from her living room in Maryland) when we would be landing on our plane from London.  We are lucky to have an aide PT and thank god will be getting a night aide.  Yesterday something weird  happened. She woke up at 1PM and used her walker to get to the  bathroom all well then went back to sleep. Woke up at 4 cradling her left arm against her shoulder shrieking that her arm and shoulder were broken. We have baby monitors every where but it's possible we could have missed a fall from her bed.  Wouldn't let us touch her kept saying it was her fault because ""Daddy told me not to climb the tree and I fell out."" When I left the room she was calling for ""Daddy"" and she thought I was her mother.  Of course we went to the ER every time we went over a bump she screamed in pain. They x rayed collarbone arm wrist shoulder hand hips and did a CATscan (stroke) all normal.  By this time in the  hospital she was holding my sister's hand with the bad arm exhibiting no pain at all. Like she forgot about it.  Brought her home all well. Put her in bed. She does have terrible back pain from an old surgery so put a lidocaine patch on back.  At 2 am she woke up complaining about pain. At 3 am she woke up moaning about pain and asking for advil. I asked where it hurt and she said shoulder/arm. Feel utterly helpless and at a loss.    Has anyone ever heard about this kind of delusion before?

There were many comments when posted in 2019.   Posted:  Monday February 11 2019 10:29 PM  Sue is finally FREE. She passed away peacefully during the night. Alzheimer’s might have won in the end but I choose to remember the beautiful caring and compassionate person she always has always been.      I posted this several years ago and a final update:      2012 - Only the lonely can understand the heartache of divorce or having a loving spouse afflicted with Alzheimer’s.  Like divorce I feel the same emotions of not being able to accept the fact “why did she leave me and why doesn’t she love my anymore?”  She may be here physically but she is not the same person that I not only married 39 years ago but loved for all those many years.  She has lost her friendly smile sense of humor caring attitude and love of life.  Most of her memories are already gone.  I visit her daily at the Living Center and feel guilty as many memories are also beginning to fade.    This is definitely not what I expected of our “Golden Years”.  She took care of me and our daughter for oh so many years so I certainly didn’t mind being her Caregiver.  Luckily I was retired and able to cook clean and care for her 24/7 for over 5 years after her diagnosis of having Alzheimer’s.  Not until I was unable to properly care for her did I make the bittersweet decision to move her into a Nursing Home.  That was without a doubt the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.  War is hell.  I spent two years in Viet Nam but it was not as difficult as having to physically separate myself from the loved one with whom I had given my all.  She was never coming back.  She was staying there in that unfamiliar place alone.  Since that day we will never be the same.    I miss her loving touch her smile just being in the same room and not saying anything.  Her mere presence made me complete.  Slowly oh so slowly she left me and there was nothing either of us could do to prevent it.  She is slowly mentally reversing the aging process. Not that long ago she was no longer able to differentiate the days of the week tell the time of day and is slowly losing her ability to communicate. She even wears a diaper actually Depends.  It pains me deeply when I see her pick up a doll and play with it like a child.  I was alright for a while but now she’s gone gone but never forgotten. I am unhappy not because she is out of sight but is out of mind.  I am content knowing that I made her smile made her life complete and that makes my life worthwhile.  I realize that in her excellent physical condition that she could live many more years and easily outlive me.    I was content being a Caregiver.  I enjoyed taking care of her needs but now that she is in a Nursing Home I feel not-needed empty and alone. There has to be more to life than this. Not only did I lose my life mate and my true love but most important I lost my best friend.  Friends minister to each other nurse each other worry about each other and stand always ready to help.  Perfect friendship is rarely achieved but that we did.    The Definition of Love – “A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance”.  Love requires two loving and caring people. Unfortunately that is no longer possible.  It is difficult to comprehend how hard it is to cope with her blank stares knowing that there isn’t any recognition of whom she is staring at.     2013 - Two years have now passed since arriving at the Secure Care Facility.  She is now  unable to speak or even recognize me family or friends .  She is still able to walk but requires assistance to eat.  She is considered to be in stage 7 of A.D. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2005 and I was able to keep her at home until 2011.    2015 – She in now non ambulatory and unable to walk stand or even move her hands or feet.    Seldom addressed are the needs of the Caregiver especially after the Alzheimer’s patient is within the confines of a nursing home.  I will do anything possible for her and plan to continue to see her daily as long as we both live but cannot say for sure that I honestly love her in the true meaning of the word.  Does this make me a bad person or a realist?  I was gratified traveling through life with someone I cared for and who cared for me it made our lives complete.  It is difficult to continue without the shared affection and compassion of a caring individual.  The friendship of friends and relatives just isn’t the same.  I have learned to deal with the stress but it is difficult to cope with the loneliness. I can still remember when I visited my wife daily. Don’t do that anymore but I do visit an old friend (Her) every day. Well I have missed seeing/visiting her only 7 days in eight years.    I t is now 2019  and she has left the building to return nevermore. I pray for those of you that may have a similar future in store for you. Good luck and God bless!     It is now 2021. YES it is now two years later and a LOT of water has passed under the bridge. Both good and bad.    Within two weeks of Sue's passing i was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Yes these are our ""Golden Years"". While she was in the nursing home i started a monthly Nursing Home Family Council and was very active in the Alzheimer's Support group. Through the group I met someone that also had a spouse with Alzheimer's. He passed and I didn't see her for over two years until a unexpected meeting. We went to lunch monthly until my wife's passing. She previously had cancer also and became my Guardian Angel significant other and the love of my life. Without her I certainly wouldn't be here today.    You have no idea what a positive attitude faith and demanding an unparalleled quality of life can do for you. I have endured Chemotherapy radiation immunotherapy and surgery. I even lost my voice and Doctors said it wouldn't return they were wrong about that too luckily.    We went on a wonderful 7 day cruise with my daughter and husband. Total less than having a great quality of life was probably 6 months. I still walk about 2 miles daily over 50% of the time. I feel great and without any pain. We have also beat covid19 with flying colors with only minor side effects. Again having some issues so started Chemo again. We'll see how that works but with my attitude and faith we expect good results.    Don't ever give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel if only you look for it. You do need someone special to help you. If that person is not there now then find that person. He/She needs you as much as you need them.

On Friday they brought him and as we tried to talk to him and get him to open his eyes he would answer us but never fully wake up. This was at 10:15 in the morning.   I have tried different times of day as I know he takes naps. Sometimes I go and he is alert (at least as is possible for him.) But this has happened to me several times over the last few weeks. Despite repeated attempts from me to try and get him awake he will not wake up.   I always worry that maybe he is dehydrated or there is something else going on. After the visit on Friday they called me Saturday morning to tell me that they found him on the floor of his room at 7:30 AM. Since he is on hospice they notified the nurse but as he did not appear to be in pain they decided to monitor him.  So what should I do? And what conversation should I be having with the staff? He is starting to decline and has had a few falls in recent months.  Thank you.,False,LCW1996,2017-06-22,21.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147556017,,,AlzConnected,,,

I did the same with my husband. Our vulnerable brain compromised loved ones were removed from their prior lives and homes and somehow found solace in each other’s company believing the other is their spouse. How can we begin to understand how alone lost and abandoned they felt? After placing my husband I was and still am devastated. No doubt he with being ill and without choice was well beyond what I felt. Somehow their damaged brains compensated for their pain and connected them. Who are we to judge the rightness of their friendship stemming from their basic human need for love and belonging? They may be confused but even so legally they have basic rights as senior citizens to chose their own friends and companions.  The disease is overly cruel in and of itself a thief of our loved ones’ memories and of future hopes and dreams. I hope and pray you’ll have change of heart and leave them be to enjoy the comfort their companionship grants. By all accounts their relationship is co mutual. Studies show that such connections are good for individuals emotionally behaviorally and even cognitively.  You and I may not recognize their choices for who they once were or what they once believed as their brains have changed. Everything I’ve read on the subject says to honor their reality. They believe they are married and this gives them present purpose. In this manner I advocate for my husband and your mother. I wish them every bit of happiness peace and comfort that they can glean in their remaining days.  I will divorce my husband if it makes him legally and spiritually suitable to you as your mom’s suitor. He is a good man the best dad a proper Englishman who prides himself on manners kindness caring and respect towards others a pacifist a softie wouldn’t hurt anyone possesses a good sense of humor and finds purpose waiting on others and being helpful. He’s a dreamer free spirit and believes anything is possible.  I know nothing about your mother and I like her anyway because she sees someone to love in my husband. And my husband must identify the same in your mom.

He doesn't go to bed until sometime between 2 and 6 am and is up by 9 or 10. He had been sleeping a lot during the day but for the past 3 months he only naps an  hour or so. Since I am his only caregiver I have been getting only 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. I have difficulty sleeping in the day while he naps because of my health issues. We have tried several sleep over-the-counter remedies including melatonin and Alteril. Nothing seems to work. I am constantly exhausted and at my wits end. A relative suggested Marijuana cookies before bedtime. His wife who has auto immune disease and has difficulty sleeping due to pain has had great success with just 1/2 cookie. My concern would be how it might affect his alzs. I do intend to consult his neurologist but wondered if anyone here has tried it and what their results might be. He is already taking CBD oil for pain.

Now my question is why can't I cry his death?.  His body was taken to the mortuary an hour after his death and I immediately started cleaning up instead of crying with the other members of the family.  Am I in denial?

Her decline has been gradual but within the last few weeks she became unable to walk feed herself and get up by herself and really unable to move on her own. She recently had a light stroke about a week ago which of course exacerbated her inability to perform ADLs. She was discharged with a hospital bed wheelchair walker etc. which she did not previously have to use. Home health/PT evaluated her upon discharge to home and they recommended hospice as she has not been eating or drinking and has been very depressed and unmotivated and has been complaining of being in pain. Yesterday however she got out of bed with the assistance of her daytime caretaker and paced all day long (for at least 12 hours non-stop). She would walk (unassisted) from her recliner to the couch to a chair at her kitchen table every few seconds repeating the same words over and over- my dad (her son)'s name ""help"" ""I need to get up"" ""my back hurts"" etc. Her eyes are not focusing and she is staring off into the distance while doing this behavior. Her getting up and pacing is almost automatic like she is not aware of what she is doing. Her appearance is almost like she is ""hypnotized."" My family has contacted her physician but have not received any feedback from him yet. This behavior is so strange because she has been unable to move or get up by herself but now all of a sudden she is getting up and walking alone without help constantly. I wanted to ask other caregivers- has this happened to your loved one before? What helps calm them down? What could this behavior signal? Any feedback is appreciated.

97,6210289311c2270d5f1e6f92,2147554475,2020-10-26 11:10:00,So Scared(1),"Not sure if this is the correct location for this post but I've looked all over the net for forums dedicated to tenant concerns but I'll I've found are a zillion forums to help landlords.  This involves my mother indirectly.  If this is not the appropriate place to post moderators please move or remove if necessary.    I've lived in my apartment for nine years.  It's owned by a sole owner under an LLLP.  He owns several complexes in town and hires retired couples who wish to make some extra income as managers who live on property.  I HATE MOVING and the only reason I've moved as much as I have in the last 11 years was from having to go on disability that took my income from middle-class to below poverty level.  I couldn't have survived if Mother hadn't paid most of my bills.  Was able to get Section 8 three years ago so had hoped to stay where I am indefinitely.  I've been an excellent tenant no issues and always on good terms with the managers.  Three months ago (the same time my mother slipped out of the house -&gt; spent 10 days in psych care in the hospital -&gt;admitted to memory care) a huge oak tree directly across from my bedroom uprooted and fell on the tin roof shared by me and my neighbor Rita.  There was no storm wind rain etc.  Two days earlier we'd had a freak tornado that dumped a lot of rain on the ground but at the time the tree toppled no heavy wind.  Mid-Spring the manager said that tree would have to be removed before hurricane season because it was dead and a hurricane hazard.  The tree-fall caused Rita's living room window to completely shatter and she was temporarily rehoused in the complex model unit.  The damage to my apartment was only in the corner of the ceiling of my bedroom - the ceiling was slightly indented and plaster cracked.  It was determined that since no water could get through it was safe for me to continue living there since they had no available units plus a waiting list for apartments.  All has been well until several days ago I began wheezing when I went to bed.  I have no respiratory issues. Next morning I awoke with a hoarse dry cough.  Took temperature - normal.  Cough continued all day.  Perplexed on the cause until later in the afternoon I went into bedroom for first time that day and smelled concrete plus something ""gritty"" in the air.  Noticed a thin film of plaster dust on the nightstand directly under the tree damage.  Still couldn't figure out why that happened after three months of a lot of rain wind &amp; storms.  Next morning was having coffee with Rita (who now lives across from previous apt.) and saw a ladder leaned up to the roof.  Light bulb!  Someone was up there walking around &amp; jostled the plaster.  About then the manager arrived w/the maintenance man who went  up the ladder tore off the roof tarp and began JUMPING up &amp; down on the roof.  I went over and asked him to please stop jumping.  The manager barely glanced at me but said ""No keep jumping!!"" and laughed.  Addressing the manager again I said ""PLEASE! That jumping is causing plaster dust to fill my bedroom &amp; I've been coughing last two days."" Manager with whom I've always had a great relationship said ""I can't do anything about it; I'm just the manager; only the owner can do something."" (Not telling the maintenance man to quit jumping or ""I'm sorry I didn't realize that; we'll let the owner know."")  Manager said work was going to start on roof soon.  I asked if another apt. would be coming available in the next couple of months &amp; he said no.  I said ""Then that's going to be a problem because this plaster dust is causing a health issue as well as the on-going mold odor issues that were never properly remediated.""  Manager continued saying he couldn't do anything but would let the owner know.  Was gone the majority of the day to take step-father to a Dr. appt. went through some of Mother's things to continue taking to her as gifts when I visit returned home around 9 pm to find a note from manager on my door saying owner wished to meet with me at the office the next day to discuss ""storm damage in your apartment (there was no storm; a dead tree uprooted) your cats (uh HUH?  they are there legally) and the ""bad cat urine odor in your apartment.""  WHAT!?!?!?  I use a pine pellet litter with a LitterMaid box that causes wet pellets to dissolve and go throw the slats to the bottom box where they dry and have no odor.  My apt. was inspected three times over the late Spring-Summer: (1) 6-month inspection by former managers who were moved to another property - those managers said WOW! Your apt. is in AMAZING condition.  When I told them I'd lived here almost 9 years they were even more impressed (2) another inspection when the current managers arrived and (3) yearly inspection by Section 8 who are VERY thorough and strict. Also current manager has been in my apt. a couple of times for minor maintenance issues.  Not ONCE during those inspections nor the 9 years I've lived here has there ever been a complaint about ""cat urine odor.""  Even though the accusation is false I was scared I was going to be imminently thrown out of my apartment.  I'd told my SF the conversation earlier in the day when I saw him; called him &amp; told him about the letter.  SF had been the regional manager of several states plus PR and is an excellent salesman/negotiator.  He said tenants have rights they've accused you falsely on at least one count and he advised not meeting with them until I've spoken to an attorney and can go into meeting knowing exactly what my rights are.  He provided the name of his atty. plus suggested I contact the Legal Aid office that had been so helpful to me when Medicaid/food stamps messed up my account years ago.  I followed his advice and completed the info sheet on the Legal Aid website.  I'm to be contacted within 5 business days by someone from their office.  Called the apt. office got their answering machine and said I'd received the letter the next day was not convenient for me due to family health issues had discussed this with my SF who advised I first contact an attorney for my rights &amp; I would contact them after I had done this.  I said I was very disappointed they said there was a ""cat urine odor"" in my apt. &amp; reminded them of the inspections done the last three months.  This all set off my disability - severe anxiety.  I have not left the apt. since last Tuesday because I don't want to run into one of the managers and I need a lot of items.  I am physically shaking and to get that under control I have to take a lot of my meds which then knock me out for about 10 hours at a time at which time I wake up feed my cats and am scared again.  From reading the FL law on evictions - a lot has to go into it and again I've done nothing wrong but when anxiety kicks in reason goes out the window.  I've pondered (again - once when I was so upset about my mother) about going to the ER but if I landed in the psych ward they'd just load me up on meds I've worked 10 years to wean off plus I cannot vaccinate my 18 year old cat to board her (Another story) and can't leave her alone.  Where this involves my mother - first she is the person who could calm me help me see reason or at least be someone to talk to. (Now I wouldn't even bring something like this up.)  I have literally no one except my SF.  When I made my first (and only) appointment to see mother I asked the receptionist Gretchen what the differences were between the three types of visitation choices.  In-room was only permitted 1 visitor/week per resident.  Both the inside library visit and the outside visit where visitor is on the outside &amp; resident inside visiting through glass are unlimited.  SF wanted me to visit Mother in her apt. this week to help with some clothing issues she's voiced so he said he'd just do a couple of the library visits.  I called Gretchen last week to set that up &amp; was told SF had already scheduled a visit for the week.  I said there must be some mistake because HE is the one who wanted me have the apt. visit.  She said he's visiting in the library but ANY ""inside visit"" is only permitted per resident 1x.  That is contrary to what she told me originally.  I was so dumbfounded that I didn't recall at the time she was contradicting herself so I said I'd straighten it out with SF.  Called for 2 days &amp; he didn't call back.  When I called him the third day he was very gruff and here's his story:  He went last Friday for a library meeting with Mother &amp; was told by Gretchen someone else had that time.  SF makes his next appt. as he leaves the current one and said he'd set that up the former week.  Unbeknownst to SF the new Memory Care Director Brooke (who he'd never met) was standing in the background. Gretchen kept telling him he was mistaken SF said he ALWAYS visits at that particular time.  Gretchen told him to sit down &amp; if the other visitor didn't show up then he could see Mother.  SF waited but other visitor did show up.  SF said this was obviously a mistake on her part (SF really is good about not forgetting appointments etc.) and if he was going to begin having issues seeing his wife he was going to have to look for another facility.  I don't know if it was Gretchen or Brooke but somehow they took SF to the huge room that one enters prior to the library and sat up chairs so Harry did get to visit with Mother.  Brooke introduced herself to SF apologized for the mix-up and said this would never happen again.  I got the impression that Gretchen was ""spoken to.""  Harry said he was going to see Mother again today (Monday) but he'd also heard the staff there were having a meeting because our Governor has taken another step in relaxing nursing home/facility visits to include being able to take residents home for overnight visits (I doubt that includes MC &amp; SF &amp; I have agreed that's not a good idea for Mother as she'd want to stay) BUT sounds like we may be able to take her out for drives.  Outside visit with more visitors involved are now being included so that's all good news.    Harry said he'd find out what changes if any had been made when he goes today AND get the deal straightened out on the conflict of what Gretchen had told me.  There's another facility near us that was formerly a home that only keeps nine memory care patients at a time; this facility has 150.  He plans on visiting the other facility and moving Mother if needed.  What he doesn't know that I do from being a Hospice counselor is that sometimes the small facilities is a single person who has set up their home as a nursing home and often don't have the facilities staff Dr's etc. available.  I've seen some of those.  Back to my apt./fear/anxiety - when I was speaking to Harry I voiced again how scared I was and he said ""I don't have time to listen to this.""  I said this is what I missed so  much...not being able to talk to my Mommy...and started crying.  He said ""I can't listen to this and hung up.""  I lost it and the realization that I TRULY have NO ONE ON EARTH to help/listen to me set in.  If I didn't have my beloved cats I definitely would have headed to the ER.  I'm NOT suicidal but I wouldn't be in any more pain now if my mother was dead because she is ""gone to me"" in the ways I need her. I pray every night that I will just die in my sleep.  I can't afford counseling; I told my Dr. at my last visit the pain I was in due to Mother's accusations of me due to her delusions &amp; being admitted to MC and was there ANY med or supplement that could help temporarily.  She told me I was already on everything she would normally recommend.  I've called the county mental health agency and get the run-around on counseling there.    My main question is:  Does anyone have any similar experience with a landlord or ANY INFO that can help me calm down while waiting for the attorney to call?  Now I can't even talk to my SF.  I'm terrified I'll have no place to live.  Apartments in this town that used to be reasonable are now going sky-high because we're one of the towns that people fleeing the cities are coming.  Then I have Section 8 to consider and I absolutely cannot lose that.  On TOP of everything SF's daughter was arrived Saturday bringing....his new Bichon Frise puppy!!!!  He'd been trying to adopt another Bichon after they lost their little guy who was my mother's joy for months but once Covid hit the Bichon rescue where they'd gotten their past two Bichons was closed and regularly checking with the Humane Society isn't his thing.  His daughter located a Bichon breeder in Georgia Harry called breeder &amp; put down a deposit on a litter delivered close to November as he wanted the puppy to be a surprise for my mother since they lost their dog Thanksgiving night last year.  Mother had not wanted to get another dog when the one they lost two dogs ago died but Harry complained so much that mother gave in and of course she was the one who took total care of him. He eventually developed diabetes - they took SUCH good care of him giving him insulin 2x/day then  he lost his sight but was still such a happy little dog and glued to my mother.  Even with her diminishing memory she took care of him.  I've seen her on her hands &amp; knees cleaning up a ""poop accident"" with only one Kleenex before Harry say it and ""yelled at the dog.""     The night he died at her feet was a nightmare.  With mother so ill it never dawned on me Harry would get another dog but that was before mother had to go to MC.  NOW the puppy (currently 3-mo. old) is to keep him company.  I understand that but for an 89 yo man with multiple health issues to take on a puppy is imo not wise.  I asked if he'd ever raised a puppy; he hasn't but ""I ordered a book on it and know all about it.""  He has no idea what he's getting into.  I've had one puppy in my life and as much as I love animals I will NEVER get another puppy.  It took close to 3 years for mine (a Samoyed Huskey) to outgrow puppyhood quit chewing on EVERYTHING (including furniture) etc.  Plus Harry walks verrrrrrrry slowly with a cane.  Thank you so much who took the time to read this.  Time to take more meds and knock myself out.",False,SonShine Lady,2020-08-09,77.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554475,,,AlzConnected,,,

Anyone Experienced This?,"As background: I am 66 single (divorced over 20 years ago and never re-married) no children and my mother's only child thus no siblings.  My mother is the dearest person on earth to me and was always my rock and ""the calming voice in the night"" when I was in a deep depression. I was diagnosed over 30 years ago with major depression recurrent rapid-cycling.  18 years later I was diagnosed with major anxiety place on a hideous benzo with no advised consent ie. when I was well enough to research the new med discovered it is extremely addictive and advised by same Dr. to apply for disability that drastically changed my lifestyle/finances.  Over the years I fired that Dr. and currently have a wonderful Dr. who has significantly weaned me down from the Benzo got me off approximately three anti-depressants replacing them with one newer med with far less side effects.    As my mother got older my greatest fear was losing her - her company my best friend our almost daily three-hour talks on the phone.  What I NEVER imagined was her becoming ill with Alzheimers. Until recently she and my now 89-year-old step-father (SF) lived in their own home with me about three miles away.  Fast forward as I've discussed Mother's illness and ramifications in other posts.  Due to her getting out of the house resulting in being placed by law into PsychMed at a hospital for 10 days and most frustrating from Day 1 refusing to take her medications that would have provided so much relief and the medication non-compliance spread to not taking her BP meds resulting in several visits to the ER over 36 hours we knew she was no longer safe at home and my SF was frazzled to a thread.  Mother was also experiencing major visual and auditory hallucinations paranoia and delusions including locking herself in her bedroom and screaming when we tried to coax her out.  The worst for me was accusing my SF and I of having an affair.  Over the past number of years she has accused my SF of affairs with a house cleaner and two sisters-in-law who live in another state.  At one point Mother asked me ""to keep an eye on my SF"" since I took him to some Dr. appointments.  I assured her that to the best of my knowledge SF was DEFINITELY NOT having an affair with anyone and was doing his best to care for her.  Thus when my mother was found wandering by a police officer who point-blank asked my SF if he was having an affair with me based on what Mother told the officer....I was speechless to say the least.  We found a lovely Senior Living Facility that includes a locked memory care unit and Mother was admitted on September 9.  My step-sister who lives in another city took her as neither my SF nor I could stop crying long enough to do so.  Based on subsequent visits to her apartment by my step-sister and two by my SF Mother seems to be doing well - has gained weight (she had gone to literal skeletal level) eating well likes her room and has had positive visits with each of them.  SF mentioned I'd be visiting soon and received no reply.  He was relieved when he left that she didn't ask to go home - one of his major concerns that would have torn him up.  During the past two years of never knowing when I'd be called in the middle of the night taking Mother to many of her Dr. visits medical tests and consultations many of which necessitated I dressed her as she was very confused although extremely worried I must have been running on adrenaline. I  am  relieved that Mother is safe eating more nutritious food taking her meds on schedule etc. but out-of-the-blue I've fallen into a depression worse than I've had for years.  I think the main trigger is my mother's delusional thinking about an affair; even when I saw her for the last time at home when urged by my SF she had agreed for me to visit her Mother's attitude toward me was ""frosty.""  I was formerly the person she confided in when she was upset with everyone else including my SF.  I don't want to visit her until I'm in a better frame of mind and if she's still in that delusion or her memory is so gone that she actually believes that...I don't know how I'd react.  For the majority of September I have slept approximately 20 hours/day; showered maybe once gone out of the house maybe twice to a near-by Walgreens when my cats ran out of food and/or I needed food but had no energy to go to the main grocery.  I'm barely eating a meal a day - I mainly eat peanut butter &amp; crackers 1 frozen dinner/day if I have it (have run out last two days) the last of the cans of salmon I had in my ""prep"" supplies.  I'm truly not hungry though just very weak and getting showered dressed and leaving the house is too overwhelming.  The worst pain is when I wake up and start uncontrollably crying ""I've lost my Mother...I need my Mother!!"" eat whatever there is take my meds and return to bed for another 20 hours.  My SF doesn't understand depression but has offered to come feed my two cats if I want to go to the ER.  I really don't want to do that - there's not much they can do for me or any med I haven't been on for the past 30 years and I don't want to be loaded up with meds all over again.  If I was admitted more than a couple of days the litter boxes would be an issue and my step-father has never dealt with that.  I had my regular appointment with my Dr. a few days after Mother was admitted - told her all that had transpired with Mother since my last visit  that I could feel I was slipping into a depression and asked/begged if there was anything I could take short-term or another supplement that would help.  She said I was already on everything she would recommend including calming supplements with GABA L-Theanine 5HTP etc.  I am very pleased with the care I receive from this Dr. but like many medical offices these days the only way I can communicate with them is via the ""Patient Portal"" which a tech reads &amp; I'm not even sure the message gets to my Dr.  The response would be ""Go to an ER if you need help.""  I've tried contacting our community mental health agency for low-cost counseling and have gotten a complete run-a-round there.  My SF seems to be doing fine - probably a relief from the two+ years of caring for her 24/7.  His daughter is moving into town to help him and they've communicated more than they have in years.  He's co-ordinated moving some of my mother's favorite furniture into her apartment including buying a small refrigerator taking snacks to her etc.  He's been amazing and feeling like I'm letting him &amp; Mother down adds to the guilt/depression.

No other person visits or helps me.  I do this alone.  Today the eye doctor told my father he was no longer allowed to drive.  He lives alone and Im there to help him. I dont live there but close by.  I also watch my grandkids on a daily basis and work a full time job.  Today he siad I set this whole thing up to get him to stop driving and all of his grandkids were in on it also so they dont lose their inheritance from being sued by him having a wreck and hurting someone.  This happens every time we go to the doctors or some where he has to have check ups. Afterwards he said he was contimplating suicide because he now has nothing left. This isnt the first time hes said this.  I dont tell any of the family his diagnosis because they simply never call to ask how hes doing or come to see him.  Every time  I do something for him he immediately finds a way to make it my fault and then I feel like I shouldnt have even attempted this because the outcome is always the same.  Its my fault for his pain no social life not being able to move around etc.  It doesnt end and I feel burned out. I read alot of posts here tonight and I feel alot better. Im going to keep reading.  He calls me 10 to 20 times a day...I always answer and sometimes 3 times while Im sleeping.  I need a break..I know that but theres just no one else to help.  Now I feel like Im just whining and I feel guilty all the time.,False,Tammy S,2020-11-04,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554574,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mine is really long but I needed to get it out.    My name is Kristin. I am 27 and have been affected by ALZ since I was a kid. It has always triggered something in me to feel a deep sadness. Lost time and forgetting my life and loved ones is my greatest fear.   I needed to move out of my hometown to begin living my life for myself 3 years ago. I was living in my Dad's house alone the one he built on land my Grandpa gave him and had been since I was 17. My Mom moved out when I was 12 and I quickly became the one who had to make the house a home. My Dad moved in gradually with his girlfriend full-time without ever really talking about it with me. Soon I was alone there and hadn't even graduated high school. Fast forward to age 22 and it is falling apart. I felt this burden to take care of my childhood home and for years it consumed me. It took a lot of preparation for me to leave but I finally managed to escape and move 2200 miles away. And that's how it still feels... like I escaped that house and my hometown.  My paternal Grandma was diagnosed with dementia 6 years ago. I feel extreme guilt and like I'm missing out on time spent with her. I was also one of the only people that went to see her. I worry about how lonely she must be and how selfish I feel for moving away. I try to justify it by saying it should be my dad aunt and uncle feeling this guilt and I will soon be the one in their shoes with my parents but I'm not sure if it helps me feel better or worse.   I feel guilt for her being alive and alone... and I also feel like I've been grieving her life for 6 years as if she were already gone due to the dementia. I miss her either way. Here is my story.   My Grandma who I am very close to was unexpectedly put in a nursing home in 2014 at age 73 after a back surgery left her immobile. Before the surgery she was healthy and active with a normal amount of memory loss for her age (i.e. telling me the same story twice on the phone when I called). Paired with crippling neuropathy pain in her feet she soon couldn't walk and care for herself and had to remain at the care facility.     Dad tried to bring her home for a bit but her house didn't have handicap accessibility and didn't have the funds for in-home care. I would often come to her house to find her on the floor or sitting in wet pants because she couldn't make it to the bathroom. But she wanted to be home so badly that she wouldn't ask for help in fear she'd have to go back to the nursing home. So she'd just lay on the floor until someone found her or sit in her poop until someone came over to help clean. My Grandpa and Dad had no option but to take her back however it was not handled in the best way.     No one sat her down to explain why and to this day she is confused and wants to go home she won't participate in any activities at the home or leave her room. She argues with her roommates and is rude to the nursing staff (who honestly have the hardest job ever). She isn't allowed to have a cell phone now because she just dials numbers and asks them to come pick her up. Now I can't call her unless my dad figures out a way to get a one-way phone in her room though SS.   But he isn't the most diligent when it comes to getting my grandma the things she needs and he doesn't visit her much. I think it's too hard for him due to a lot of family drama I won't say here. There is a lot of unspoken trauma from my grandparents with him and with me as well. I still love them and want them to be safe.    I love my dad he is 61 and already shows signs of memory loss and deals with the genetic neuropathy pain too. I worry very much for the future and I've sadly already begun 'grieving' and soaking in as much as I can (not the healthiest I know). I do wish he could have gotten some healing done with my grandma before the dementia.    My grandma is a very proud woman the strongest woman I know and it was so so hard to see her dignity stripped away in such an abrupt way. Before all of this she worked very hard as a senior caregiver when she was in pain herself... cleaning cooking shopping doing laundry and being a friend to 10 or so seniors in an assisted living community 30 minutes from home. I grew up going with her to the facility every day in the summers while my parents worked. It's where I learned to do all of these things myself and most importantly where I gained my oversized capacity for empathy (something I feel both blessed and cursed with thanks to Grandma). We shared a lot of time together at the facility. She just taught me so much about life.  She also made       me promise on numerous occasions as a kid and teen that I would never let her end up in a nursing home.  I remember one time very vividly where we were driving the weather the smell of her boat of a car as we went over the railroad tracks on our way into town.    The dementia accelerated so fast after she was brought back in. She remembers who I am but her timelines are all jumbled up. She still has memories so vivid but they now take place as her present. I usually entertain whatever memory she's in since I would rather listen to her speak confidently rather than correct her over and over. It's like we are playing pretend together as children and it feels so nice to get my grandma back for a little bit. I really miss calling her and just chatting for hours.     Since I was a kid I have been afraid of Alzheimers; lost time lost memory forgetting my life and my loved ones. Being alone in a dark and smelly place confused.    All of a sudden she was in my worst nightmare with no warning no mental preparation no proper communication nothing. I don't remember the last time we cooked a pie together I don't remember the last time she wished me a happy birthday when I hugged her standing up. I don't remember the last time she laughed in the present or told a joke. I didn't know I needed to engrain those moments in my mind at the time. She was healthy. And then she wasn't.     A promise I made her so many times was broken. I'd never let her end up there. I'd take care of her. She'd move in with me; she always asked if she could. It's like she knew no one else would be there for her... and I feel an extreme amount of guilt now for it. It seeps into my everyday life and I worry about how it will affect me for the rest of my life. I have a crippling fear of time and its the root cause of my anxiety.    I am scheduled to talk with a therapist but wanted to share my story with others like me too. I think it helps to write it out.

About a month or so ago my Mom started sleeping later in the day. Sometimes 2 or 3 in the afternoon. My sis her full-time companion tells me that Mom seems to be sleeping at night (it's hard to tell really since my sis needs sleep too and may be missing whether Mom is asleep or not - there are no real signs that she is not sleeping).   Mom doesn't snore - so we are pretty sure her sleeping more is not due to sleep apnea.  Apparently my mom had gotten up by mid morning today but was taking a snooze in her recliner by mid afternoon. Mom hadn't been sleeping very long when my sis noticed that Mom was in a trans/sleep like state. Sis said the her eyes were closed but that she was talking really mumbling - loudly - but that she was not making any sense. Sis said it had been going on for about a half hour when she finally decided to call me. She stepped away just far enough from my mother to call and tell me what was going on when all of the sudden my mother started yelling ""help me!!"" She yelled 'help me' several more times - it sounded as if she was in pain or very frightened.   My sister immediately went to her I could hear their interaction. My mother soon became anger and started yelling at my sister to leave her 'the hell alone'! I was on speaker and said to my sis does she need to go to the hospital? That upset her even more (she hates hospitals) she then told us both to go to hell!  Then she wanted my father - he died 13 years ago. She kept asking where he was.   Probably being a little slow on the take I finally decided that she had probably had a nightmare. A very bad nightmare.   I drove over to check on her and to give them both support. By the time I got there - Mom was calm and didn't remember any of the episode. She seems puzzled when we told her that she had had a nightmare.  This may be an isolated incident - but I've now read enough to know that nightmares can be caused by dementia or medicine used by dementia patients.   I will be contacting her doctor Monday - should I call her PCP or neurologist?   What do I need to watch for what can I do?!   This is totally new to us - as I said perhaps it will never happen again - but I want to get Mom the help she might need and to be prepared to do what we can do if this is a new continuing issue.   Saya_G",False,Saya_G,2017-07-08,125.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554678,,,AlzConnected,,,

I moved her the following year and during the moving process  the letter carrier met me at the mailbox and asked about her change of address form (another story for another time).  when she realized that mom had dementia she said to me ""seven years"" with heartfelt pain in her voice and on her face.  And then she advised me to not ever let mom get her mail anymore.  Which I made sure to do.  But  I'll never forget it.  Seven years was the period it took for her own mom to die of dementia.  Mom died this past July just four months shy of seven years after I moved her.    It is said that there are many angels on your shoulder along the journey in life.  Some you will see and others are less obvious.  The letter carrier was one such angel.      And so her birthday just passed and it was a hard one.  You see with Covid we have not yet had her funeral. The grave where she will be placed next to dad is 300 miles away from here.   Hoping that somehow this can happen in the late Spring.  Our family is spread out around the country so we have not even met to hug or cry together.   So the pics of her party from Shutterfly brought home just how much we need to be together again and celebrate mom.      Stay safe all!  Happy Thanksgiving!  Wishing you all some angels during this time.",False,Abuela,2012-06-24,605.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554746,,,AlzConnected,,,

It took me a great deal of therapy to deal with it. She is a narcissist and probably borderline personality. She has NO friends and has driven away everyone who ever met her with her nasty and strange behaviour. She has had a billion reminders that SHE is the problem but no it's everyone else who is the problem. So she's alone.   She did not speak to me for three years after my serious cancer diagnosis. She really never refers to my cancer -- I still have it it cannot be cured and it will cause my death -- but last week she called in the middle of the night to ask me to share my ""cancer pills"" with her and said she was in great pain. I didn't want to give her prescription pain pills and said I would come over now if she wanted. I did not have the intention to give her pills but to check in. I don't share RX and she is an alcoholic and I don't want her mixing drugs with whiskey. She is in a senior apartment not assisted. She said no but told me to bring them in the afternoon. Early in the morning I got a call she had been taken to the hospital. Turns out she called 911.   Despite my repeated requests at the home where she lives they took her to a hospital where her doctor is not affiliated because ""it looked critical."" It was a LOT of work connecting the dots and getting her doctor connected with her care. I am still not sure any entity is speaking with any other or addressing her issues. It seems to be a raging UTI one of many she has had. She was delusional and violently angry with me. We are having a COVID surge and I have no immune system but I visited her in the hospital and she raged and was nasty and brought up some of her rages about me from my childhood. I am a loser there's something WRONG WITH ME -- that's how she used to talk to me and started again. While I'm risking COVID to see her.   I got her transferred to rehab so (1) she could be away from COVID (2) she could get PT and potentially get back to her apartment and (3) because she was under observation and her insurance does not cover that. THIS TOOK TO MUCH DOING. I packed a bag and brought it to the rehab.   She is still raging at me eight days later. She was convinced I checked her into ""a home"" and let her friends have all her possessions. She insults me through the roof every time we speak and complains about her pain. I keep telling her to tell the nurses. She says no one is there and I'm like Mom you saw the doctor yesterday. She screams at me that I am a liar. I say that she can't talk to me like that and she sighs and says ""this is what was always wrong with you."" My family just sees me as a dog to be beaten. That is my role. I cannot get out of that role. If I stand up for myself I am ""doing that thing you do"" and I get silence. She hung up on me because my family does not allow me to stand up for myself.   I am waiting for a call from her doctor her PCP so I can describe her ""excruciating back pain"" and maybe once and for all we can get a diagnosis. i went to her PCP with her in September and November and she was supposed to make follow up by getting a neuro scan an EKG and seeing her urologist but she canceled all of the appointments.   I need her to get a diagnosis. She has undiagnosed dementia a UTI that's raging BUT that the hospital sent in an RX for to her HOME and not the rehab facility so it's waiting there. She is a nasty person who hates me and has no problem insulting me down to the ground on a GOOD day.   I hate this.   Her former money manager checked in with me to get her email address and I gave him her number at the rehab place.

We have tried meds like Celexa and the like but none of these seemed to help his condition.  In fact they seemed to have the opposite effect of what was desired.   Bottom line is has or have a person you cared for been on Seroquel and Depakote (Valproic Acid) at the same time.  Did you find this combo helpful or were there bad results from it?    I need to know what I am up against if we go ahead with this medication.  I know everyone has different reactions to medications but I would like to get a general idea how helpful these two meds are when taking them together each day.  Thank you.,False,KatieKat1,2020-04-30,79.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554905,,,AlzConnected,,,

I know she is in the end stages and I know it looks likely very likely that extremely soon she is going to die. I already called a priest to give the anointing of the sick or last rites.

To help mom get things squared away see what things we need to do ect.  Dad doesn't remember my kids not even sure he remembers me. He's non-verbal now he's wearing depends  he's skinny as a bean pole - He had 2 stents put in last year and the doctor I guess decided not to do the rest. Dad had  a heart attack a yr ago Aug.  Mom keeps me updated frequently (daily!) He's fallen 3x gonna see if I can track down a Wheelchair for himprobably thru the VA. VA gave him a walker but he doesn't understand how to use it even though mom showed him each time. She takes care of his bathing needs  she got him  crew cut cause he didn't wash or take care of his hair he's at that point now. Not able to tend to his own needs. I went down on Sept 10th with my daughter and family and from that point to current  he seems to be declining faster . Mom agrees.   It saddens me deeply but I'm a tough cookie. Chronic pain and Congenital problems doesn't stop me from helping my parents out. They live 4 hrs from me that's hard too. But we make the best of what we got . My dad was a firefighter EMT when I was a child he was a Safety Engineer over in Libya before problems rose up over there. It was an Oil rig camp and he kept people safe treated them ect.   He fished  taught me how to clean fish and I got good too we would race to see who'd get their fish cleaned  and I could beat him every time lol.  I am his daughter and used to be his shadow. I climbed on fire trucks oil rigs  whenever he'd go for whatever purpose besides just work. He was  serious at times funny loving... now he's this...Shell of a person my dad but yet feels like he's not.  Always thought it was very Cool that His Birthday is Jan 13th and mine is Jan 31st.

I have watched the last 5-7 years as my mother has slowly gone downhill.  I have recognized personality changes early on and now it has progressed to much more forgetfulness and confusion.  My aunt her sister was diagnosed with alzheimers just over 2 years ago and is no longer responsive or verbal on video calls.  I am afraid my mother is headed that way.  My father is a retired physician and he is resisting the idea of having a formal diagnosis because he doesn't think it will change anything.  He thinks that because he was a doctor he can handle all of this on his own.  But he can't - the stress is obviously getting to him and he has lashed out at me over very simple things to the point where there is little to no communication with him.  And most recently my mother sent an email to my sister and I and my sister replied to both of us.  My mother replied to that email not realizing that it was ""reply all"" and in it said horrible ugly mean things about me and my relationship with my children.  None of which was true btw she is seeing things that just aren't there.  I am now feeling so broken and I just don't know what to do.  I feel as though my mother has already died.  The woman inhabiting her earthly body is no longer my mother.  And to make matters worse my mother in law passed away in June and I see the pain on my husband's face when I am dealing with this because to him I still have a mother and he doesn't.    So how do you let go of the person who raised you and come to terms with the person that the disease has left behind?  I'm just lost.

I have been worried and hesitant about phoning her as I do not want to add to her anxiety and 'episodes' of not wanting to be there.  But I also want her to know I love and miss her and I don't like that she thinks we just dumped her there....been wrenching on my heart.  And my heart does not always agree with my brain.   SO tomorrow I am attempting a ZOOM call with her.  We will see what happens.  This all is so difficult as I know this is the safest place and most stimulating environment for her.  She has had uncontrolled diabetes (because she was forgetting her meds as well as not eating well or at all...she would forget) and we were not able to have 24/7 care at her home (another guilt point for me).  I wish we could have done that but again there was truly not much interaction or stimulation other than a few words she did give to the caregiver or me (I moved in for a few months) and the TV.  I do know the MC is the best thing for her - but I still feel horrible because in her mind we dumped her there.

Because of the lock-down I wasn't able to see the room my mom would move into nor go in with her to make sure she was set up properly.  This situation caused a lot of grief for my mom for myself and for the administrative staff as I had to complain about many things. I've already posted a comment in another feed as to my experience in moving my mom into a MCF.  My mom is extremely high maintenance and wants attention 24/7 even with minimal stuff.  I believe she's not as helpless as she intends everyone to believe because she used to tell me when taking care of her that she was very spoiled and loved the attention and to be pampered.  My mom has delusions and paranoia as well sometimes worse than others so it makes it very difficult to know how much truth there is in what she says.  Not being able to enter the facility and see for myself made things so much more stressful for everybody.  The head nurse called me after a fall that my mom faked (maybe a delusion?) to tell me my mom was manipulating me and it was very normal behavior for new residents. A second time my mom has mentioned a fall but then I was able to visit her the next day as essential caregiver as restrictions due to the pandemic are changing currently.  I checked on her and again there were no bruises swelling pain or discomfort.  I'm thinking that it might be a speech issue as my mom already has trouble finding the right words to express herself and maybe she means she lost balance and leaned onto something without hurting herself.  Last Friday while I was still ""on vacation"" from mom's calls and messages I received messages from a cousin that took the burden of calling my mom everyday to listen to her complaints so I could take time off and regain my center.  She said my mom had had diarrhea for 3 days.  I contacted the MCF and the head nurse told me my mom had complained the day before (Thursday) from loose stools and they had given her some medication and my mom had denied having more loose stools the next day (on Friday the day I was contacting them.)  So I very confidently contacted my cousin to tell her this and she said that was a lie because she had talked to my mom also on Wednesday and when my mom told her she had diarrhea she talked to one of the aides that told her they were going to address the problem and give her something for that.  So my mom started having loose stools on Wednesday but the head nurse told me it was on Thursday and my mom didn't have them any more on Friday while my cousin is telling me my mom still is complaining of loose stools on Friday.  My cousin would have no reason whatsoever to lie so then I have to believe that the head nurse is lying to me.  Is this even possible?

My Dad has lived alone since.  It was not ideal but my sister and I made sure someone checked in 5 to 7 days per week.  We knew he needed a new living situation but he was resistant and we didn't want to pull him from his home so soon after Mom died.  About one month ago he stared calling us in the morning telling us he needed to go to the hospital.  He said he was in a lot of pain and couldnt get out of bed.  We would try to get to the house and get him situated and as the day wore on he became his old self.   About two weeks ago he called 911 and went to the hospital (my sister and I work and didnt get his call ).  In his defense he was having problems with a swollen hand but they sent him home to see his primary.  His behavior continued with him telling us he needed to be in the icu and in the evening he was fine.  He would complain about pain all over.  Clearly his hand was hurting but we dont know about the rest. Eventually about eight days ago he called 911 again.  This time they admitted him based on faulty blood work that showed pancreatitis.  From Friday when they admitted him to Sunday he went from totally caring for himself to not being able to feed himself speak clearly or use his arms.   He was discharged to rehab and had to be transported on a stretcher.  We are hoping he gets back to his baseline so he can go to assisted living or even memory care rather than skilled nursing.  He has a dementia diagnosis. What happened?  Is it trauma that caused this downturn?  We have no received no medical explanation (ie stroke).  Can he bounce back?  Of course he has to quarantine so we can't see him.  The staff seems very kind but they also seem baffled.    I hope you may have some explanation.   Thank you!,False,Dee Lynn,2020-10-10,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147554298,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's been a roller coaster. We knew she would be very mad at us but somehow it has been worse than we imagined. We're struggling with how to handle her. Mostly we are limiting our contact since her children seem to cause agitation.   Like many of the posts on here we are dealing with anger and lashing out. She tells me she is so disappointed in me. That she thought I was her friend and if I loved her I would never have done this to her.   Two days ago I had a strange but decent telephone call with her. She thinks she has been kidnapped and she wanted to give me information to help find her. I used that as an opportunity to join her in her reality and to ask questions about her life now. When she talked about meeting this group of ""fair"" people it turned out they were performers like ones who go to traveling ""fairs"".  I was able to ask about food there that she likes.  I asked her if she was being threatened or harmed and she said no. Everyone was being very kind to her. So I focused on that getting her to admit that she's not in immediate danger. She was not in physical pain in any way.   I still struggle with how to handle direct questions. I dodge them as best as I can. We're told to honor the emotion and I try to do that. As children my mother's one rule was never to lie to her. Lying was the worst thing we could do. So fiblets don't come easily. Rationally I know that avoiding the truth is a kindness but I still have trouble sometimes.   When she says ""When are you coming to get me?"" or ""Why did you do this to me?"" I have fumbled the response. We agreed as a family on saying it was on the advice of her doctors to keep her safe.I have tried mirroring her ""I understand you're saying you would like to go home.""    When she talks about being kidnapped I don't agree or disagree with that. I don't want to acknowledge that negative part of her reality. Although when she asked if I have gotten a ransom request I just said no and tried to change the subject.

Looking at the description of stages she would be 7(e) and has been for a while.    She is almost completely bedridden. Can barely hold up head if placed in wheelchair. Mostly in a semi vegetative state. Has had positive primitive reflexes for years.(Babinski and sucking.)   She's been on hospice for 18 months and recently began sleeping more  according to staff and hospice nurse reports.   She has recurring UTIs but other than that the only change she's had in about a year other than substantial weight loss. She eats well but is under 80 pounds. No fat or muscle left.  I'm hoping that she's not in pain and that she's as comfortable as she can be.  She is treated with antibiotics when they suspect UTI.   I'm feeling very anxious about things. How long can a person survive this way?  I speak with the hospice social worker and chaplain weekly but they just don't know. So many residents who were in much better condition that she was on her wing have passed away since she entered the MC.  Plus she has diabetes hypertension arthritis GERD and osteopetroses. All meds stopped except those for comfort.    Did an increase in sleeping seem to indicate the end was near?   I realize that refusing food is a major indicator but honestly I'm not sure we'll ever see that with her.

This was a sudden change.   Later that same day I had another call to let me know that two residents from her memory unit who had both gone to the hospital tested positive for Covid at the hospital.     The entire building was tested. On Thursday her Covid test came back positive along with seven other residents on memory care one staff member from memory care and i don’t know about AL.      She has had no fever or cough and her lungs sound clear. A chest X-ray Sunday night was clear.  Labs unremarkable and they were not able to get a urine sample. She already has orthostatic hypotension and that is worse than usual. Her appetite is fluctuating. She is weak and not getting out of bed. Her O2 sats are running low even with oxygen (not higher than 88) and there is occasional shortness of breath. She is in no apparent pain or distress other than the occasional shortness of breath.       Her facility has converted part of the building into a Covid unit with dedicated staff.  Of course families can choose to send someone to the hospital if they wish but I’ve elected to keep her there comfort care only.  She has been on hospice since the end of May.    These are the first residents at this facility to test positive for Covid and while I knew it was inevitable it is still a shock.  I’m fortunate that the facility has good leadership and staff they communicate well and I know and trust them. Of course I have not been inside since they locked down in early March but I did have an outdoor visit with my mother in July.     I have one very specific question for our medical professionals and those with hospice experience please. My mother has experienced some low oxygen saturation levels this past week and some shortness of breath. I ordered PRN oxygen to be used at the staff’s discretion if it would alleviate her distress. Hospice did not like this and told me “we don’t do oxygen for hospice patients.”  Is the use of oxygen (nasal cannula) generally contraindicated for all hospice patients?  Would that vary by hospice company policy?  And would that policy be reconsidered in light of Covid?  Or did this particular hospice person just not know what they were talking about?  I don’t want to do anything to cause distress and I want to relieve as much suffering as possible and can’t see the harm from the nasal cannula (yes I checked and she tolerates it) but if I’m wrong please let me know.     Thank you all so much.,False,Jane Smith,2015-03-23,306.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147553702,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her last few IVs were made comfortable by a topical pain reliever I finally realized I could request.  I wish I had requested such a thing much earlier in her illnesses.  It made a huge difference in her comfort and peace of mind.  It occurs to me that topical pain relievers might help with other procedures as well.  I think hospital folk are so accustomed to starting IVs without preparation that it never crossed their minds to make it more comfortable for someone who couldn't understand why they were digging a needle into their arm.

I would visit often and try to move through this horrid process in a different way. That's all changed. I dont even know what to expect. We can only afford state run facilities and concerned about the care or lack thereof with the negative stories from the workers and clients at my moms adult care center. I know everyone isnt bad but I cant see her regularly and have to depend on others to care for her knowing that no one will love and care for her as I would. I have a sister that is almost 9 months pregnant with her 4th child and husband that is loving but growing increasingly impatient with caring for my mom in their home. Its too much for us to handle as mom's needs are growing almost daily. I am not physically or emotionally able to be full time care person and work as a single mother with my own  chronic medical conditions. Sister is in denial so I'm on my own in this search and processing all these feelings.     I am looking up phone numbers now and will begin making calls on Monday morning. Hopefully I can get some help in finding a place close to home and this stupid virus wont keep me from seeing her before she forgets us all or God forbid take her life as it has so many many people in nursing homes. This is so hard. I hate this disease. I hate it with all my soul.,False,Teach2000,2019-10-12,7.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147553283,,,AlzConnected,,,

Notes From The Cutting Edge: Israeli Researcher Dedi Meiri On Cannabis Alzheimer’s And Dementia      There is a large and growing body of anecdotal accounts of the efficacy of cannabis for treating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia...    If that’s the case then what about all the cannabis medicines that are simply composed of THC and CBD isolates in different ratios?    I guess for certain indications like pain for example it could be enough. But in a lot of the indications it won't be enough. I can tell you that if you look at leukemia what we find is that if you just treat it with CBD you will get zero reaction. The same goes for multiple sclerosis Alzheimer’s and even breast cancer… I have at least six different examples that I already proved that it's not the THC/CBD ratios or it's not enough. I can’t say that about everything but for sure in these kinds of indications.   So after ruling out just CBD and THC I asked him what does he suspect is making the difference?   I am 100% sure it's not the THC and CBD because I already eliminated them… but I’m still not really sure about the rest. I'm suspecting that the flavonoids might be playing a big role there… Just a few cannabinoids or families of cannabinoids but mainly probably flavonoids and terpenoids - give me a few more months and then I’ll tell you.    https://www.forbes.com/sites/abbierosner/2020/06/18/notes-from-the-cutting-edge-israeli-researcher-dedi-meiri-on-cannabis-alzheimers-and-dementia/#3720b0566ec2    I    am not entirely convinced of this: a certain amount of THC and cannabidiol in an optimized ratio is probably still helpful but finding strains that are high in flavonoids and terpenoids is likely even more important.  A diet high in flavonoids likely reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  And terpenoids in certain essential oils via aromatherapy and in panax ginseng have already shown promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147552923,,,AlzConnected,,,

It just seemed to happen so fast.  On Wednesday she was eating ice cream and today she won't eat or drink anything and she is moaning in pain. She has a second fall on Thursday and evidently she is bruised 'all over'.  She tries to get up and she falls.   Yesterday was a good day and she seemed much better and stayed quiet but awake.   So today the report is bad and I asked... when should I come (of course Covid complicates this ) and the Hospice nurse (the weekender) said NOW.  So she explained I should go while mom can still open her eyes and look at me.   Anyone know how fast this goes?  I know she is getting the lowest dose of morphine right now.   Thanks,False,Abuela,2012-06-24,605.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147553178,,,AlzConnected,,,

My father (F) just celebrated his 80th birthday at the beginning of the week. After deliberating with my husband whether to travel during the pandemic I decided to fly out and spend a few weeks. My husband came just for two day days to celebrate their joint birthday; he had to get back to work (remotely) and care for our cat. We both got tested for covid-19 and waited for the results before flying. It was a hard decision; weighing not wanting to potentially expose my parents versus taking precautions but living; being there for my dad's milestone birthday and provide respite care for my mom who is shouldering caring for him at home and edging towards burnout and physical exhaustion. ( Please no political debate regarding our traveling.)  My dad and husband had a good birthday; we celebrated my dad's birthday 3 days in a row... socially distancing and being careful of course! Got to see one of my 3 brothers and his wife. Another brother is driving here next week; will get to see him before I fly back. It will be good for my parents to have him here all next week to help out.  I mostly came on here to say: it is hard to see my dad declining. His short term memory is poor: he repeats things multiple times in one conversation doesn't remember what he ate for the previous meal or whether he ate asks 'what day it is' several times a day. His appetite is less his body doesn't regulate temperature changes well he gets tired by early evening mood can change quickly and feels ignored if you don't look at him while talking even if addressing someone else. Compound this with hip and back pain that the doctors say there is 'nothing more they can do' for him; makes standing for any length of time painful and unsteady on his feet and shoulder pain (from a fall) that he is going to have physical therapy for. In the recent past physical therapy hasn't helped him and he doesn't do the suggested exercises at home. My mother says he has fallen a few times in the past few months. I worry he will eventually break a bone and/or my mother will injure herself trying to help him.

The nurse said that I should not accept mom home until that baseline has been achieved as we are not set up in the home to handle a non-independent elder.

The plan was to transition him to a personal care home now that we've completed a guardianship through the court (FINALLY! But that's a whole different thread...). However he has now contracted COVID and we're all hunkered down at my home together. I work full time but I'm applying for leave so I can focus my full attention on the situation at home.   Thankfully he's not had any of the scarier symptoms so far. I'm hoping he's mostly asymptomatic. However his inability to communicate pain or discomfort concerns me. We're in contact with his primary care via telehealth and I have a pulse oximeter to keep a close eye on his blood oxygen. His doctor prefers we avoid the ER if possible given the situation with strained facilities in my city. I'm basically administering to all of his healthcare needs via instructions over webinar and - let me tell you - I'm no nurse.   I took him to the ER today after noticing he was rubbing his chest a lot. When I asked about it he said he feels a lot of pressure every time he breathes in and that it kept him up all night. I will add that he almost never reports pain. He had a heart attack and acute kidney damage late last year and said he felt ""great!"" when asked.   I realized that if I hadn't noticed that repeated rubbing I wouldn't have known he's having chest pain at all. I sometimes can't tell if I'm going over the top calling the doctor every day. It's just so hard to tell if there is a serious problem because of the the challenges with his communication skills. I also don't have a good baseline because he was living on his own prior to this. I feel sometimes that the doctors and nurses are annoyed with me.   Between working and caring for him and my spouse with COVID I worry I'm going to give myself a nervous breakdown worrying over everything. I tested negative last week but I'm not always taking very good precautions to minimize my own exposure at home. My dad requires so much assistance with everything that I sometimes don't remember to mask up or put on gloves if I'm rushing.   I've been through some things but this definitely ranks as one of the most unsettling experiences of my life.

We had his dementia under control and a lot of quality of life but could not manage the kidney disease and heart disease at the same time for long.  My 92 yr old mom is still at home with 24/7 care (mostly me) and day care. Mom has no mobility is a two person lift and I do use a mechanical lift for her.  Our Caregiver helpers are a nightmare over time. I will try to improve the current group (3) having them sign agreements for confidentiality ... I always have help for 2 hour AM and sometimes 3 hrs in the PM. Otherwise I handle PM myself because the caregivers are a pain in the neck ... boundaries and not focusing on my moms needs and my wishes and our routine.  Do you folks know where I can get sample staff agreements that I can customize for my situation. My helpers don't fill out their time sheets ask to be paid in cash and sometimes daily and gossip outside of work here at home with each other. Then I find out something about my mom from one of them ... the last to know. I do try to go to my home (out of town) one night a week but every time I do there are problems (drama) when I return. Accuse each other of stealing not taking care of my mom (double diapering) not giving medications etc.  Tried agencies for help but that was awful too. My mom needs a lot of help. But is easy.

Though my first choice is not to have two appointments in the same week for my mother I chose to get her in with her new PCP ASAP so that I could request home health services and rehab for her surgically reconstructed hip.  When I phoned to confirm our appointment the person on the phone warned me that the doctor is often up to an hour late.  This is even though my mother's appointment is the first one after lunch.  ????  The doctor will probably want blood drawn and this is going to be very hard for my mother.  She doesn't understand anymore about tests.  She has responded to blood being drawn as if it is either punishment or people assaulting her.  ---&gt;Question: can home health staff draw blood?   I suspect it would be less traumatic for my mother if she could be in a familiar environment and be immediately comforted by a meal or other distraction.  My mother is entirely incontinent and her bottom is suffering a terrible rash that ordinary cremes do not heal.  The exam will probably have to occur after a clean up and change of diaper and the tables at the doctor's office are so high that it is painful for her to be placed upon them.  She is a wheelchair user and has chronic pain from multiple sclerosis and the healed/healing surgically replaced hip.  ---&gt; Question: it takes two people minimum to help clean her up and change the diaper.  Am I within my rights to request a medical staff person to assist me?  She was a victim of sexual assault and I believe this experience makes intimate dealings even more horrible for her.  The exam is likely to be very triggering for her whether she actively remembers the assault or not.  Suggestions for ways to comfort her are welcome or any suggestions to work with the doctor so that she is less traumatized.  Her robocat is arriving today.  I could bring it with us to the appointment.  Do people think this would be over stimulating?  I don't want to introduce her to it during a time she would reject it.  ---&gt; What I would like the very most is to see the doctor not have blood drawn not have her bottom examined but to get home health okayed immediately and have a home doctor.  Is this even an option?  Many thanks friends.  May we all have the best day possible.,False,KawKaw,2019-11-22,397.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147550740,,,AlzConnected,,,

I also believe her to be resentful and lost patience   He’s moved in with me as of yesterday   When I visited last in October he was bored. Alzheimer’s was definitely eating his brain.

It’s like reading the encyclopedia. Last year we weren’t sure where he was due to the coping mechanisms w Paranoid schizophrenia. He is very crafty lol and slick but now I can clearly see where he is at stage wise   But unlike October where he was mobile suddenly since November when he was leaving hospital he can no longer get around. He is stiff as a board and in pain  Now he needs help getting up down walking...needs assist eating etc  He’s going to primary tomorrow but what’s happening??

Even though I knew it was coming you never know when. Mom had dementia and breast cancer that she had been battling for sometime. I had brought her to the care home near my house so I could make frequent visits to see her over this past year. At first I was able to take her for a nice drive visit gardens the beach and art shows in her wheel chair. Then she started declining and for the past 3 weeks was bedridden on morphine for the pain. One of the patients friends came to visit and could see I was having a tough time seeing my Mom like this and she said to me Have you told her it's ok to go? She shared she had lost her mother 3 years ago and she was able to tell her mother before she passed. I thought about it and then a week ago on a Tuesday night I could not sleep thinking about her laying in bed and how much she was suffering. The next morning I called my boss and told her I was going to leave early from work and visit my Mom. When I got there she was laying in bed eyes closed and I shut the door and told her everything I wanted to say. I told her how much I loved her what a wonderful mother she had been to our family. I told her this was no way to live and it was ok for her to go and be with Dad. He passed away 3 years ago and they had been married for 64 years. She never opened her eyes or said anything. But they say often times they can hear. When they called to tell me she passed I cried and felt very sad but felt at peace because I told her everything I wanted to say before she passed. I hope this helps someone who is in the same situation. Mom was 89 and had a wonderful husband and family. She will be missed.

Fair warning: Lengthy rant.      Let me preface this by saying that I have a weekend respite planned. I just a) Have to survive to get to it and b) Need some cooperation with the weather to make it all work out.  Mom has been super difficult lately. The caregivers will usually say ""She's had a good day"" when I get home. Within 15 minutes of my arrival though she has descended into a whining sniveling sack of frustration. In fairness she currently has a raw butt an aching arm and a toothache. (It's better now but her underpants are continuously rubbing right at the very area I'm trying to heal up. Using an OTC cream specifically for rectal area and an antibiotic cream.) She's uncomfortable vocal about it and alternately having trouble getting up to popping up out of bed or off the sofa every FIVE MINUTES.   As for the arm I took her to the doc on New Year's Eve. He ordered xrays for forearm and elbow. Results were negative. When I press for what else could be causing this pain or how to manage it I get a big fat ZERO in the help department. I am rubbing joint cream on it multiple times a day giving her Tylenol and helping her to keep it elevated. Best I can do.  Her cognition continues to drift in and out. I'm not always sure just who she thinks I am. Apparently not her ""birth"" child as she didn't have any children with her husband. (Hmmm.) But says she would have loved to have me as her daughter. OK then ...  The week before Christmas a recent breaker issue resulted in a complete loss of power on the second story. Some strategically placed cords make it possible for mom's environment (with the exception of an overhead bathroom light) to remain virtually unchanged. I got one bid one refusal to do the work and am trying to get a third contractor in. Looks like it's going to be a complex and expensive rewire to get things back to normal. She has adjusted to having a huge rechargeable worklight for the full bath. The good news is that we do have most lights (but not overheads) downstairs all outlets all HVAC and kitchen appliances. So no need to relocate. I'm the one who's bearing the bulk of inconvenience. No lights or TV in my bedroom. Having to prep work clothes by lantern or at first light in the morning. Can't charge phone or laptop in my room -- basic first world problems.  And then there's that work thing because I like eating and living indoors. (D*mn me anyhow!) 2020 is off like a rocket and I'm so busy my head spins most days.  In between all of this I've had car issues off and on. And weather has been weird making it hard to get time in at the other house that I need to sell. Meantime it's the time of year for an annual weekend event. Two years ago I had to leave early because of mom's issues and last year I didn't get to go at all. So … this year started planning several weeks ago to see how I can make this work. Normally I would stay Friday and Saturday nights. This year I'm going to be content if I can stay Saturday. Planning to come home Friday night go back Saturday and then stay 'til Sunday afternoon. BOTH caregivers and a relative will be tag-teaming during that weekend.    Praying weather cooperates to make it easy for me to go back and forth as planned. God knows I need this break. No. I MUST HAVE this break or I'm feeling the edge reaching my feet and I'm going to tumble over it. Some days I don't think I'd even care if I did.  Well-meaning people keep telling me ""Oh you're strong you can do it"" or ""You've got this."" But such platitudes do little after months no YEARS of just one thing after the other piling on and on and on. I need some of this other stuff to get situated so I can deal just with mom. As all of you know only too well just THAT would be enough!  Praying I can last 'til next weekend without any more BS popping up and maybe even a chance to resolve some of the BS I already got! And please weather gods shine favorably on me because I need this just about as much as I've ever needed anything.  Thanks for letting me vent.

155,62102cb5c9f833c0c92134eb,2147512645,2015-01-21 19:40:00,What Happens When Your LO is Dying and What Should You Do,This post is brought to the top every  two months or so for families who must start to say goodbye.   As a dementia care nurse for many years I've been with a number of my residents when they were dying. What I can tell you about the death if a person in the last stage of dementia is that  most simply slip quietly away.             When a person reaches the terminal stage of Alzheimer's disease they are no longer mobile and eating and drinking very little. This is the time for Hospice care if that is the wish of the family. They can help with many of the needs of the terminally ill especially pain control and keeping the person as comfortable as possible.  This information is to help you understand what to expect.           Eventually in stage 7 the person with dementia  will stop taking anything by mouth at all. This happens when the body begins to shut down. At one time it was common for families to ask for feeding tubes when this happened  fearing their LO would starve or dehydrate. But a lot of attention has been paid to the dying process in the last 20 years or so and we now know that feeding tubes and IVs will not really extend life and can cause discomfort and distress.  We  know that the dying reach a point when they do not experience thirst or hunger any more.    This is because the body is no longer able to absorb metabolize or excrete fluids or nutrition. Forcing liquids or even using IV fluids puts an added strain on the heart lungs and other organs causing breathing difficulties edema and other problems. For this reason hunger and thirst decline.                                                                 A person who is in this stage is also at risk for infections blood clots and pneumonia all of which may hasten the death but they are actually part of the dying process. If families choose to have the person treated for these problems the person may linger a little longer but death is still near.                     After refusing fluids and food the person will begin sleeping longer and longer periods and eventually will be in a coma. Soon caregivers may notice that the hands and feet are cold and the skin has a mottled appearance. Actually as the body shuts down circulation is reduced in the limbspreserving blood and oxygen for the body core and brain. In reality if a person's temperature is taken at this point we might find it is very high. For this reason although care givers may try to put extra blankets on the person if they are still able they will throw them off. Better to  simply use a sheet.       At this time there may be some mottling of the skin especially on the legs. This is normal and a sign that death is near. Breathing may sound moist as the swallowing mechanism is gone. Sometimes suction is used to decrease fluid accumulation in the throat but this is rarely needed. This stage may last a few hours or even a day or two. Eventually the person will simply stop breathing and death will occur when the heart stops a few minutes later.                What should family members say or do during this time? I firmly believe that dying dementia patients are aware that LO are there at the bedside. I always encouraged families to talk to the person stroke their cheek use lotion for hand or foot massages and sing or read to them. On occasion (but not frequently). families will report that their LO had a moment of lucidity just before coma set in. At times they have been able to say I love you or goodbye. This is a special gift but few of the dying are able to do this. None-the-less there are indications that they are at least somewhat aware of their surroundings and we should do all we can to make them as comfortable as possible and assure them that they are not alone.      The Canadian Alzheimer's Society has published a pamphlet on line with additional information I thought was helpful. Here is their website:  http://www.alzheimer.ca/~/media/Files/national/Progression-series/progression_endoflife_e.pdf       Barbara Karnes hospice nurse has a video/booklet on death from a hospice prospective:  www.brainsupportnetwork.org/gone-from-my-sight-terrific-online-videobooklet/   Hope this helps Stephanie Z,False,Stephanie Z,2011-12-15,4217.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147512645,,,AlzConnected,,,

My 80-year old mother has been in MC for the past two years and has really thrived until recently. The facility is assisted living so it helps with medication and ADLs and provides enriching activities which my mom enjoys.  Since my mom has been there she has put on about 25-30 pounds and has developed type II diabetes and arthritis in her hips and knees. She has been on metformin (oral diabetes med) for about a year but it is really not controlling her sugar levels at all. My mom's doctor wants to have her on either weekly or daily diabetes injections and wants her on a reduced calorie diet to help with her weight sugar and arthritis pain. Unfortunately the facility cannot give injections nor a special diet.   So the doctor has added another oral medication to see if the diabetes can be controlled. When I visited mom on Saturday I found her finishing up her morning snack of a powdered sugar donut. Ugh!!  My sister and I are seriously considering moving her to a MC facility that has an enhanced assisted living license. They would be able to put her on the appropriate diet and give injections if needed. Hopefully if there she would also lose some weight to relieve the stress on her hips and ankles.  I have two concerns. First is the move itself. My mom is comfortable in her current MC and is doing as best as can be expected. We really do not want to make multiples moves at this stage and she is not ready for a nursing home. Second: the only facility that would offer the new level of care is about 35 minutes from me (and the drive is no picnic in the winter).  So do I keep her at her current place and know that we will have to add more medicines to control diabetes and manage pain for arthritis? And knowing that she will not lose weight there? Or do I move her to the other facility knowing that I may not be able to visit as often (I work full-time and have teenage kids)? And knowing that we will likely have to move her again to a nursing home?

Things began to really spiral in May of '19 with her sustaining a broken collar bone along with a number of hospital stays for pain edema and severe pulmonary hypertension along with severe aortic stenosis. We moved her to a higher care center and the doctors encouraged us to halt the hospital visits along with stopping many prescriptions she was taking. There is a DNR and no antibiotics treatment directive now in place. She's no longer mobile sleeps most of the time is on a soft diet only due to worsening swallowing issues and doesn't eat or drink much has an ongoing wet cough and no longer recognizes family or friends. She has been in hospice care for 2-3 months and things seemed to level off before the most recent report. It's a sad sad way to see her.   The latest report from the head hospice nurse is that my mom lost 13 lbs in the last month or about 10% of her total weight. She's lost a total of 40+ lbs in the last six months. We're not being told exactly why they think she's losing weight but I have to believe the swallowing issues and possibly cachexia (body can no longer absorb nutrients from food) are the main issues.   Has anyone here seen this kind of extreme weight loss in a month's time?

After that she disappeared in the sense she lost everything her autonomy the capacity to walk straight etc.... I changed the care house and it was fine for 8 months then again abused happende again and I had to give her drugs because she reacted strongly. Since then it has been a non stop fight with the care house direction team to ensure they provide. I go there every day I see everything it is horryfying the way they treat people some are good 50% but for the rest lots of bullsh-- and evil.  My mum suffers from scoliosis a servere one and is in pain all the time from time to time she will tell me "" I have enough"" ""I have to go"" and then she walks walks  walks can't seem to stop   She struggle sleeping there but when I take her to my place she sleeps with me. Over there I do not knwo what's happen she feels so unsecure....  My dad is still alive and live in his house I live in a tiny studio flat can't afford 24/7 help for mum to keep her with me.  She is in a sevre stage and basically as soon as our LO can no longer communicate they are abandonned....     I am struggling so much my sisters have completly abandonned my mum as my dad that has his sickness I live in a such small place I can not bring her here and my family refuse to bring her back home.     What to do... I have the feeling I am abandonning her in this sh--.... I can not suppirt knowing that she might be abused or not well looked fater for the last three weeks I have seen bruises again and of course there is no explicatio again no remorse from them no worries she is suffering and it break my heart to see that.     ANy advise would be welcome have you been hrough that?",False,valou7,2018-01-02,17.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147551169,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mum initially stayed in my home then 3 different medical centers. The last one is the 'best of the best' in the country or so I'm told (the other 2 were places were people came to die i'm afraid).  Still all 3 shared the same HUGE issue when it came to caring for her.   - Despite the flashy brochures and promises of 'personalized' care everything is done in  group sessions that she can't relate to very well.    - During the day and nights  the nurse visits are short  and high-level 'are you ok' is asked to someone who's essentially mute (nfPPA). It's nonsensical.  - During the afternoons some group activites are on but not every day. And what exist last 1h . If it wasn't for my efforts (see below) this patient would be sitting in her room staring at the freaking wall  (she lost interest in tvs and lost the ability to operate the ipad she loved so much).  I'll be brutally honest regardless of how much money I spent this has been a permanent issue between facilities.   They feed them and those that can't get dressed or eat on their own get extra assistance but just for these matters.     It's dreadful i won't lie to you. I wouldn't do this to my freaking dog. And it all comes down to one thing: money. Yes putting a nurse on call 24/7 to animate someone's day play music they like change the tv channel help them try to read an image book or go out and have a walk or swim in a small pool or pain this would create stratospheric costs.But that facility doesn't even exists no matter how much cash you got on hand ( note: if it does let me know the name and i'll move my mum tomorrow)   So essentially I'm paying 3000 euros a month for my mum to stay in a hotel with some medical angle.   Evidently this was not acceptable yet the tall the disease has taken on me and my family (it's been 4 years now) meant I couldn't be that support for her at least not every day. So I hired a private carer he's 1800 a month. He plays music for her encourages cognitive development through proven methodologies by the best specialists in the business he's very nice and he reports any issue back to me immediately via whatsapp.   Here's what bothers me: i have to pay someone to check the medecines where given properly report issues with incontinence pick up on subtle signs that her mood or cognitive abilities are changing.    But in the previous facility he actually saved her life: my mum had a run up to a stroke and it's only because of his initiative and calling an air ambulance that she survived. Doctors from the ER confirmed she would have been dead if we had brought her only 10 minutes later.    So I want to know: are you experiencing the same issues? or did you find the promised land where patients are regularly cared for as part of both individualized and group activities? I could't' even find them online bar one 'experimental' program in australia which has now closed. Or are you facing the same issue: 'care' consist of sparse group sessions throughout the week a bit of physio here and there and the rest of the time being 'wheeled off' to the tv room full of patients with varying levels of need.

I would categorize Mom and somewhere between 6 and 7 today.  Probably early 7 at this point. She has absolutely wonderful care now which I will  forever  be grateful for.  I am ""long distance"" and although I have made frequent extended trips home I think I'll always feel guilty for not being there 24/7.  The times I explored that family members advised against it citing the fact that there was nothing I could do and it would simply make me more depressed. I talked on the phone with her every day for the past 8 or so years like I was trying to experience every last bit of Mom that I could.  Today she can no longer use or understand the phone and furthermore she has mostly lost the ability to make any type of coherent sentence.  I visit frequently but she has lost the ability to recognize me as her ""son"" for a while now.  The few times I open up about it I find myself circling back to the notion that it's not just that my mom is ""dying"" but  how  she is dying.  Somehow I never expected anything like this.  I realize that's profoundly ignorant to say now but up until age 30 or so I really expected ""death"" to be like a 3 month process max maybe a year?  Really I somehow just believed that to be how it all works.  I never ever expected... whatever the hell this is.  Finally to my point - I am actually having trouble trying to separate how much of this is her disease and how much of this is just me.  Like would I have simply found something else to be dangerously depressed over?  I mean I have been steadily noticeably losing the most important person in the world to me for over a decade.  I have grown to see occasions like the Holidays or her birthday or my birthday as mere benchmarks of her decline.  Sometimes I wonder if I have subconsciously sort of allowed myself to fall apart and she has fallen apart.  If that makes any sense at all.  What this disease has done to me has been profound.  I have become atheist.  I have become darker - somewhere between a pessimist and an extreme ""realist"" (I think the term is ""nihilistic"").  I have become almost dismissive of people who are ""sad"" that their 94 year old grandmother died of a sudden stroke while gardening.  I have gone from a person who is tremendously career driven with goals to somebody who is just trying to make it through this without destroying everything.  People have been concerned about me for a while which I hate and feels so selfish.  I do see doctors and specialists and take meds.  I try to do the right things to promote my mental health.  Oh and I have become seemingly obsessed with people who are in worse situations than this and almost study  how  they get through it.  (By the way honestly I think women are profoundly better at this type of life challenge than men are).

And he learned too about pain…”  “Because of Jesus God understands truly understands our pain.  Our tears become his tears.  We are not abandoned.”  *  Yancey sums up his fourth point by writing of Jesus he “has felt every stab of pain and every sorrow.”     *     If anyone would like me to pray for them leave your request below.  I will respond on this post.  In Christ we are all brothers and sisters.,False,VKB,2011-12-04,3734.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147551281,,,AlzConnected,,,

She hangs on my every inane piece of small talk and whenever Dad says something kind she rolls her eyes .   It's so hard watching the rift form and widen between the two of them.

They're bringing a portable potty seat that can also be situated around the commode to provide arm braces.

Social worker and chaplain come monthly or also more often if needed.  Prescriptions will be BROUGHT TO MY DOOR every 2 weeks. She can have all the ones she currently is on. They're not taking her off of anything. In fact they told HER if she is in pain she can have a pain pill. I never have to worry about running out of Trazadone or Ativan ever again.

Important considerations  Full assessments are needed to evaluate for sources of pain and/or anxiety such as hypoxia incontinence constipation full bladder/urinary retention positioning pressure ulcers hunger or thirst social isolation/loneliness spiritual distress issues.  Open and frequent communication with COVID-19 residents and families is challenging but essential. Family communication will likely be via telephone. Provide daily updates about the resident’s status and let them know what interventions you are doing to help manage symptoms. Consider a protocol to allow family visitation near end of life.  Avoid CPAP BiPAP nebulizer treatments and suctioning in COVID-19 positive or suspected residents as these are aerosolizing procedures.  Consider Palliative Care or Hospice referral for support with sedation continuous morphine infusion and for support for symptoms not responding to treatments.  General orders for comfort care  Stop all non-essential medications. If unable to swallow discontinue all oral meds.  Discontinue non-essential routine orders: labs weights.  Offer pleasure foods as tolerated and if resident is able to swallow safely.  Keep environment as calm and soothing as possible keep light and noise at a minimum.  Check on resident frequently especially for those unable to use call light.

Mom's longstanding bedsore the one we could never get under control completely morphed into a secondary one which had only this week started to get worse again. Result: abscess. Her regular hospital nurse ordered liquid antibiotic in hopes of clearing it up some. It arrived yesterday afternoon.  Mom has been to say the least uncomfortable. Sleeping more even without medication. But for the most part her waking time has been miserable. She hasn't had real food since Thursday outside a few bites of soup last night and a few bites of pancakes a few hours ago. She did drink some this morning after refusing to drink much of last night.  Around 9:30 she practically leapt out of bed. ""I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. Let's get the car and go!"" She was screaming and resisting all efforts to comfort her. She said she was in terrible pain yet clamped her jaw firmly against medication. Half the toes on her left foot were turned under meaning she couldn't walk even if she could manage to stand. And yet in her resistance to me it was like wrestling a bear!  I tried to remove her diaper which was completely soiled. That took effort. Then tried to get one back on her. MAJOR FAIL. Finally had to settle for having one taped loosely on one side with a second unsecured on the other side. At least I got to clean her up and then try to manage that horrible wound.  Finally got some morphine in her and then a little later an Ativan (as advised by Hospice). Apparently these two meds are made to work in concert. Good to know! I figured I should get the on-call nurse here to properly dress the wound and get a diaper on her. Maybe even showing me a way I can move her better with my screwed up hands. When the oncall nurse called me back I explained what was going on. Her initial response: ""Have you considered hiring someone to help you?""    WHAT?! I quickly explained that I DO have caregivers but only during the week. ""Well we can't stay with her."" Um that's not what I was asking for woman!!!! Again want the wound treated and help with the diapers. It was my understanding that that IS their territory! All about keeping them comfortable right?! This woman has all the compassion of a cobra. Thank God our RN and CNA are both so wonderful. Wish I could reach either of them.  ""I can dress her wound so I'll come but it will be a while.""  That was 2 hours ago.

We watch our loved ones wind through them at varying speeds or even in varying orders sometimes a leg in one and a leg in another. But then what some caregiver along the way has dubbed Stage 8 occurs. So here I am locked in the throes of Stage 8.   As I see it there are three major substages to Stage 8.   Stage 8 begins with the hardest part right off the bat: the death of your loved one. While you're still reeling from that (and likely numb in a way you never anticipated) the second substage occurs.   It's second though only chronologically. It's the burial arrangements. If you're lucky all or at least most of this already has been done for you. You just need to call the proper folks to set it into motion. For the less lucky it's a horrible game of THIS or THAT? THAT or THIS? How much -- or how little -- can you afford? But maybe you're still numb so the pain of it all -- including sticker shock -- eludes you at least for now.  And then there's the service. Last chronologically second in difficulty. It's the last stop. Finality. Closure. And if it happens to be taking place anytime soon it's limited. Limited in what you can do and how many people can be present. Just 10. No more. No hugging touching personal exchanges. Please stay 6 feet apart.  The rest of Stage 8? I imagine it has to be putting together all of those leftover pieces of grief that don't seem to get addressed along the way. Answering the nagging ""now what?"" with people and places and things that mean something. And guilt. Erasing the guilt of daring to move on debating whether you have the right to. Debating the justice or the lack thereof of resuming something like life.  And after ALL THAT … doesn't it seem like there should be a STAGE 9?!  To me Stage 9 is the phase where after enduring Stages 1-7 and then managing to work through all of the pain and loose ends of Stage 8 the transition occurs. It's the official parole if you will the pardon the permission to hit ""play"" and return to life.   Stage 9 … the ""other"" side of this most dreadful horrible insidious disease.

Now Mom is in a nursing home where she will remain until she passes.  She is actually doing better but still will never go home.  When she was hospitalized it became obvious that Dad was struggling with driving memory confusion.  He put off going to the doctor until April.  Unbeknownst to us his doctor had been monitoring him for dementia for the last several years.  But after this appointment and after being named POA for both parents the doctor called me.  He was taking dad's drivers license and believed that Dad would have to be under 24/7 care within a year or two.  This was unthinkable my dad was always strong smart and unstoppable.    Fast forward to December 2019.  I have been taking care of the bills cooking cleaning and chauffeuring Dad everywhere since April.  He is angry and confused.  The morning of December 22 Dad called in severe pain.  I raced to meet an ambulance at his house.  He was diagnosed with DVT in his leg.  After several days in the hospital (Christmas in the hospital again this year!) he was transferred to the same nursing home as Mom for rehab.  When admitted they gave him the cognitive test which he scored 4 out of 30. (In April he scored 15 out of 30).  Again he is angry at God his doctor and the world.   Now this past week I had them retest my Dad.  He scored 0 out of 30.  I am desperate for some real direction.  I understand that they can't give me a timeline.  But I feel like a kid stealing from the candy jar every time I pay the nursing home.  He would be furious if he knew that insurance wasn't covering it. I have to lie to him constantly.    I will run out of cash soon so I will have to sell his car and house.  The house he built with his own hands.  Their savings is almost gone.  I'm devastated for him.  But I haven't told him.  There are no other options.  Soon all he worked for will be gone.  But he is in a wonderful facility with my Mom.   And by the way my brother is not available much and my sister is completely useless.  I need her to get her belongings out of the house so I can clean out the house.  (she will need a large truck and a large storage unit to move it to)  She will not answer my calls.    I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round that never ends.  I need help thank God for my husband.  He's supportive but it's not fair that my parents have invaded our marriage.  My children are grown but I would like to visit them.  I had to cancel my vacation plans last year because my sister who knew my vacation plans told me at the last minute that they were leaving town the same day we were to leave.     Do I tell my Dad that I have to sell everything?  How?  I'm worried that he will take his anger out on my Mom He isn't violent but he yells and pouts about everything.  Can anyone help me with a timeline?  How much time do I have until my Dad is calmer? They are putting him on an anti-anxiety med for during the day and a sleep aid at night.    Sorry for the long post.  So much to say so many problems.  I'm trying to keep all of the balls in the air but I'm running out of steam.,False,RosesareRed,2020-03-06,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147551354,,,AlzConnected,,,

Dear Hubby wanted to bring her home from the hospital when discharged but I was pushing for Rehab because I thought they would be better able to care for her with her broke leg since she is double incontinent I didn't want to risk hurting her by moving her wrong. Plus she already Lord Jesus it all day and I knew it would be 10 times worse with her being in serious pain. Not to mention a much needed respite for us from caring for her and since insurance was picking up the tab the Hubby decided to let her go. We've used this rehab before and didn't have any problems so that's where we sent her to. Boy are we regretting it now that we have her home.  Actually we were regretting it when they stopped letting us visit due to the Covid-19 virus last week trying to keep anyone from bringing it in to the residents there which we understood the reasoning behind it. But not being able to visit we couldn't make sure she was being properly cared for and our visit help keep her from slipping further off into dementia land but with her only having a week left we let her stay instead of having her discharged early. We picked her up today and got her home and it doesn't seem to us like they have worked on her as far as keeping her paralyzed side loosened up so her joints will bend. I've never seen a bedsore before but I believe she has 3 at the top of her diaper area in the back just below the small of her back which leads me to believe they weren't keeping her turned regularly if at all. To me she looks like she has lost weight in her face and legs because she probably wasn't eating enough. I understand that they can only do what the patient will allow and if she refuses there is not much they can do about it but if we had her home we could have pushed her more as far as moving her limbs and sitting up in a chair. The man barely touched her arm today when transferring her from their wheel chair to hers for the ride home and she was telling him he about broke her arm which she is always complaining when we move her so I figure that's why they didn't do much with her. I don't think they even tried to put her into a wheel chair until yesterday so they could find out if she could sit in one to transfer home or if she needed to come by ambulance. I tried so hard when she had the stroke to keep her from getting bedsores and thought I did a pretty good job at it seeing how she didn't have any when she went in for the broke leg. I just pray we can get them cleared up and not let her get anymore.,False,mabeene,2017-06-12,266.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147551668,,,AlzConnected,,,

TODAY:  She had a relatively good day. Slept a lot. Ate some. Was nice to her caregiver. Even drank some Miralax for her something I failed to accomplish yesterday.   THIS EVENING:  She was mostly sweet but chock full of conspiracy. Over the weekend she had started talking about some little boy with a red wagon who got in trouble for something he didn't do. She informs me that they are going to ""hang him tomorrow."" Um OK. I try to comfort her by telling her that no one is getting hanged that people aren't hanged anymore but quickly abandon this tact; she's convinced he'll be swingin'.  After several refusals of dinner she shocks me by eating almost everything on her plate. I had to intervene as her eating started to be more misses than hits. Trouble holding utensils and then commandeering food to her mouth is becoming more of an issue in recent weeks. I scoop out some baked potato create a bite and alternate between feeding her and positioning a loaded spoon in her hand.    TONIGHT:  As the second episode of Antiques Roadshow wound down so did Mom's semi-pleasant demeanor. She began to weep about the little boy. She started blaming me for his plight and for her pending jail time. It didn't matter what I said she could not be consoled. I took her for her pre-bed bathroom visit and despite having to treat her bedsores that all went well. Once she was situated in bed I gave her some banana pudding hoping that might ease her frustration and would get through meds without issue.   That didn't happen.  Instead the wires starting crossing and sparking all over the place while I was downstairs pulling her night meds together. They were sparking so much her room should've been ablaze by the time I got back upstairs!    As I set her drink and meds down she began to yell ""No no no no no no!"" repeatedly. This isn't uncommon. It usually passes quickly. NOT tonight. After I got the first few pills in her mouth she KEPT yelling NO and I thought for a second she was going to spit them out. Then she refused to get a drink meanwhile the pills were just lolling on her tongue. I asked her to open her mouth so I could try and push them toward the back of her throat she opened and then clamped her mouth down firmly onto my fingers. Luckily she only has lower teeth and not that many. Even so the force of the clamp was painful to my swollen and aching hands (RA). I tried to reassure her that these (at least some of them) were for pain to help the aches she told me she was suffering from. Her jaw remained clenched. She wouldn't take her remaining pills or the swallow of morphine she started last week.  I walked out. I returned five minutes later and she was cussing and trying to twist my hands away from her. Still clenching her jaw she defiantly cussed me out. I continued to repeat that I knew she was hurting and all I wanted to do was to help her with her pain. After about the fourth time of my mantra she stopped … and opened her mouth! Stunned I still managed to get her meds in and down quickly. That was over an hour ago.   It took another 15-20 minutes before she finally went quiet.  She's been out for about 45 minutes and I'm still trying to figure out what brought this on. She had been relatively OK just a few minutes before and then BAM! Complete 180 in personality.   It was so shocking to go through. Usually there's some cue before something like this would happen. It's equally mind-boggling to me that this woman who is literally wasting away and who not 20 minutes before struggled (with assistance) to walk 25 steps to the bathroom could put up such an animated fight.

His doctor suggested last summer that I begin to make plans for his care for late stages. And thankfully I did. DH has been gentle and kind and so pleasant to be around so I have been taking my time. However two weeks ago he showed signs of pain and was found to have a kidney stone. He required surgery and while they removed the stone it set off a whole series of other physical issues. the doctor suggested rehab. Our chosen care home still has him on their list but his name won't come up for at least a year. Our second choice has a rehab facility but they rejected him. We got approval for our third choice waited five days for insurance approval then he was discharged to rehab. while I was allowed to visit him during the first several days I was told one morning that I could no longer come in. I understand and feel fortunate to have been allowed for so long. But that meant his transfer to rehab was done by strangers I have not seen where he is and I am of course not allowed to visit.   I do not believe he will be coming home and I would very much like to have him placed in this facility when he finishes rehab. I have been told that because he will be a medicaid admission moving from rehab directly into the long term will be the best way to get him placed in long term care. I cannot private pay.  We have a care conference scheduled by conference call on Friday. I have so so many concerns but want to stay focused and ask questions and give information that is most helpful for everyone.

Yesterday my fathers insurance allowed for only seven days inan acute rehabilitation facility that will work with dementia patients and hewas transferred.  We thought it was bestto allow him the chance to improve his condition and heal from the injury asmuch as possible with the ultimate goal of sending him back to his memory carefacility in a wheel chair.   I saw my dad for about thirty seconds in the lobby of therehab after he was unloaded from the ambulance and quickly tried to explain everythingto him “You are here to heal and work out. It is going to be great!” before they quickly whisked him off.  I clearly could not go any farther into thefacility since they are on an ordered lock down.  When I finally got my bearings about me andlooked up I realized that this ‘rehab’ was a public care nursing/rehabfacility. As I stood in the lobby and was looking through the windows of thecommon areas I overheard a conversation between a doctor and man explainingthat a patient had attacked her roommate and that she is ill with a bad cough butthe doctor didn’t ‘think’ she had corona virus another staff member came outwith a bloody towel and explained that to that same doctor that another patienthad ‘an open wound on their head that won’t stop bleeding’ and two employeeswere chatting in a corner and dropping the f-bomb to each other in casual conversation. Needless to say I was mortified and disgusted. This place is a dump the kind of placeyou would send a parent if you had zero other options the residents I saw throughthe window were a hot mess - and I feel blindsided and terrified for my poordad. I spoke with the intake person and voiced my concerns but I was unable tospeak with the director or case manager in person due to the lock down becauseof COVID - 19.  My gut feeling is to askfor him to be removed and quickly try to find a private pay nursing home (sightunseen) and let the hope of him recovering even a little bit go away.  This is a terrible situation only exacerbatedby corona virus precautions I am stressed and tired and don’t know that I madethe right decision to allow him to stay at this rehab...,False,dementiadaughter1,2019-04-01,16.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147551555,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's comforting to have a resource like this to consult with as I struggle with my family's own journey with my mom suffering from dementia.    I am the adult daughter of a dementia sufferer (Mom) who lives in Toronto Canada. I live in Chicago. My 84 year father cares for Mom who is 79 years of age. Mom was diagnosed with dementia back in late 2014. Mom is now in stage 4 or 5 often forgetting who dad is becoming agitated angry depressed and scared. Dad isn't doing a good job of securing doctor appointments often forgetting them or just not showing up to them at all. He'll often leave mom alone for short periods of time walking around the courtyard of their independent living community for fresh air during COVID which at this point is dangerous. Me and my two brothers think it's time dad got a personal service worker for mom and we want to keep tabs on her medical issues that dad isn't handling well. Dad is depressed very impatient with mom and deteriorating physically himself. Mom doesn't understand what's going on with COVID and is scared when dad tells her people are dying and that she has to wash her hands. When she doesn't wash her hands he gets impatient with her. We've approached dad in the most loving manner possible suggesting he get help 3 - 4 days a week with a PSW and that he allow us joint power of healthcare to help make decisions and talk to doctors on mom's behalf. Dad's response to us was that he doesn't need any help. We are so worried about mom's quality of life we are considering forcing dad by intervening with legal action. How have the rest of you navigated this part of being the adult child of a dementia sufferer? This has been going on for about 1 year now but recently escalated to a more critical level when my mom peed the bed was confused for multiple days in a row and had severe pain that was unaddressed and spent an entire day in bed.

The doctor had little bedside manner would talk to me and my father about my mother right in front of her and even the care worker they called in gave business cards to my father and I but not to my mother sitting right between us. I was appalled by the whole event and Mom was confused and anxious maybe even traumatized by it all. My father has tried to discuss her dementia with her but to no avail. She just shuts down and my father never pushed the issue. Now it's almost a year later Mom's progressed (probably Stages 4/5) and there's really no point in trying to have a heart to heart on the matter.  But I read this in another thread written by a Peer Volunteer and it made my blood run cold thinking about taking my mother back to the doctor for an accurate diagnosis (obviously not from the same dismissive doctor):   You will need to know with accuracy just what type of dementia your mother has; the gold standard for accurate diagnosis is a Neurologist who sees dementia patients as a routine part of his/her practice. Accurate diagnosis is crucial to management and a care plan. There are different types of dementia and medications for one type may be contraindicated in another and make symptoms even worse. So; an appointment with a specialist will get the dynamics moving in the right direction.   Getting Mom to the doctor to get that garbage diagnosis was a Herculean feat (we did it to get her medication and memantine was prescribed). It's clear my mother has dementia but is ""probably Alzheimer's"" by someone who's not a neurologist and didn't care whether my mother came back to see her enough? (Seriously the doctor said to me ""Oh she won't be back"" based on how upset my mother was but nor did she really care or give me any options or compassion on the matter).  Anyway I doubt I'm the only person here who has doctor-resistant LOs and no ""accurate diagnosis."" Mom is not a danger to herself or others currently and she's been on the memantine for months now and isn't showing any adverse affects. So I wouldn't say there's a rush to get to the doctor. Oh I should add that she's fine going to the doctor for routine stuff or if she's in pain but if she gets a whiff of anything having to do with dementia (and she's still sharp as a tack in that regard...and doctors not subtle enough for her) then she freaks out (and I don't blame her and then my Dad and I are traumatized cuz she's like a hurt little bird).  Anyway I typed that all pretty fast but I think you get the gist. Any advice? More to the point do we HAVE to get an accurate diagnosis and put all of us through this again? I'm hoping no.   Oh and she has Kaiser insurance so we're screwed right?",False,LittleVolcano,2018-11-16,81.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549364,,,AlzConnected,,,

It can be a difficult challenge when our Loved Ones (LOs) live far away from where we are.  You are a very compassionate and loving daughter as well as a good advocate for your parents in seeking input for the situation.j  *************************************************************************   For other readers here is Lone Daughters Post regarding her parents :   My parents live about 600 miles away. My mom was diagnosed with dementia this year but we know she has not been the same since 2016 when she had a massive heart attack and a quadruple bypass with complications including a bleed out after the removal of a balloon pump. She was in the hospital/for 3+ months and then rehab nursing home before she finally starting coming back mentally. I am not sure that my dad is being completely honest with me about how much she is declining. This summer when she came to visit she did not recognize me or my house for a few minutes but then was ok for the rest of the 10 days or so she was here. My dad mentioned an incident where she was setting the table at home and set a place setting for my brother (who passed away in 2010). That was about it for major issues. Otherwise there is forgetting where she put things repeating herself some mixing dreams with reality etc- some of which she has done for years.       What prompted me to join this forum is that when I called them yesterday to wish them a Happy Thanksgiving I could tell there was something wrong with my mom. She kept asking my dad to tell me who he was and he kept saying his name. She kept saying my dad wasn't there and she didn't know where he was but there was this man there saying he was my dad's name. At the same time she was telling me what they made for Thanksgiving dinner and how she couldn't remember how to make our family noodles. My dad was on the phone too saying he was there all day. He made small talk and I told them to call me back this morning which they did not do. I called them and she was better but firmly believed my dad was gone for part of the day yesterday and there was a man there wearing his clothes. She said it was weird and she was kind of out of it yesterday but at the same time she was asking my dad to tell me how good their pumpkin pie was. She was sure of this other man and my dad being gone. Anyway she was pretty much like her ""normal"" other than the thing about the man in my dad's clothes. I can't get my dad to call me when she is asleep or he is alone. Whenever I call she answers or if he does he puts her on the phone too. Not sure what to do does this come and go? Is my dad covering for her? What do I do? I am so far away. I have a daughter turning 13 next week and am starting a new stressful sales job. I am overwhelmed with stress and worry. I will call again tomorrow to see how things are going... Any thoughts advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated!   *************************************************************************  This is indeed a challenge.  A young daughter and a high stress sales position in a new job is no small thing; I am so sorry this is happening  .    It is not unusual for a person having bypass to have neurological changes; sometimes this can mean signiicant changes.  If she actually has one of the dementias such as Alzheimer's or another dementia in addition this will certainly cause ongoing changes but this does need medical assessment.  It may well be that your father may be ""covering"" for her a bit and he may be hoping for the best and be in a bit of denial for what is happening.  There is also the possibility that his reasoning and judgment are somewhat compromised but that of course is just a thought; you will be able to assess that.  The most important thing that perhaps you can do is to contact the  Alzheimer's Assn. at (800) 272-3900  and ask to be transferred to a Care Consultant.  There are no fees for this service. Consultants are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia and family dynamics.  They are of great support have much information and can help us with our problem solving.  They will transfer you to the office closest to you to speak to a Care Consultant there who will in all probability know of services that may be needed in your parents area.  The most important thing would be to have your mother seen by a dementia specialist.  A good Neurologist who sees dementia patients as a routine part of his/her practice would be a good choice especially in light of the cardiac bypass and the changes that can wrought.  If your parents do not have such a specialist the Care Consultant may well have names of excellent ones in your parents area. Also if you do not have the legal paperwork such as Durable Powers of Attorney the Consultant may also have names of Elder Law Attorneys in your parents state/area who could assist with this.  If there are assets to pay for such a service there is also the option of hiring a Geriatric Case Manager.  Most of these are either RNs or Social Workers.  They will literally do an in-depth assessment of the clients in their home and of  their situation as well as identifying unmet needs and can contact you with feedback.  They can actually make appointments and conduct any business or other items needing addressing and get back to you.  These professionals even hire and oversee caregiver aides when and if that becomes necessary as well as finding appropriate placement should that ever become a necessity. They also follow their clients in their home and organize health care appointments etc..  Here is the link to a professional association that describes the profession and you can find such professionals by using your parent's zip code.    https://www.aginglifecare.org/   You are sensing the changes and know that something is afoot and needs screening.  If you can gain your father's cooperation in getting your mother to her dementia specialist that would be helpful in having this assessed.  It would also be helpful for her to be seen by her primary care physician.  She may have another medical issue that is causing or contributing to all of this.  Both physicans need to screen her meds to ascertain if there may be a med effect and also she would be best served having a complete panel of labs done to screen body systems as well a having a urinalysis to check for a ""silent"" UTI.  Sometimes there is an easily addressed physical reason for such changes and it is always best to rule that out; not everything is due to dementia.  Those UTIs are called ""silent"" because there will be no signs of pain or burning but there is often a significant change in behaviors and sometimes even changes in cognition or function.  Many of us have experienced that in our LOs so it is worth having all of this checked out.  It sounds as though at this time that the parents are physically safe and secure and physical needs being met so you will have a bit of time to get the ball rolling on this while taking care of your own new job and daughter.   It may take a bit of time but once your mother is seen and assessed things may be much clearer.  Please do let us know how everything is going and how you are doing; we are all here in support of one another and that now includes you too.

Had to transport her just over an hour away from where she is currently staying.  My sister came with us this time and thank goodness.  I could not have done it without her.  By the time we got her back to the AL center she was sobbing with pain.  There was no place to change her at the hospital (really????) so she had sat in her own excrement in a diaper nearly the entire four hours of the trip to and from.  She was screaming in pain as they changed her at the AL center.  I cannot get that sound out of my mind.  It replays over and over when I relax a moment. And yes she had a pain pill before she left and one when we returned.  She also has MS and has had chronic pain for many years.   Have I mentioned that she is unable to walk or transfer from the wheelchair herself?  Success: The surgeon was terrific and got us an order for physical rehabilitation.  I do believe she can regain function at least enough to transfer to and from the wheelchair and maybe even to use the walker for a little while each day.  That would add so much to her life.  Insurance is giving me the run-around in getting a geriatric psychiatrist.  Tired of chasing necessary care.  It is outrageous that ""behavioral"" health is considered separate from physical health.  (Long standing pet peeve.)  Ordered a wheelchair cushion for her wheelchair that I should have ordered ages ago but I was not thinking clearly about that very basic need for some ridiculous reason.  It should be delivered today.  I managed to wash dishes.  The rest of the house is a disaster.  Mayhap a fairy godparent will get me a spring cleaning for a gift.  : )  That would be such a blessing!

And do not be worried for the joy of the Lord is your strength and your stronghold.” 11 So the Levites quieted all the people saying “Be still for the day is holy; do not be worried.” 12 Then all the people went on their way to eat to drink to send portions [of food to others] and to celebrate a great festival because they understood the words which had been [a]communicated to them.”     me:  When I read this I thought of the following:  When we pray listen read the Word love God obey Him and are caring and helpful to others we find joy and peace.  When we have joy and peace on the inside we are also strong and are not defeated by anything the world has to throw at us.  “…for the joy of the Lord is your strength and your stronghold.”   TAKE AWAY:  Holy Spirit helps us grow more like our Lord and Savior Jesus so we have more joy more peace!

I moved 2.5 hours north and left my career friends the only town I've ever known and changed my custody schedule of DD 15 and DS 14 to do so. My DH was overwhelmed had begun drinking and had every sign of depression. He is the love of my life and my true movation for being here was to save him part of the pain of it all. Since then FIL has fallen and hit his head a few times. Began meds for Parkinsons and has become hateful to me. He mocks me calls me names belittles me refers to me as the drill sergeant or nurse ratchet makes accusations and threats against my children and fights with any doctor/medical recommendation or plan. DH allows all of this. Says he's accepted what's going on with his dad - that his dad is gone already - and when I try to tell him what happened that day he says all I do is complain or be nasty. I have PTSD from a previous abusive marriage and have begun having panic attacks again. I cry multiple times a day. I started therapy but it's hard to follow any of her recommendations when I can't talk to DH. I feel like I'm stuck here at the house in jail. On top of all this the career I gave up was one of supervising caregivers for adults with mental challenges. I had over 20 clients with IQ scores beginning at 45 living in their own homes with 24/7 staff and assistance. They had jobs did chores social activities used public transportation etc. I was good at my job. But because I'm female FIL (a former world headquarter executive) sees me as a waitress. I'm here to cook and clean and whatever else he says when he says it. He thinks all women should be skinny with full makeup and dressed to the nines each day. He says women are dumb. He will sit in his chair and shout for me to bring the remote or a drink rather than making an attempt. He reads the paper each morning but doesn't comprehend it anymore. Other than that he has no routine. I've tried making one with ADL's (grooming showering) and he says it's trivial. Yet he refuses to do any of them. He wanders through the night. Moves from couch to couch. Refuses to go anywhere argues about PT. The house was evaluated for safety by an OT and the recommendations have gone ignored. Other than medications that I hand deliver every 4 hours he thinks all medical professional recommendations are irrelevant. (and they may be to a degree. I understand death will come but he's not cognitively unable to do them just refuses). He says he wants to do whatever to improve the deconditioning and difficulty with balance and standing. Yet refuses multiple times. He has grand ideas (for example wanting to go outside and paint the screened porch when it's 20 degrees) but won't attempt to get up and fill his glass from the faucet. He makes it so hard to even like him let alone be a loving caregiver.   Am I expecting too much? Should I try a schedule again?? Is it all me taking things personally? Am I just a selfish bit*#?

After 7 years of handling her business and health care I realized had to help her move to a safe environment because her dementia got too bad for her to live on her own.  I could go into a narrative that outlined and details everything I did to make sure she received the dignity of life she was entitled to it is the present situation that I am having a hard time with.  Now my mother is in a safe place my brother and his family are making themselves the grandstand people they are with inconveniencing the staff they are the ones that are incharge f her care.  My POA does not give them that right.  When I found out she had the flu this year and asked why they did not call me about giving her a flu shot like they did last year they told me my niece and nephew lived where she was.  Not good.  I went ballistics.  I hoped my brother and his family would visit my mother.  They never did when they could of helped her except try to get her home and make sure they would not have to be bothered with her care.  I covered my bases with the state she is in checks on her once a month and the friends she has that she was always in contact with continuously visit and tell me how she is doing.  I have used other resources to make sure the staff does not think my brother or his family are their contact point about her medical care.  What makes it hard for me is how I made sure my mother could live like she want with what she could afford with the best people to go to her home to accomplish that are now telling me to let what my brother is doing.  That it is my pride and I am not being the better person.  After my brother threatened my mother the police were called to report the incident.  Someone called elder abuse and they requested and investigation.  That is when I found out how horrible it all was when the social worker with the police department call me to tell me her report.  Boil it down yo what they told me..do not let you mother let your brother on her property.  I knew nothing about all of this.  An incident report was made.  For years after that my mother wanted nothing to do with my brother or his family.  She did not even believe he was her son.  the ultimate is she wanted me to promise he never even knew when she dies.  Now that her dementia is more advance they are taking advantage of her state of mine.  I know the grey areas of these kinds of situations.  It has just been so hard for me to accept the nature of these people playing their last play to grandstand they are the big deal of a loving and devoted family that I know is not all about how they feel about my mother.  There is no monetary gain for them.  The thing that they wanted all along her stuff and control.   I will not accept that this type of person or family thinks they are able to just interfere with my legal right to make decisions about her health care.  Why can some people just not be normal without the pain they constantly cause the people they impose themselves on.

I have a lot on my plate and just got laid off from my job in the middle of buying a house. My daughter is in physical therapy for her ankle (she is a soccer player one kick to the ankle and that was it for now.) I have been seeing a physical therapist for pain in my shoulder/arm/neck the cause is unknown I will be having a MRI done here soon.   With all of that going on my MIL is going through what I can only describe as irregular mood swings? I have a dementia program set up for her and a Nurse Physical Therapist Occupational Therapist and a Speech Therapist come out at least once a week and while they are here my MIL does fine has somewhat of a conversation and is willing to engage and participate in the daily tasks they ask her to do. Once they are gone and we are left to do these routines all MIL wants to do is disappear into her room to ""read her book"" which she has been asked to do at the table to help with her muscles and to keep her up and active so she does not become bed ridden. It seems all she wants to do is sleep and read.      Today: I knew she would not remember we had places to go however she was woken up 3 different times and even got up to pee but ended up back in bed. Finally when I refused to leave the room and told her we had places to go she finally got up. When I asked her why she wouldn't get up the only thing she had to say was ""I was tired"" and ""well I was sleeping so good"" (not in the nicest way more like a teenager that has an attitude.)   It only got worse from there I tried to get her involved and asked her to help clean off the table. She basically stood there and stared at myself and my daughter as we cleaned it. She even said she ""forgot"" where the bananas go so she just left them on the stove. I honestly don't think she ""forgot"" where they go. She also told my sister and brother in-law that I was mean because I wouldn't let her ask them for a ""drag"" of their cigarettes. (we have designated times for her cigarettes.) She still asks my husband and whomever else smokes for ""just a drag"" even if she has just had one.   I was overwhelmed and completely irritated not just by her actions today but it has been building up with everything else going on. I had to get out of the house. I was so mad and irritated and impatient I felt like I was going to blow a gasket. I am usually the calmest most understanding person out of the whole families.. mine and my husbands. Today I broke. I left. My mom was there and my husband was getting off of work. So she was never alone I just couldn't do it anymore for the day. I was spent. I was exhausted and overwhelmed.   I just wanted to know and let people know that they are not alone and I hope I am not either.

She sat down with him gave him a coffee and moved his wheelchair to look out the window (he's at a nursing home now). As they were sitting there he pointed to his head (he does this to tell us something is wrong with his brain) and he looked at her with tears building up in his eyes.   It hurts to much to listen to my mother tell me these things especially because my family is in new york and I am in Miami. I feel so helpless down here.   I grew up without a father so my grandfather and I have always been so close. He was an alcoholic my moms entire childhood so I was truly his second chance at fatherhood - we were absolute best friends. I just don't know how to deal with this pain. Its been 10 years since his diagnosis and it is to the point where he no longer speaks and we believe he forgot how to walk now as well. I am broken. I just need someone to talk to besides my mom.

195,62102ed9c9f833c0c9214753,2147538917,2018-01-22 19:21:00,Here we go again(4),"I guess things had been too quiet too long.  This afternoon I got a frantic phone message at work from my ex-husband telling me he had been walking for THREE HOURS (I seriously doubt it was that long but we've had snow and it was cold today) and was in grocery store but he didn't know where he was or how to get back to the facility and wanted me to get the situation taken care of. He didn't know the name of the facility or their phone number (which has been programmed into his phone). Apparently by the time I got the message and returned his call someone at the store had found the ICE number on his phone and had contacted the facility and someone was going to go and pick him up and bring him back.  My problem is this: WHY IS HE BEING ALLOWED TO SIGN HIMSELF OUT AND GO ON THESE WALKABOUTS? He was in the assisted living section of the facility but now that he has gotten a neurologist's diagnosis of FTD and korsakoff's syndrome with moderate to severe symptoms why is the facility still letting him sign himself out?  I have a phone call in to the manager of the facility (he was already gone; this happened fairly late this afternoon) and want to discuss this situation with him and find out why they are still taking the stance that my ex ""is his own person and can sign himself out if he wants to"". I do not have POA but the facility itself has temporary POA for him. Aren't they putting themselves in the hot seat if they keep allowing this to go on? This is the second time within a month that he has been walking far from the facility because he is allowed to come and go pretty much at will.  I have not yet reported this situation to the Ombudsman or the state but I think I would be within my rights as his ex wife to do that even tho I don't have POA or guardianship for him (and don't want it). But I'm at least acting in his best interest and I'm not that sure that the staff at that facility is. He has been a royal pain in the a$$ to them the entire time he's been there insisting they ""don't do anything for him"" because he thinks he's in a treatment facility of some sort and is mad that he's not receiving whatever treatment he thinks he deserves. He had gone to the grocery store because he told me that they don't feed him (they do. He gets 3 meals a day plus snacks) and when I told him that he started in on his rant again about how they don't know what they're doing and he hasn't gotten any treatment there and blah blah blah.   My question is what do I say to the facility manager tomorrow when I talk to him? I don't know what it's going to take for them to understand that he is not making reasonable rational decisions regarding his own well-being and they are supposed to be responsible for his care while he's living there. With his formal diagnosis I can't understand why they are allowing him to still come and go at will and since this is the second time in less than a month that he's gotten lost outside their facility I think they need to impose more restrictions on him.   I believe I can call an Ombudsman and a state agency that oversees care facilities and report this but I'm not sure how to find out who the Ombudsman is or how to contact the office or the what state agency would be involved if I have to escalate this complaint. I'm hoping this situation has shocked them enough to throw some fear into their decision-makers and they will reconsider allowing him to go on walkabouts at will any more. It's winter here and icy and it represents a disaster waiting to happen now. They've had two warnings already. I hope he won't have to be sacrificed before they realize they need to up their oversight of him.   I could use ideas about what to say what to ask them about what their parameters for no longer allowing someone to come and go at will and how to impress on their staff that I mean it and will call authorities if this is allowed to continue. I think I'm within my rights to report the situation to the authorities even tho I'm not his guardian and don't have POA but am acting to protect his well being. I would do it for a stranger if I thought the stranger was being harmed and needed help so I don't think only someone with POA can report a problem do they? Has anybody had to report a problem with a facility before? What do you have to do? Is there a chain of command that you have to report it to? Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

Shehated the place and everything you said about how it affected your mother thatshow it affected my wife.   As far as the not eating and goingto the bath room that’s the way my wife was and she lasted for 3 months on justliquids my only concern for her was that she was not in pain and wascomfortable.

197,62102f07c9f833c0c92148c4,2147549434,2019-10-22 07:37:00,I'm new here having a hard time.,My name is Char and my mom was diagnosed back in 2015 when a CT scan showed indentations in her frontal lobe. She has been doing pretty well since then with only a few signs that she has this illness.  In July she broke her pelvis in 2 places. At first while under heavy sedation she didn't know who I was. As the pain meds decreased her mind came back to where she was prior to the fall.   She went home for two days after recovering and fell again in the 1 hour gap between her aides being there. That happened a month ago this Friday. She knows who I am now but that's it. I go to see her almost every day and have to explain where she is and what happened. Every day I get calls from her begging and crying for me to get her out of there. Last night she wanted me to give her her mother's phone number and I had to tell her her mom has been dead for 25 years. Which of course set her off on a crying jag and I eventually had to hang up.  When she got diagnosed I made sure to be added to her accounts and became her health proxy and also obtained a Durable Power of Attorney. I'm good at that kind of thing. What I'm not good at is lying and hanging up on my mother. I feel so guilty and so useless and don't know how to handle this kind of thing. This is why I'm here. I've looked over a few posts so far but I look forward to getting to know more people here and providing support for them when I can.   Any help or advice you can give would be appreciated.,False,Charrlygirl,2019-10-21,7.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549434,,,AlzConnected,,,

She resides in a memory care unit for the last 1.5 years. For the last three months of visits she is more calm and more cognitively aware and more bright eyed. She is currently mostly wheelchair bound.    Her nurse in the unit states that about 3 days a week she is very restless and agitated and just will not settle down all day long. Theyve recently adjusted her meds and she seems to be somewhat better.   I realize this is probably due to her being uncomfortable or in pain but her nurse says shes in her last stage of alzheimers however my mother still feeds herself and is able to make her needs known - hunger toileting thirst sleep bedtime etc. She doesnt remember most of us now but comes around eventually to knowing who we are. And shes got a great sense of humor and when she gets aggressive and agitated she will eventually apologize later. This is all so perplexing and befuddling.

Mom 92 in MC fell (again) this past Sunday. The facility broke all their promises and called 911 then me and then (perhaps) hospice. The result was of course I had to leave work to meet the ambulance at ER.   We don't mind the fall. We'd told the companions that if Mom fell asleep they could sneak to the bathroom. She did she did then she (Mom) woke up and headed out sans walker to find whatever was missing. She apparently made it 10 feet to the doorway but fell at the bedside table bonking her head twice twisting some I guess and landing on her right side (the one with the 3-month-old bionic hip naturally. Prostheses in my family are gravity magnets!)  Nothing broken but plenty of pain waited until 2:00am for a transport to become free etc etc you know the drill.   Tuesday morning Mom was briefly without a private pay or family member in her room and staff decided that she ""seemed to want to get up"". Disaster I arrive we continue to mop up the mess.   Sometimes she's somewhat clear most times not at all but will converse. Her companion this afternoon said they had a good visit. When Bro was here she was just post-evacuation and unrestful. Maybe we need more companions and less us.....  Meanwhile I sit here and try to decide about the next dose of morphine -- should I get it before supper (now) or wait an hour and a half.   Oh VERY interesting. She just said something I went ""hmmm?) and she said as clearly as her desiccated mouth will allow no I was talking to her!  Would love to know who her was this time.   Her vitals continue strong but her poor brain is flopping around. I'd figured she might bounce back especially once the digestive distress was relieved but the future is obscured as always.   I am sad for my failure to be able to understand what's in her head. Of course there is a disease but Dorothy Ann is still right there trying to get out/go home/whatever.   This is as good a place as any to say THANK YOU  to all the stage 8-ers who continue to viskt and offer their warmth and expertise.   ""Oh! Did you say something to her?!"" Me: no I'm listening to this music aren't the peolle singing nice? (turn hymns up a bit).

But I am feeling mighty sorry for all the caregivers on this forum who struggle with that awful feeling so I'm sending this old post to the top (ttt.)    Guilt puts a knot in your stomach and a pain in your chest.  It tightens up your throat and stings your eyes.  It keeps you up at night and erodes your ability to concentrate.  But grief anxiety fear and stress can create those   same physical sensations.    How do we figure out what is causing those terrible feelings?   I believe many caregivers mistakenly attribute all unpleasant feelings to ""guilt.""  It especially happens when we are caring for a parent because our parents are the ones who taught us right from wrong.  Guilt springs from knowing that you are ""breaking the rules"" and Mom &amp; Dad were our original rule-makers.  Please fellow ""guilty"" caregivers ask yourself what rule you are breaking in the care of your LO????  I found a nice little exercise about unmasking guilt on this website:  http://misteriopress.com/2012/11/did-your-mom-give-you-the-look/  After a little introspection some of you may decide that you are NOT ""guilty"" of anything at all.  Maybe you are afraid stressed lonely confused overwhelmed or anxious.  Those are all horrible feelings but they do not make you a ""bad person.""  Cut yourself some slack.  Forgive yourself for your shortcomings and forgive your LO for their their illness.  Forgiveness will bring calm to you and your loved ones.  This is a tough road.

I also understand that giving her the care she needs in my home while caring for my own children etc. was more than I could sustain.   On an emotional level I find it to be a daunting task to go through everything from my parents' house while she is alive.  So I am reaching out to the wisdom of the group.   Is it correct that I should not return to the house for a visit with her?  This would lead to nothing but upset and pain for her right?   As none of us do I have no idea how many years she will live with this disease.  I need to use her house either as a rental or for sale to support her care.  I know the logical answers yet I think what I'm asking for is insight about how you may have made the process of sorting and getting rid of things easier or more bearable under these circumstances.,False,Bakelite1,2018-12-26,23.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547880,,,AlzConnected,,,

I go to all the weddings funerals holiday gatherings etc.  My parents adore him too and he always sends them birthday cards and has dinner with us when they visit.  D and I are very different in a lot of ways but there is a bond of friendship and love which holds us together.  We were roommates at one point and I do still miss living with him even though he was loud and messy.       D is 54 and not in great health.  Lately I've been noticing his memory is going and I see him making poor decisions.  The stupidest one recently was walking my dog without a leash on a busy road.  Needless to say I was really upset.  We share a cell phone plan (it's cheaper that way) and I had to start paying him through my bank rather than giving him cash because when I paid him in cash he'd forget and accuse me of not paying him.   He also has this mean streak which is coming out- the other day he told me he was looking for a photo of me from when I ""used to be hot"".  And he thinks I am uptight- when he comes to visit he wants to go out and keep drinking and I refuse to leave my doors unlocked for him to wander back here at some crazy hour.  I did give him a set of keys (we've always had spare keys to each other's homes) and he promptly lost them so his way of dealing is to yell at me and criticize me for wanting to keep my doors locked.   It makes me sad to see my friend changing and I know his body has taken a beating from a lifetime of physical labor.  He drinks a lot because he is often in pain- he still works 6 days a week as a chef I don't know how he does it.  When he drinks he makes stupid choices and often falls down- it has become such a common theme unfortunately.  He did mention trying to get some CBD for body pain which I think is an excellent idea.    I guess it's hard for me to see a peer aging- and it feels like life went by so fast-  just a couple of years ago we'd be making plans for fun summer road trips - now when we go out I almost have to babysit him to make sure he doesn't get too drunk and do stupid things.  And of course I worry about his memory and just wonder what's going to happen if it gets worse.     I don't know if there are really any answers I just feel sad that my life has changed so much I feel exhausted from taking care of myself and then also of the closest people to me- him and my parents.  And sometimes it feels like no one really takes care of me . . . I suppose I'm feeling like this even more so because I had a car accident a couple of weeks ago and it made me feel incredibly vulnerable- and am still dealing with all the practicalities as well as waiting for bruises to heal.",False,Livesbythebeach,2019-04-03,249.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547858,,,AlzConnected,,,
205,62102fc7c9f833c0c9214ecd,2147547874,2019-07-08 04:03:00,urgently need advice,"I urgently need help making a decision tomorrow. Some background then the question:    I was caregiving for my mom for 6 months in my home following onset of dementia. I transferred her to a care facility at the end of January when her care needs exceeded my capacity - primarily when she started waking up howling each night and I could never get back to sleep. There were repeated issues of poor care at the facility the result of a robotic cookie-cutter approach with a lack of skill for dementia patients. That facility is 5-stars and appeared to be as good as it gets without private pay which was not an option given finances. So I did my best to make it work at the facility - speaking with all the leadership repeatedly (there were some improvements but otherwise the same issues ongoing) and ultimately hiring a private companion for my mom at the facility.     Just 2-3 weeks before I found the companion my mom unraveled - first she couldn't walk literally overnight then she couldn't eat solid food then she couldn't feed herself. I ended up going back and forth to the facility 5 times a week (previously had been going 3 times a week) - a 5 hour round trip each time - to ensure that my mother was properly cared for. One week into having the private companion onboard my mom suddenly went comatose and was rushed to the hospital. Turned out she had a UTI. She arrived mute and remained mute for two weeks except for the occasional ""yes"" ""no"" or ""OK.""    The hospital was outstanding. I ensured that my mother was on IV fluids because she has a pattern of never drinking enough fluids to stay hydrated even in the best of circumstances. Knowing she was on IV fluids and seeing that the nurses were dialed into my mom and using sneaky tricks to get her to eat  among other things I was confident in her care and possibility of rehabilitating. Because the care was so good I had the companion visit my mother most of the time and saw it as a vacation to get my own life back together. Among other considerations I hadn't been sleeping well; my business had unraveled leaving me living off of credit cards; and I had not been practicing self-care at the level that I need for my own wellness. However my mother stopped eating - I think out of protest. She gets very upset when people turn her/change her without communicating along the way - ie breaking down everything they are doing and going very slowly and being very kind and personable. She's totally right of course but the weapon she uses to fight back - which she also used at the care facility - is self-sabotage ie refusing to let someone change her or feed her or whatever. Then I need to come to the rescue.  Anyhow my plan initiatlly was to have her transfered from the hospital to another care facility one closer to my home. But the discharge office cast the net wide and only came up with one option at a care facility that was a s*** hole. I could not let my mom go into a situation like that. So I decided to bring her back home on hospice and to have the hospice social worker immediatley start looking for other options - ie so that the arrangement would be temporary.  Meanwhile my mom had stopped eating and drinking at the hospital and a wise friend advised me to allow her to transition naturally. I was adamant that I would not let her die as a result of the stupidity and incompetency of that previous care facility. My friend asked how I would be responding to the situation if that variable were removed - ie if my mom had stopped eating and drinking but without that cause involved. I said I would switch gears to being loving and supportive in her transition instead of pushing her to eat and drink. My friend advised that I do just that ie switch gears to allowing my mother to transition. She said that while my mother may be saying she wants to stay alive her body is saying otherwise. I said ok and did in fact switch gears. I started sleeping at the hospital and ultimately at a hotel nearby (because she hollers at night) and spending all day by her side holding her singing to her playing drums for her and talking to/with her. The IV had stopped working by early this past week and I decided not to have another port put in because I was taking this comfort-not-cure approach.   But then my mother's soul bypassed the dementia and she made it very clear (speaking in full sentences) that she wanted to live. I said that would mean she would need to eat and drink. She said she would do that. And indeed she did following our conversation. So I had the IV fluids reinstated to give her a fighting chance to bounce back. I also stalled on hospital discharge - they hadn't found a state caregiver anyhow and I couldn't find someone to offer the support (everyone I had hired previously had moved on). My mom did in fact bounce back which made me so very happy. The light came back in her eyes and the smile back on her face. And she started speaking in full sentences routinely and drinking with a straw (which she had stopped being able to do) and then even grasping her cup while I was holding it to her face - wanting to do it herself.  Here's where I am now: The port went bad again this morning. I got the doctor to authorize another one. The nurses didn't put it in despite repeatedly telling me they were doing it. Then the night shift nurse said she was given instructions not to put in a new port because discharge was planning on releasing my mom tomorrow. Meanwhile I haven't gotten word from them that they have found a state caregiver - in fact they haven't responded at all to my message from Friday. It's going to be insanely intense for me to care for my mom alone in particular because I have an extremely sensitive back and can't do heavy lifting. My mom currently can't stand or even sit on her own. So changing and cleaning her is going to be hell. In addition if she comes home now she will not be able to continue having the benefit of the IV fluids. And the support of the hospital staff is incredible - my mom has been in and out of hospitals for 11 years and this is hands down the best EVER.  But hospitals and insurance are run by profit and my mom officially has been medically stable for two weeks though its actually untrue. Her condition has CHANGED. And while the doctor agrees with me he thinks we'll encounter resistance from the hospital - as obviously has happened going against the doctor's orders to have the port reinstated.  Because it was already 9:30 pm when I found out what had gone down with the port and because I didn't want to cause my mom unnecessary pain in case the discharge planners had in fact found a state caregiver meaning that she will be going home tomorrow I didn't insist that the port be put in. Instead I pushed my mom into drinking about 70 ml of fluid in addition to the 1/2 cup from the afternoon. Not a lot but something.   My questions are as follows:  1. Do I bring my mom home if the hospital hasn't found a state caregiver - ie if it's all on me (with the execption of one private caregiver who can help in the evening)? Or do I fight it?  2. Is it better for my mom to be in my home (where she has now on two occasions gone from being incapacitated to being rehabilitated) or is it better for her to be at the hospital on the IV fluids? For a long time she has resisted drinking or eating as much as is healthy but it's never been this bad in the past - ie not drinking or eating *at all*. While she initially was gung-ho about eating it's been a major effort since. I've been pushing her because she says she wants to live and I have wanted to at least give her a running start while at the hospital - with the idea being that once I bring her home I won't push anymore but allow her to eat/drink or not and therefore live or not according to what her body does.   3. Does the hospital have the legal right to discharge my mom without having a state caregiver in place at my home? Keep in mind there is that s***hole care facility that has accepted my mom so they could say they have done due diligence finding a place for her even as a temporary solution.   4. If I refuse to take my mom prior to having a state caregiver and refuse to allow her to go to the s***hole and the hospital starts billing my mom can that end up my financial responsibility? My mom literally has nothing so if they only come after here who cares. But I don't want my finances getting tangled with hers because while I have a massive debt and very little cash flow at the moment I do own a house.   Thanks for your insights.",False,pearlhansen,2018-11-18,104.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547874,,,AlzConnected,,,

Oh My!,"The last 10 days have been a nightmare.  Dad (85 years old with moderate dementia) fell and split his head open.  He was rushed to the ER.  We were there for 8 hours or so.  That's when we got the horrible news that Dad has brain cancer.  I had so many decisions to make so quickly.  I decided no brain surgery no radiation and no chemo.  I took Dad home and hired 24-hour home health workers.   I made the decision to focus only on comfort care and pain management.  The next day we started hospice.  Yesterday and today the pain was so intense we started him on morphine.    Ten days ago Dad was walking unaided.  Now he uses a walker and still needs a person to help.  He can only walk a few steps with the walker.  He has no sense of balance.  The doctor says he will not recover his balance.  Ten days ago Dad was living fairly independently in a retirement community with me going by for 3-4 hours a day.  Now he needs 24-hour nurses there and still needs me for most of the day.  Ten days ago Dad was on no pain medication.  Now he's taking morphine frequently.    Ten days ago Dad could get in and out of a chair unaided.  Now he needs a lift chair and an aid to help him.    I've tried to stay strong -- for him.  In reality I'm exhausted and overwhelmed.  I've had to miss a lot of work and my job is in jeopardy.  I'm single so I rely on my job -- it's the only income I have.  When Dad was hospitalized I called my brother to tell him what happened.  He lives 12 hours away.  When we started hospice I called him again.  He said over and over how glad he was that Dad had me and that he agreed with all my decisions.  I called him Friday night and he didn't take my call.  He never called me back.  I saw him online and said ""Hello"" but he never responded.  I saw him online several more times but he never messaged me.  I didn't think much about it.  Today while I was at Dad's I picked up Dad's phone and called my brother. I wanted to tell him we had started Dad on morphine.   He answered immediately.  I asked him about his family -- just some quick small talk.  I didn't mention the earlier phone call or online message.  He said I know  you called Friday but I was at a party and it wasn't convenient to take your call.  I said That's no problem.  He said I know you messaged me but I've been very busy. (He takes a vacation almost every month.)   Again I said No problem.  He then said his life is very busy right now and he just can't deal ""with this"" right now.  He said he knew Dad was in good hands with me to do whatever I think is best and that he'd call me ""sometime.""  Then he hung up.  I know I won't hear from him again until I have to call him to tell him that Dad passed.  He did this 10 years ago when I did hospice with my mother who had cancer.  I took a 3 month leave of absence from work and moved down to my mom's house -- did 24 hour care myself because I promised her she could die at home.  Mom was calling for him but he wouldn't come to visit.  He said he couldn't handle seeing her ""like that.""  He did show up for the funeral.  I know I shouldn't have expected his help but somehow I still did.  Now I'm feeling very alone and overwhelmed.  I have absolutely no one to turn to.  I spend almost every waking hour with Dad but when I come home to sleep I get woken up by calls from the caregivers and call-backs from the emergency hospice nurse. I know with time we will get his pain under control but until then I'm a walking zombie.      I considered putting Dad in skilled nursing but they said with his dementia and uncontrolled pain he'd still need 24 hour personal aides in addition to the skilled nursing.  He's not eligible for medicaid yet.    I feel like I'm running out of options I'm definitely running out of money.  Mostly I'm running out of energy.

MARION MASS MD      |   PHYSICIAN    |   APRIL 17 2016      338 SHARES           Share              Tweet              Share        I dialed the number to return the call of the nursing home. The nurse who answered the phone was relieved to hear my voice on the other line: “Dr. Mass thank God you called back! She has been pacing since she woke up and she refuses to take her meds. We’ve kept her away from Catherine so they don’t get into another fistfight. But we can’t handle her here anymore. We think we might have to send her to a psych unit and we need you to come help.”  “I’ll be right there.” The Alzheimer’s patient we were discussing was in prime physical shape for a woman her age but cognitively she was in the worst shape of anyone on her unit. Since the degenerative disease began laying claim to her brain we had witnessed her personality change drastically as the once-dedicated altruist became more and more prone to violent outbursts. The woman didn’t recognize any of her 5 kids who regularly visited and though she hadn’t been informed of the recent death of her husband of more than 5 decades (she couldn’t process the information) I suspected that on some level she was aware and her current behavior was the only way she could grieve.          And this hurt me to my core. Because she wasn’t just any patient in fact she wasn’t my patient at all. She was my mother.            By the time I arrived at the nursing home the staff had contacted the only hospital in the area with an opening in their geriatric psych unit which was over an hour away. As I helped the nurse calm down my mother who was agitatedly pacing the room I reflected on my mother’s life.  I need to stop to explain the pain that you have as a child in this situation. I had watched with bewilderment as my beloved once the ultra-capable mom who raised five kids and volunteered tirelessly for her community became more and more crippled by the disease that had hit in her late 70s. As her only daughter my mother and I had a sacred relationship and she was once the closest woman on the planet to me. It is nearly impossible to describe the pain and anguish that I felt when I looked into those eyes that held so many happy memories for me and saw only anger and fear.        It was up to the staff to help prepare my mother for the trip to the hospital but I knew that even under the best circumstances going to a new place would be a mini-horror for her. Alzheimer’s patients crave stability and routine. We had been incredibly lucky to find a stable calming environment in the nursing home where the staff truly cared for her and I was hopeful that she would continue to experience the same level of quality care and compassion at the accepting hospital.  Following procedure they first brought my mother to the ER of the accepting hospital where she tried to beat up the large male nurse. She was quickly sedated by the ER staff who called the Geriatric-psych unit — but the unit refused to accept her telling us “It is our administrative policy to not take patients with any form of dementia.”   Medical breakdown #1:          Hospitals have layers of administrators that do little to improve patient care and a lot to bog down the system. Since 1970 the number of physician caregivers has increased by 50 percent. During that same time  the number of health care administrators has grown by over 3000 percent . Of course we need administrators in the system but I think most would agree that a 3000 percent increase seems excessive. Aside from the financial burden of paying all those additional salaries there is little evidence to show that this dramatic increase in administrators is actually improving patient care. If anything it seems that superfluous hospital administrations could potentially corrode patient care by creating unnecessary rules and arbitrary bylaws: case in point the administrative policy to exclude dementia patients from the geriatric psych unit.   I knew that Mom needed her medication to be adjusted so my siblings and I appealed to the hospital to admit her to a regular medical ward with a psych consult.   Medical breakdown #2:    Being a medical professional myself I knew what to say to the hospital staff to ensure my mother would get appropriate treatment. Not all patients do.  Had I not spoken up she would have been sent back to her institution likely gotten agitated again and required a second ambulance ride/ER visit etc. That would have been wasteful of resources.  Decisions like this end up costing us millions but they continue to happen every single day.   The next day I arrived at the hospital with coffee and chocolates in hand knowing that Mom would get better care if her nurses and doctors were plied with caffeine. When I got to her room my mother was wearing only a diaper and restraints. Her breakfast tray sat untouched. I left the room sat in the hall and cried.        Once I composed myself I went to the nurses station where I found two medical students chatting between text messages.  “My Mom is in restraints. Can you help me move her so I can feed her breakfast?”  The students barely glanced up stated ‘it’s not our job’ and went back to their phones.   Medical breakdown #3:    Effective health care is almost always the result of a team working together to help a patient. Our current health system breeds the mentality that one can never ever deviate from their individual job description even if it is in the best interest of the patient. Perhaps these two students would have incurred reprimanding for stepping outside the scope of their job but at the very least they could have found someone to help. Following the rulebook has become more important than helping the patient.   Luckily for me a nurse overheard our conversation and came to help move my mother. After helping Mom finish her breakfast I waited to speak with her physician. My mother had only ever been treated by people that knew and cared about her so I wanted to tell the doctor about her in the hopes that they would see her as a person instead of just a patient.   Medical breakdown #4:    The best medical care particularly in primary care happens when doctors know their patients  because they truly care for them . This happens naturally when patients are able to see the same physicians and doctors have time to spend with those patients. Our current system has handicapped the patient-physician relationship overwhelming physicians with far too many patients each day and reducing the amount of time spent with each one. Sadly the doctors at this hospital were more interested in punching their time clock than they were in building relationships with patients but given their highly regulated work environment I can hardly blame them.   I spoke with the doctors about my mother’s medication adjustment and requested an x-ray of her hand which was bruised and swollen (battle scar from her fight with the ER nurse). It took three days for them to get the x-ray. I was told that this delay was due to a problem with the computer order reaching radiology.   Medical breakdown #5:    The electronic health record (EHR) is a subject that could be written about in great length (in fact it has been. Often.). In 2009 the federal government mandated all hospitals and offices to become computer compliant — but as anyone who has ever used a computer can tell you there are always glitches. How would you feel if you or a loved one missed a dose of important medication because of a glitch? For my mother at least this was not a fatal computer glitch. But even if computers operated perfectly their omnipresence in patient care settings has further depersonalized medicine as nurses and doctors no longer interact with the patient but sit in front of a screen for hours clicking on boxes.   Three days later the hospital was ready to release my Mom and my brother and I arrived at the hospital that Saturday to find our mother unresponsive. It didn’t require a medical professional to guess why: dry lips dry tongue and skin tenting — she was clearly suffering from the effects of dehydration. I immediately went to the nurse’s station and demanded to know how much fluid Mom had received in the past three days. The nurse wrestled with the computer for forty minutes to get the information (aren’t EHRs great?). After another forty minutes waiting for the nurse to get the printer working I insisted on seeing the computer itself.  Thirteen ounces.  My mother had gotten thirteen ounces of fluid in three days.  That amounts to a can of soda.   Medical breakdown #6:    Where do I even begin — this was not a single mistake but shift after shift of neglect from various staff members. Where was the care in this health care system? How could a prominent hospital forget to do the most basic thing; i.e. provide water for my Mom?   I told the nurse to send the doctor and prepare paperwork for an against-medical-advice (AMA) discharge because I would be taking my Mom to a hospital we could trust and from there back to the nursing home once we had her hydrated. The supervising physician and nurse were shocked and apologetic when I explained the situation and offered to get an ambulance to transport my mom.  My brother and I declined and carried our mother tenderly into the backseat of our own car.   Medical breakdown #7 avoided:    For all intents and purposes my mother my Mom was a terminal patient. We would be wasting a valuable and expensive resource by having a potentially lifesaving EMT crew spend three hours transporting her. So much time and money is wasted in medicine in instances where common sense should rule.   We drove our mother back to her local ER at the hospital where she had been going for 35 years and where she was well-known. As I told the staff there of our experience at the previous hospital they looked as shocked as I felt. They cared for her kindly and respectfully and we got her tucked into the memory unit that had become home. It took about a week before she was awake and a month before she regained what was about 75 percent of her former strength.  Two days after we took our mother back to the nursing home I received an apologetic call from the hospital administrators who I could tell were squirming with fear of a possible lawsuit even over the phone. I said very little. I had no desire to feed the parasitic beast of  malpractice litigation . The lawsuit itself would have cost tens of thousands of dollars and even a cash-filled victory would have brought little comfort or sense of justice to my family. Personally we cannot comprehend equating money with quality of life.  But I couldn’t do nothing. I contacted the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Joint Commission and launched investigations and inspections upon the hospital giving them detailed accounts of what had happened. After several months we were again contacted by the hospital’s administrators and assured that they had implemented changes to prevent such problems to future patients.  It was a small comfort that we enacted some changes.  That comfort was short-lived. About a year later I got a call from a friend whose Alzheimer’s-ridden mother had been hospitalized with pneumonia. She was concerned about her mother’s level of care who had started developing bed sores and whose condition seemed to be declining every day. She was dismayed watching her mother deteriorate under the care of the hospital staff who were reluctant to give any clear answers and gave her trouble when she tried to reach the physicians. I gave my friend some suggestions and asked what hospital her mother was at. Can you guess what her answer was? It was the same hospital where my mother had been so mistreated the same one where two government agencies had investigated the same hospital that had supposedly changed their ways.  This is only one story of the sad state of today’s health system. Mom’s substandard level of care happened in a setting of good resources at a highly regarded institution with a physician daughter advocating on her behalf. Imagine what happens to the advocate-less indigent in poorly funded hospitals. If we do not change our current trajectory to fix our health care system scenarios like my mother’s will become commonplace the quality of care will implode and the financial burden on our country will wreck us. I fear for the future.  Last April my mother suffered a bad fall and fractured her vertebrae and ribs. She developed pneumonia and cried piteously in pain. Our family elected to place her on hospice at the nursing home with comfort meds only. My brothers and I sat at her bedside while all the nurses who had treated her not just as a patient but cared for her as a person came in and wept over her impending death. It made us feel grateful beyond imagination to witness firsthand the personal loving care she had been receiving. All of our collective hands cared for her in her final days and I was at her side for her final breath just as she was with me for my first.

I came in (from my 200 mule traffic-snarled trip) to find my mother on the bedroom floor. Aide described a mishap with the Hoyer lift and a controlled descent to the floor. No visible injury mom is fairly good spirits with not a clue she was on the floor no complaint of pain. I called the local firehouse for a lift assist; they responded swiftly and got her on the bed. Their help was invaluable.  On the plus side in a way it is a blessing that the dementia is so advanced. A year ago Mom would have been screaming bloody murder about being dumped on the floor. And aide did not panic. On the minus side my mother was on the floor and the person the agency sent us did not operate the lift correctly.   I myself want to lay on the floor and cry.,False,Iamnumberfour,2016-02-29,1265.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147542613,,,AlzConnected,,,
210,62103019c9f833c0c921517f,2147545247,2019-01-12 18:36:00,PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND.,"I have no one else I can talk with that maybe can understand what i'm going through. My beautiful mom is 70 years old. She has been diagnosed with Dementia due to Alzheimer's. She has lived with me and my wife and three kids age 20 14 and 9 for the past two and half years. First allow me to talk about my mom and help you all that may read this understand her better. My mom is the oldest female of eight brothers and sisters. She was born in California and raised my brother and I there as well. My father was very abusive and a cheater I am the oldest brother. After my mom finally gained the strength and left him because he nearly killed her by trying to break her neck slamming her head over the edge of a bathtub. She left him and ended up with the father of my younger brother. Who ended being a drug addict. Who would steal from my mother steal her entire hard earned paycheck disappear for days then come back broke no money and beg her forgiveness. Her with him was the endless cycle that was endured until I left home at age seventeen because I could no longer bear it nor could I continue to witness it. My mother has never smoked drank done drugs in all of her life. She has lived a life of honor and has given to all when they needed even if she had nothing she would give the shirt off her back. She worked in Los Angeles for big attorneys as a paralegal for over thirty years. She made good money worked hard and did her best for my brother and I. With out the help or structure of any man. My mother and I have not always saw eye to eye and when I left home our relationship was estranged due mainly because I did not agree with her choosing to continue being with my brothers drug addict father. One who also abused me sexually. The things I write here are subjects I have never spoken about with anyone not even my mother but yesterday was the hardest day of my life dealing with my mothers Dementia Alzheimer's. I will explain that later in my plea.  Now I'm 46 years of age. My mother and I went many years with only sparse conversations. Holidays birthdays grandchildren accomplishments that sort of thing. After nearly all her life in California my mother retired and retreated to the family land in Mccomb Ms. I later come to learn the reason for is because she was evicted from her home lost her job and had no where else to go. While living in the family property of which her mother and my grandmother had purchased her other brothers and sisters all signed documents and had her evicted from the property because they choose to sell it and divide up the money between them. Forcing my mother again to uproot and relocate to Florida where she moved in with an older cousin of hers. Whom after a sort period kicked my mother out on the streets and she ended up in a woman homeless shelter. All of this was unbeknownst to me at the time. My mother was left to decay away in a homeless shelter by her brothers and sisters my youngest brother who has also become a drug addict like his father before him. Everyone knew my mother was in a homeless shelter. I would call my mother monthly on her cell phone talk with her and everything would seem normal I would invite to come for the holidays and she would always decline and never told me she was in a homeless shelter. Now I understand why. It was her mental disease. Of which all my aunts and uncles knew she had but no one ever said anything to me. They only used her for her SSI of $1300 per month. Never took her to the doctor never to the dentist never took care of her period. Two and a half years ago one of my aunts sent me a message on facebook she was dying of cancer. She told me she did not want what they did to my mother on her conscious and told me my mom was in a homeless shelter and that my mom was mentally sick. I immediately went into rage found out where my mother was and two days later I had arranged for my mother to be flown here to me in Texas.  The day she arrived in at the airport in Houston was another one of the most stressful days of my life. Because my mom never came down to baggage claim to meet me. Instead she walked off the plane went out and took a cab to downtown Houston. I know this because for five hours HPD and myself walked all over the airport until finally they checked all the cameras and traced her movements. The police department ended up finding out the company that drove her found out where she was driven to and the search began again from that area. We could not put out a silver alert because she had not yet been diagnosed with the illness. Cheers to all my brothers and sisters in blue. We found my mom after a total of seven hours siting on a bus stop in the middle of the night crying. Thank God. Since all of this my mother has lived with my family and I. It was not really bad in the beginning she actually seemed quite normal unless you really knew her then you would not be able to tell something was a little off with her. There was one other time when she wondered away from our home and the deputies found her six hours later eight miles from my home. They found her with the bird in the sky. Since then my house has basically become her prison. I have installed cameras made all the exit doors key required exits. put locks on all the drawers turn off the gas to the stove every night because these are all accidents that have happened. I have woken up to a house full of gas smell due to the pilot just clicking releasing gas woken up to her standing in the dark in a corner in the kitchen with a knife in her hand saying no one will steal her money it has come tot he point of I have no idea what more I can do for her. I love my mom very much and I want the best for her but I am truly lost in what to do. This brings me to yesterday. My mom has reached the point where she can no longer use the restroom responsibly. She will urinate and release number 2 on herself. In her clothes on the floor. She has become violent and very foul language around my kids and my wife. My wife has decided to leave me. She states that she can not handle nor deal with my mothers condition my nine year old daughter cries at the words said to her by my mom such as ""you are not pretty"" ""I'm beautiful you only look normal"" I have had to explain to my daughter that grandma is not here anymore. Her condition has put a stress and a pain on my marriage of twenty one years. I do not blame my wife. I understand how she feels and I have told her she is free to go and stay with her parents until I figure out the situation with my mom. Yesterday I had to force my mom to bathe she has not bathed in a few weeks the whole house smells of urine its a different kind of toxic urine smell that gives us all headaches. I literally had to pick her up put her in the shower and physically hold her down. All the while she is punching me in my face kicked my wife spit in my face bite my arm. I held her down and my wife washed her body. This was the last straw. My wife decided that she is taking the kids and leaving our home after this. I do not know what to do. I'm lost. I can not afford to put her into a care facility. The cost is around $3400 per month her SSI is only $1300 per month. I've had to quit work so I can be home with her 24/7 in order to make sure she does not hurt herself and that she eats. We have been living off our savings and credit cards. She does not qualify for any long term care I have applied and she is denied because her condition is existing and I have been told it is coverage she would have had to have already in place. She does have medicare but she was denied for medicaid when I tried to apply for that as well. I'm lost. I have no idea what to do where to go for help. She is my mom I love her dearly she did everything for me growing up but I do not want to loose my wife because of her please help me give me advice where can I look for help?

A year ago I had to move in with my Dad leaving behind the city I loved and all my friends so I could take care of my Dad living in a home I left for a reason and in a city I swore I wouldn't ever set foot in again but it was either that or live under a bridge.  Then after a year of caregiving which included the darkest depression I've ever had and a suicide attempt I got a job. It started yesterday.  Day 1: I get home and find that Dad has lost the continuous glucose monitor on his abdomen (it has fallen off somewhere) and has also misplaced the two TV remotes in the living room. He since brought a controller from his bedroom out and was attempting to use it and got frustrated that it wasn't working. I asked him what had happened to all these things and he couldn't remember and blamed the caregiver for losing the remotes.   Day 2: I get to make an emergency trip to the store because the cleaning lady needed laundry detergent. Then I have to leave work to go home and take care of paying the cleaning lady because Dad can't find his wallet. I go back to work for a few hours then get a migraine. I try to stick it out but can't so I get home early migraine screaming in my head my tummy threatening to upchuck again and since there are caregivers scheduled I go to bed darkening the room. For the next few hours I get woken up every 20-30 minutes because Dad has fallen because he tripped over something in the left of his visual field (which is missing due to a stroke but which is swears up and down is there) then his glucose monitor was not working then he lost his keys and was freaking out then he was demanding cookies and the caregiver couldn't distract him and he was starting to tear the house up looking for them then he tripped over something again. My head is now threatening to split down the middle with pain and I'm ready to go walk into traffic.  At this point I'm now scared that because Dad cannot transition to my not being there  I will have to give up this job that I desperately need. I tried to put him in day care but he refused to go unless I went with him. Just needed to vent a little.,False,mrgladd,2018-11-03,133.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545492,,,AlzConnected,,,
212,6210303ac9f833c0c9215298,2147541892,2018-06-11 18:38:00,what would you do? keep car? get rid of car?,As some of you know my MIL w MCI lost her drivers license recently. She lives in AL and has a SUV with a running board which she keeps there in the parking garage.  So far AL has been very chill about us leaving the car there - we have the keys - while we figure out what we are doing.  We need to get it out of there - she's fixated on it and it doesn't make sense to keep it in the AL parking lot (which isn't large) forever.    My in laws are from SoCal and are car people.  My husband and I live about 4 miles from her in a more urban area and are not car people.  We each have an older car - a sedan and a small SUV both of which are very difficult for my MIL to get in to due to mobility issues (she has edema is very large and uses a walker/is very weak so she can't hoist herself up or down into a car and can't bend her legs).  Basically the only car she can get into comfortably and without pain is her own.   We don't really want to maintain 3 cars (our two and hers) in our urban setting where we park outside on street or very small driveway.  Both our cars are 12 -17 years and probably won't last forever. If one dies we will probably not replace it for awhile. I do not commute in a car so mine is mostly for incidentals. We take her to all her doctors appointments hair appointments. etc.    I don't really like either of our three options so I wanted to see if anyone has any advice:   1*. Keep all three cars and use her car to drive her around in and our cars for our transportation.  Inconvenience of keeping three cars on the street (things like all cars must be moved every 72 hours etc). Also - she will wig out because it is inconceivable that a person would keep a car outside - her car is much newer and nicer than ours and I'm not thrilled about having to maintain it's pristine exterior.  This is the most inconvenient for us - maintain three cars store three cars do we have the right car to take her out in when we are coming from somewhere else.    *probably the best option right?   2. We get rid of my car and use her car in it's place.  I don't really like her car at all and hate driving it (it's really big) and I would probably be stressed if I got in an accident/dinged it up (we live in the city remember) but I could put up with it.  It would still be outside.  Fewer cars to maintain figure out on the street and cheaper for us.   3. Get rid of her car and she rides in my car.  I'm not sure I can take the yipping and cringing and having to hoist her legs up into the car.  It's not comfortable for her.  Most convenient for us but probably not the best choice.   If we keep her car - whether as a primary car or not - and she dies we would then either liquidate it or buy it from her estate if we wanted it.  We are her only caregivers POA and handle all finances  - and we have ongoing problems with her daughter taking her $$$ so it will be 100% clear that the car will not be ours (not in our name on our insurance etc).    I hate all these choices - thoughts?,False,citydock2000,2017-09-07,794.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541892,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is slipping away.,Friends: I have been a frequent contributor in my four years with this wonderful group and have shared my 89 year old MIL Tara's story since her diagnosis of late stage dementia in early 2016. She was immediately placed in a wonderful MC facility near our home where she received outstanding care through this heartbreaking journey. Tonight she is peaceful well cared for by our incredible hospice professionals that serve our MC along with her loving CNAs and RNs who have been by her side through the last four years of her life. She has slipped into deep sleep and will be entering her new journey imminently. We watched the beautiful soft orange Colorado sunset as she slept peacefully from her MC room that looks out onto our front range mountains and Pikes Peak beyond. Tara was an artist; an incredibly gifted one and she so loved the natural beauty of our Centennial state. Several of her paintings have accompanied her during this very difficult time the last four years. Tara fought this unrelenting disease with everything she had; a tiny woman with a ferocity that put dementia in its place until its cruel progress took so much away. She amazingly knew us until she closed her eyes this past Monday and was considered high functioning dementia which we are forever grateful even though the disease took so much of the person we knew and loved and stole her gift of drawing and painting. Please take a moment to send peaceful thoughts her way tonight and for the strength of her son (my husband) and our daughter (Tara's precious granddaughter). We're a tiny family so this loss will leave a huge hole in our hearts but she is leaving us so peacefully. She isn't in any pain and looks beautiful.

216,621030a0c9f833c0c92155ad,2147549231,2019-10-08 13:17:00,Last days for my other LO,We are in the last days of my elderly LO's life. I just rode with her in the ambulance relocating her back to a Butterfly Wing for increased pain meds and realistically she is not likely to leave here. Just 5 months shy of her 100th birthday so it has been a long blessed life. Still I had hoped to help her live out her last days in her home as she did for my uncle as he lived and died with Alzheimer's almost 2 decades ago. We almost made it through what seems like possibly her last week -- as she is clearly preparing to leave here. But her pain became too great to manage so without a compassionate assisted exit strategy allowed in the US this is our best option. As facilities go it is a very special place where she stayed for a few respite days recently and they cared for her lovingly. Not home but the next best thing.  I shared here recently that a DPOA situation was escalating so DH &amp; I would be speeding up plans to be with this LO 24/7 given advanced age and some recent questions about capacity and predators. My bi-weekly then weekly visits were no longer enough.The change was an adventure but it was the right move no pun intended. Both for DH &amp; for our other dear LO.  After an initial scare (Life Alert rescue and hospitalization) which she survived in good health and spirits 6 months ago she recently had a sudden stroke and went from hospital to in-home hospice paralyzed on one side in less than 4 days.   So I've been 24/7 caregiver for two on a whole new level recently serving as many of you do/have done. And learning more in the last 6+ weeks about administering comfort meds and providing all other hospice support for a bedridden adult -- turning diapering feeding bathing oral care etc. than I ever imagined. She was/is my 2nd PWD though undiagnosed.  It may have been hospital-induced delirium or just advanced age and/or vascular dementia all along. Either way she knows she is loved but that she is dying. And she never ever wanted to sit still or spend her life in bed unable to be independent at any level. So as of a few hours ago we are in a SNF because her pain was too great for Morphine and declining food/water for several days -- while still holding on to life -- has sent us to a higher level of hospice care where a Dr. can see her daily and they can try to at least control her pain.  I am thanking you all and my DH who led me to this forum. Who knew I would need what I've learned here so soon. Keeping you &amp; your loved ones in our thoughts &amp; prayers. Please send good thoughts energy &amp; prayers to this dear one who is living out her last days now.,False,ButterflyWings,2018-12-11,632.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549231,,,AlzConnected,,,

I had this done my self for a chipped front tooth in the 1980s and the bonding is still good. Then the Dentist a family Dentist for half a century says he simply cannot be her dentist anymore and recommends a Dental Surgeon. I took her there and this Dentist says she has to pull four teeth immediately. I  let her do it . A Surgeon. So as my Mom is coming out of the local; The surgeon comes over a says ""Can you keep her quiet I have other patients"". My mom is 83. Bleeding Four teeth pulled!         Next I take her to a Dentist who advertises his office as Elder friendly with experience in Alzheimers. My sister recommended him.  He looks and says he can't do the work but recommends a Periodondist. This  Gentleman can't do the work because the Anethesiologist needs 8 weeks notice and recommends the University Hospital School of Dentistry Which he tells me has a dozen dentist of different specialist at the hospital Dental Center.  We were put on a two month waiting list. There is in fact only one Dentist in the Special needs clinic and he is about to go on a month long religious Holiday. He wants to pull all her teeth in one day with three visits overall. Next month.        So I found another Dentist after another set of x-rays He recommends 20 root canals at he cost of 84000 dollars -64000 if we pay up front. I agreed to a scaling at 3000 dollars . By now her dental insurance is used up for the year. Periodontal with root canals on top? The strange thing is her teeth seem solid there is tarter at half the roots and now aware I can see her gums have receded a little by no visual indication of this serious a problem. We have been brushing! Together.. She does like late night ice cream which I did not Brush after But I did not see this coming . I love my mom and am an attentive caregiver. Now I'm a mess caught between two terrible things. I am thinking of simple Pain management type treatment as she is a stage 6 victim of this tragic illness. I am afraid of stage seven with abcessed teeth! I am really scared for her any advice on what I should do.",False,#3son,2019-10-17,8.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549375,,,AlzConnected,,,

My father 90 yrs old with moderate Alz &amp; vascular dementia has two Stage 2 pressure sores on his butt because he is in his recliner 24/7. This has been going on for over a year but they've recently become worse and cause him considerable pain.  I have a hospital bed and a new electric recliner that lays flat allowing him to turn on his side but he refuses to use the bed or try turning on his side. He also removes bandages and pads that he's supposed to sit on. He now cannot even lean back on the chair because of pain and he's sitting up on the edge of the chair and falling asleep like that. I'm afraid he'll fall forward on the floor. I think I've tried everything with the exception of an inflatable pad with a pump on the recliner. I don't know if it would fit on his recliner or that my Dad would not remove it like he removes everything else.  For the last year a variety of medical professionals have told him the risks and that he needs to get off his butt etc. He laughs and ignores them. He obviously is not in his right mind to be able to make his own health decisions so I don't feel like I can let him make this decision but it seems to be out of my hands. He's in control of his body.  Has anyone been in this situation? Do I just accept it?

219,621030d2c9f833c0c9215756,2147549224,2019-10-08 00:51:00,New to This. Fighting Two Battles. Confused Stressed and Utterly Lost.,"Hello to everyone and thank you for taking the time to open and read about my current life situation(s). I just want to start off by giving a quick background on myself so that you might better be able to understand some of the struggles I am having and why some things have become so ""overly-frustrating and difficult.""       My name is Allison. I'm a 36 year old woman and mother to a 15 year old girl. I am currently fighting A.S.P.S. (Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma) a very rare form of cancer - and when I say ""very rare"" this is what I mean : approximately 1% of all cancers are sarcomas and the type of sarcoma I have makes up less than 1% of all sarcomas. I have been fighting this battle since March of 2011 when I was diagnosed and had my first surgery 8 months later. Due to the location of the tumor (in and around my spinal cord) I lost a lot of the use of my left leg. After a lot of rehab I was able to walk with some semblance of normalcy and continued to be able to do so for several years.        Even though there were/are no ""approved"" drugs to treat what I have throughout the years I was put on three different chemotherapy treatments (one of which was through a clinical trial) which may have helped slow the progression of the tumor somewhat; each only seems to have worked for a short period of time. In 2014 I had surgery to remove a lobe of my left lung because one of the metastasis had grown too large and was dangerously/uncomfortably close to my heart. After that I was still doing my best to maintain something that resembled a normal life.       Just a couple of years ago in 2017 I started having problems with walking. My high leg (which was the one I depended on) started to lose feeling and I was losing feeling and function of pretty much everything from the waist down. I went to see my neurologist and 3 weeks later he had me in for a 14 hour surgery to place metal hardware in my spine and pelvis. I never really regained my ability to walk after that and have been stuck in a wheelchair since. After a lot of hard work since the surgery I have been able to regain my ability to stand for short periods of time and even take a couple of steps with my walker. I've started immunotherapy treatments that I go for every three weeks which have actually been able to make some progress with my cancer. It's something I never expected and even one of my doctors explained it to me as ""nothing short of a miracle."" So I thought to myself ""You mean I can actually start planning some things for a future? I might actually be able to live my life a little bit... even if it is just a 'short term solution'?"" Here I thought I was getting my life back but have since realized it had already been taken from me once again; this time with the diagnosis my mother received instead of my own.       Most days I'm just in a moderate amount of pain which I've learned to live with with the help of an implanted intrathecal pain pump. But there are some days when I'm in so much pain all I do is sit/lie on the couch. I do my best to take care of myself and my daughter in whatever ways I am able to. And now I'm also back living back at home having to do what I can to help take care of my mother as well.       Right around three years ago we noticed my mother starting to struggle with some things here and there but nothing that really ""jumped out."" I started getting really concerned when she would forget how to do very simple things that never were an issue for her in the past. She would bring her mail over to where I was staying and have me help her ""figure some things out"" with her bills and other things. My mother had always been such a meticulous keeper of her bills - I never remember her having paid one late in the whole 30+ years of my life. Now I'm going through the mail and making sure the bills are paid every week. And looking back there were little things here and there previous to that that should have ""triggered"" something in my own thoughts to tell me the something was wrong. I always feel guilty about that like if I had been able to recognize something sooner could it have made a difference in where we are today??        *Fast forward to ""today""* It seems like each day is filled with arguments and hurtful comments. There are times when I get so frustrated that I end up yelling and then feeling really bad about it after. Most times I just do my best to get out of the conversation so things don't escalate to that point. When she asks questions and I'm  trying to explain things I do it at the most basic level of understanding (a five or six year old would be able to grasp it); it truly breaks my heart when she still isn't understanding what I'm trying to explain to her.        My mother who is currently in her early 70's was always a very smart meticulous neat bright clean etc. individual. She was a teacher for 40+ years and there were a lot of times where she would have to explain things to me. I never had a fear of her putting herself in a dangerous situation not taking care of herself or being taken advantage of. Now I fear all of those things. When she goes out for a walk I always worry that she will look up and forget where she's at or what she's doing and/or end up panicking or getting lost; and this is the same neighborhood she's lived in for pretty much her entire adult life.        I have found that there's ABSOLUTELY no point in trying to reason with her in regards to ANYTHING at all; and this is an individual who used to be so reasonable about just about everything. If she told me grass was blue and I took her outside to show her it was green she'd try and convince me that I'm showing her the wrong grass (this hasn't happened but with the way things have been it's a fair example of what many of our conversations are like). It's even a fight trying to get her to take a shower; I keep getting responses like ""It just takes so much to get ready for it..."" or ""it's hard to get in and out..."" and when I push the issue I get ""Fine. I'll take care of it tomorrow..."" and yet tomorrow never comes.        Even though I know it's the disease and not at all her I still can't help but feel hurt when she says some really (what I feel to be) very nasty things. She'll say things to me like ""Why don't you just get up and go get it"" or ""there's something wrong with you... what's wrong with you? it's must be the medications you're on..."" etc. etc. etc. And then she'll go and make nasty comments about me to my 15 year old. I can't even imagine what it's like for my daughter living in and amongst this chaos; and then to have her grandmother talk down to her about her mother....       I'm needing to help her with so many basic things many of which are difficult for me to do for myself even due to the age of the house and pretty much nothing being truly ""accessible"" for me. Simple things like doing the laundry for example are difficult because my chair won't fit through any of the doors in the house and I can't easily access the room where the washer and dryer are at. When she needs help looking for - or doing - something that isn't in one of the main rooms of the house my daughter is stuck having to help with it. She's not even getting to truly be a teenager. It was bad enough that I need help with some things because of my physical disabilities and now she's also having to help her grandmother.       I am not an only child but my only other sibling is living many states away. Him moving back to the area just isn't something that's ever going to happen  so I feel as though I'm the one that ""got the job"" so to speak just because I never chose to leave the area. Please don't get me wrong; I love my mother very much and it truly breaks my heart to see her like this. I want to be able to help her but feel at this point I am barely able to help myself in so many things. With the way everything is happening I feel like I am completely losing any ""good parts"" of the relationship I had with my mother and my relationship with my daughter - while really good on some days - has for the most part been completely destroyed. I know the disease is hurting my mother and ruining so many things in her life and it has also taken it's toll on all of those around her.        I don't want it to seem like I'm the only one helping her. She does have a very supportive group of friends. There are a couple of ladies who help by bringing her to her doctors appointments (as I have only recently regained my ability to drive via the discovery of vehicle hand controls) and they make sure she gets out of the house by taking her out shopping or to eat and they still go see plays at a local theater which is something they've been doing for years. I'm so thankful that she has such wonderful people in her life. Truly I am.        But the day to day things are killing me and slowly driving me insane. I know that with everything that's been going on it has really taken a toll on my health. Even though I should be feeling wonderful because I was blessed enough to have a positive reaction to my treatments I am constantly feeling even more worn down than I was before any of this; I'm nervous with such bad anxiety that I've had to go on medication to help control it so tired that I'm taking naps during the day like a 3 year old and just overall ""out of sorts."" I try my best to keep it together for my daughter but I know she can see the stress and anxiety breaking through. And none of it is making it any easier to help me care for my mother either!   Help!! I can't take the constant daily battles and the building pressure.   Am I SELFISH for wanting to finally be able to live a life of my own? Or am I just the child that got a second chance at life and had to give it up again because I chose to live in the area where I grew up?   Putting her in an assisted living facility is out of the question and she keeps fighting me every time I talk about getting someone else to come in and help out.   HELP!!! What do I do?! Any thoughts suggestions... ANYTHING is so greatly appreciated. I am so happy to have come across this community; and though I'm upset at the ""need"" to be here I'm very happy that a place like this exists.

She is eligible due to so many recent hospitalizations for UTIs and significant recent decline. She's immunosuppressed. She also has some intermittent severe pain but the meds that can handle it make her more confused and so weak that getting her in a wheelchair now risks a fall. (I suppose Hoyer is next.) Despite this slide she has some good times. But if treatments can be withheld for an infection which would spell the end for her (and a number of medical people are suggesting they should be) how does one really know when enough is enough? To be completely frank I'm ruined by all this caregiving. Why isn't caregiver stress part of this equation????????? The focus is all on her quality of life. I feel guilty for asking but to be brutally practical it's ridiculous that my life is 100% down the tubes to keep this person alive at huge expense on every level for intermittent smiles and pleasure. Reality check please. I'm so strained and while there have been some good times and rewards along the way I can't romanticize this particular hell. There are other ways to have good times and rewards in life without such extreme downsides. What is the point? Wait until she's forgotten who everyone is (beginning to enter this stage slowly). Wait until every word out of her mouth is confused (getting there fast too because of the pain meds). Wait for what?! Nothing but bad things more and more of the time and then say oh okay it's finally time now that she's completely entirely miserable.  I do understand the desire to smiles and pleasure continue but I'm at the end of my rope so I'm thinking that maybe end of life QOL conversations need to factor in caregiver stress. Maybe *one or the other* should be at the end of their rope to say enough is enough. Why is the implication that the caregiver is failing to do enough for herself so that's on her (or him).  Maybe I'm just thinking this way because my whole life it was *all* about her. I hate this position so much.

A little more trouble with word-finding a littlemore trouble with short term memory but not bad. Mostly continent. Content andeasy going.    Tuesday I got a call that she had fallen in the bathroom(using a walker) onto her backside but there were no apparent injuries noteven a red mark. Next day she was walking as before working with PT no problem.Her right foot had been swollen for a week or so but they were just keeping aneye on it.    Today I went to see her about 10:30am and she was stillin bed dozing with oxygen on. I went to her nurse to see what was up and shesaid Mom had been complaining of a lot of pain from the fall so they didxrays but showed no fractures. They also did a Doppler sonogram on her leg andfound a blood clot in spite of her being on a blood thinner. They are prettymuch giving her pain meds whenever they can to keep her comfortable and theyseem to be working except when they have to turn her to clean her etc. Thenshe cries out pitifully even though they are gentle with her. I told her nurseI was thinking it was time to give hospice a call and she just kindly said “yeah.”So I will be meeting with them in the morning.    This afternoon her nurse practitioner called after seeingher to discuss things. She left a lot of the decisions up to me – but It’s atough spot to be in. My siblings are both out of town but visit when they can.However since I am the nurse in the family they leave decisions up to me andare fully supportive of me. So many dilemmas. I wonder if a UTI is behind someof this…but obtaining a specimen would cause her a lot of pain whether from beingcathed or put on a bedpan. They could start her on another blood thinner butthere is a risk of bleeding if she should bump her head. But if we don’t partof the clot might break off and go to her heart or brain.        Mom is a DNR and I know what I DON’T want done – no CPR nohospitalization (except for a fracture or something like that) it’s just thein-between decisions that are so hard. My Dad died after 10 years of wrestlingwith Alzheimers…all the way to the bitter end of stage 7. I was hoping Mom wasnot going to have to go that far but now that we’re here it’s all happeningtoo fast. I’m not ready for this.    Sorry for such a long post – it’s just been a difficultday.

My sister has severe dementia and had fallen at the nursing home where she lives. They x-rayed her and confirmed she fractured her humerus. The next day we took her to the doctor at an Emergency department of a hospital to confirm treatment (e.g. surgery therapy).     While we were waiting to see the Care Manager at the hospital my sister experienced bowel incontinence and needed to be changed.The nurses (CNAs?) came in and were very rough and hurried while changing her and rolled her onto her broken arm despite our telling them that was her bad arm twice. My sister screamed in pain to which the nurses ignored my sister's cries and continued to deal with the incontinence instead of stopping. The nurses never reassured my sister or comforted her in any way but only said that this is how ""they"" are referring to dementia patients. From that point my sister was extremely terrified of the nurses touching her and causing further pain. Later when my sister was being transferred to a chair she was screaming again so scared of being harmed by the nurses that she collapsed from fear. Afterwards my sister continued to be in pain as we waited to be discharged.   The doctor never looked at or took additional xrays. The nurses harmed and traumatized my sister. They did not provide any pain medication.    The abundance of negligence and lack of care has me wondering how do I proceed with this horrific event.

I have a call into Hospice now because I am not liking how this is going so far.    I am never rude to my Mom's caregivers and I will not be this time either I want them to feel appreciated and respected but I expect them to listen to my Mom's wishes (not to have food forced on her) and help her with pain she is obviously still experiencing.

Here are some details about what we’ve been experiencing:    Earlier this year my dad (77 with dementia advanced enough that he doesn’t know my name) has started having periodic crying episodes. They come on suddenly in the middle of a conversation or activity and within a few seconds he is sobbing uncontrollably. This will go on for at least 15 minutes and I believe it has lasted up to an hour or perhaps even more even with attempts at redirection. I have been present for a couple of these; the assisted living he is at has told me about others. It seems that they may sometimes be triggered by music but not always. They also I believe have only happened in the afternoon (between around 1 and 4pm) so they may be a form of sun downing. They seem to happen every couple of weeks or once a month—at this point it’s hard to tell if they are getting more frequent or are staying about the same.         While he is crying he’ll respond to questions or attempts to redirect him and then another round of sobs will start. When asked why he’s crying he usually doesn’t answer or says something to the effect of “it’s all wrong and will never get any better”. Once it seemed like he was crying about feeling like he had failed as a dad; another time after some probing he said that he was crying because he missed my mom who died around 25 years ago (this seemed significant because he has not brought up my mom once since getting dementia). Trying to reassure him telling him that he’s loved was a great father etc don’t seem to help— he says thank you and keeps crying. Bringing up happy experiences with the family also doesn’t seem to help. The only redirection that seems to have helped is talking about something completely neutral (like his coin collection).         He has a history of undiagnosed/untreated depression which he has probably suffered with since my mom died (long before he had signs of dementia).     He is currently on venlafaxine though at a fairly low dose and has been on it for several years.          Our main concern is how we can best support him through these episodes. While it kind of seems like these could be moments of lucidity and processing real pain that he’s never dealt with which coould be really good and healthy....but with how advanced his dementia is it doesn’t seem like he can meaningfully resolve any of the painful experiences so he is effectively just feeling the pain without getting any benefit from it. So it seems that redirecting him is best and while I think we have some idea about how to do that I’d love other ideas. And I’m also confused about how big of a response is needed—-should we be treating this as something that is significantly decreasing his quality of life and needs a real intervention or as one of the inevitable parts of living with dementia that we should just seek to manage as best we can?        I’ve done some reading on this issue but most of what I’m seeing (articles about manic laughing/crying episodes) doesn’t really reflect what I’m seeing in my dad. We’ve talked about this with his doctor and are basically taking a wait and see approach. So I’m curious how others have handled dementia patients who get stuck in negative or painful emotions—-how we can think about the pros and cons of him experiencing the pain and crying it out; tactics for redirecting or otherwise helping him through it; when it seems severe enough that medication or a more significant response might be warranted etc.         Appreciate any ideas or suggestions!,False,sbh1221,2012-01-30,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549021,,,AlzConnected,,,

I've really been dreading this part of the disease hoped it would never get to this but here it comes.  Over the last several months she has been having more and more bowel accidents. She will insist she is done and doesn't realize she is still pooping and says she's done when clearly when you go to wipe her she is not. We finally had to take the tp away from her because she was making more of a mess trying to clean her own self up. Now we give her some when she says she's done and monitor her as she wipes instead leaving her with a roll. I always go behind her after she wipes when she pooped in the past to make sure she was good and clean most of the time she missed some and put A&amp;D ointment on her before this started. Thank God no major accidents yet since we have her on a toileting schedule already.                                                                        I've also noticed over the last few months she has been leaving more food on her plate so she's not eating as much as she used to. No significant weight loss from this that I've noticed. She does seem a bit weaker though. It's been taking more and more effort on my part to get her to a standing position. Her knee with the arthritis in it seems to be bothering her more which is making it more difficult for her to turn and transfer from one seat to the other. She also has pretty much quit walking altogether which doesn't help in keeping her strength up. Try to give her something for the pain and she will pretend to take it wait till we leave the room then spit it back out and hide it. I caught her in the act the other day doing it. We had been finding pills from time to time in the floor by her potty chair or in the bed. The last time the hubby gave her something for pain he found it a few hours later so this time I sat in the living room just out of her sight and watched. The hubby went in and out of the room a couple times and she seen me once. Took three or four different drinks of water watched the hubby go out the door and took it out of her mouth ( not realizing I was still back there) and went to hide it in her little pocket on her jammies. She had been holding that pill in her mouth a good 4 or 5 minutes and it was mushy from dissolving. She's a mess lol. I'm afraid if we can't get her to start walking again before long she's gonna end up bed ridden and we really don't want that even though we are pretty sure it's going to end up like that before the end.  We are trying our best to keep her in her home till the day comes that she goes home with Jesus. I'm just not sure how much of the stage 7 declines I'm gonna be able to manage. We've had it easy so far with the urinary incontinence and the occasional sundowning attitude and confusion ( the quadapine has helped lessen this ) and no short term memory. You can just about quote her responses to things and what she is gonna say to you as she starts to say it. I guess she just really don't know what else to say.  Oh well now that fun with poop is becoming the norm I hope that  bed ridden and food pureeing is not in our future.

I have been reading alot of your stories tho for the past few months.   I am the only child of a single mother. She has been living with my Husband and myself since her heart attack and surgery in 2003.   Her memory issues really began in 2009 and now it is full scale dementia/alzheimers. I never had her ""tested"" this is all based on what her Primary Care has seen. IMO she is late mid-stage Alzheimers.   I am looking for advice and just well support.   To make a very long story short she recently fell and broke her hip (2 weeks ago).. As I am sure you all know this kind of thing and the surgery and hospital stay etc is NOT good with a memory impaired patient.   This whole ordeal has been nothing short of a nightmare. She did not remember the fall shortly after it happened. Had no idea why she was in the hospital or why her leg hurt. Fought everything every step of the way.   Rehab was worse. She decompensated memory and behavior wise. She would argue fight hit slap throw things and just be uncooperative and combative the entire time. I know it was due to confusion pain fear and over-stimulation not too mention the meds she was on. But I was disappointed that they just could not handle her at all.  She lasted all of a week in Rehab before they sent her back to the ER and would not take her back. I ended up taking her home.   She is alittle better behavior wise. She is only on the pain meds for now. But she has been waking up in the middle of the night and wanting to wait for the ""cab"" to ""take her home"" and I can not seem to convince her she is home and to go back to bed. She gets more agitated the more I try to talk to her.   I can handle her during the day (I do have a great Caregiver too)... but what do I do about the nights and this behavior?  I need to sleep and I am all worked up about what the next night will bring. Any thoughts on meds? Any advice? I will take whatever I can get and will answer any questions you may have...

She drank a glass of juice this morning... but she used to drink alot more.   She is complaining of stomach pains pretty bad stomach pains. Her belly looks bloated to me as well.   A bit of background on her stomach back in 2012 she had surgery for scar tissue/Chron's disease and a peice of her intestine was removed. As it was explained to me the peice removed contained the ""valve"" that controls water content in the intestine.. so she would always have loose stool from now on and that has proven to be true.    So constipation is something that is hard to detect in her due to the fact that I have heard her going to the bathroom and heard the familiar .. err... noises. But apparently she can still be constipated? Not sure..  My question is could this be the beginning of the end? Is dehydration setting in? I refuse to treat her for anything at this point as she does NOT do well in the Hospital and it only causes more pain for her (blood work blood pressure etc)...

It took 20 minutes to calm her down after they moved her from her wheelchair to her bed in the care home. I felt so helpless. I had brought over Alexa and set it up in her room to play her favorite music. Omg I did not expect that. It was the worst I had ever seen my Mom. She is not a complainer ever! I held her hand and let her know it was going to be okay. I even gave her a foot rub anything to try to make her more comfortable to stop crying. Now I'm rethinking the Tremadol and thinking she needs something stronger. Hospice will be paying their visit tomorrow and they will be calling me. The caregivers said 2 of the residents have the Fentanyl Patch that last for 3 days and manages pain. At this point it is all about pain management.

She planned on living to 100.    The first fall was due to icy ground and a hyperactive dog that she had taken out side. Other falls were due to a condition she had which made her fall.  They would have done a surgery for the condition that caused her to fall had it not been for her age.    I wish the nursing  home had checked on her at night to see if she needed to go the bathroom or just gotten her up at night to go to the bathroom because she fell rushing to the bathroom more than once.  This frustrates me.   I'm glad that she knew family and friends to the end even though she was getting more confused.  She woke up briefly when she was dying and smiled when she saw one of my cousins that meant a lot to her.   She did die peacefully thankfully.  But my heart is still grieving of course.  My faith is helping.,False,Family_Member2019,2019-07-30,7.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147548858,,,AlzConnected,,,

I took her there Thursday and moved her things Friday because I didn’t have any way to get her out of the house to move her furniture first. Moving the furniture was more stress &amp; work but maintenance was very helpful. My mom was sitting outside watching the ducks with an aide and some other residents when we moved her things. I walked by her several times but she didn’t notice me. She looked very tiny (she is very tiny) and dazed.  Later that night I fell in my bathroom. It was a bad fall and I live alone. It was darn* scary lying on the floor wondering if I could get up and how long it would take someone to find me if I couldn’t. Well I managed to get up just like the heroine does in the movies but decided I had to get checked since I was in so much pain &amp; couldn’t walk. My son carried me to the car and drove me to the ER. The X-ray didn’t show anything was broken so I was relieved. The diagnosis was a groin injury. (Groin is an ugly word and sounds nasty.) They gave me a Walker and Instructions to take Ibuprofen and see a Specialist if I didn’t see improvement in 3 days. I’ve been out of work all week. In 20 years at my job I’ve never been out more than 2 days at a time. I’ve also never hit my insurance deductible but there’s a first time for everything.  I haven’t been able to go see my mom but they say she’s doing OK aside from some of her old phantom aches and pains making a comeback. She’s been asking where the door is so she can leave - that sort of thing.   So to sum up - my 87 year old mother went to memory care and all I got was a smashed groin an enormous bruise on my thigh and a walker.

I am the one with boots on the ground daily monitoring my mother's mental and physical condition taking her to Dr. appointments test procedures etc. My siblings older brother and sister want to make sure they're a part of the process and the brother is insistent on meddling into suggested procedures.    For example Mom has a cancer lesion on her thoracic spine butting up to the canal. According to Dr.'s it can cause back pain in the near future. At the appointment we thought it would be a good idea to have the area radiated and alleviate the potential for back issues. Makes sense. Dr. suggested a once and done radiation treatment with minimal side effects potential back pain for a day or two and a steroid pill before and after. Sounds pretty easy right?  My mom's cognitive abilities are pretty good when it comes to procedural things. However understanding the medical world or procedures side effects etc. is non-existent. She always listens to my brother because he's the man even though she thinks men don't give women the time of day. I find that conundrum rather interesting but it must have something to do with the dementia and things they revert back to in their childhood.  Long story short my brother in his infinite wisdom contacted her Dr. got him to suggest having 3-5 treatments instead of the one. I just found out that now she's going to be on steroids' for the duration of the treatments AND she will have to go through the rigors of regular treatment center visits clothes cold room table etc. To make matters worse she will also have the potential for back pain after EVERY treatment!!! This is how my brother helps our mother with palliative care!!! Ouch!!!  Is there anything I can do to protect my mother from my brother's ""good will"" efforts? All she knows is that he's her son and he knows best. She no longer has the reasoning skills to recognize what makes the most sense to keep her the most comfortable as her cancer ultimately swallows up the rest of her life.

I packed up her apartment cried a lot and moved her in.  All documents are in order I manage all of her meds and finances she's happy with her dog in her bedroom and sitting room.  Most of the time she's pretty content.     The good:   she's continent still! Mostly anyway.  They do ""potty reminders"" at the day program (more on that to follow). We've got a bedside commode in her room and that helps.  She goes to a daycare (""the senior center"") while I'm at work.  The office of aging program covers that and also sends people from an agency 6 hours a week.  I have hired a small team of people to fill in some of the gaps and they are great. Mom is relatively oriented she knows who I am where she is and generally who she's with if they are familiar to her (knows the family for instance).  Independent in ADLs with some prompting.  Doesn't resist bathing (although she only takes a bath once or twice a week but I know what a blessing it is!).   Her overall health is so much better now that she has been getting her meals and meds on schedule and as prescribed. She loves to play gin rummy and will beat an opponent as often as she loses. I might need to remind her how to play when we first sit down although she plays every day.  Also - she doesn't play with poop.  Hey that's a good thing!  She puts her hair up in pin curls every night and puts makeup on every morning.  Sometimes I have to touch things up with a Q-tip so she doesn't look like Liza Minelli but it's all part of being a diva. She doesn't wander.  She doesn't sundown too much (cranky but not full on sundowning and rarely now that she gets CBD oil 2x daily).  She sleeps all night (thank you Melatonin extended release).    The sad  : So hard to see her memory slipping more and more.  I learned what was coming here so I feel like I am as prepared as a person can possibly be but it's sad to see the gradual changes.  It's sad to not have ""my real mom"" to the same extent as I used to.  I grieve sometimes.  The repetition is sad/funny - yes we have the same conversations over and over again and sometimes it makes me want to cry - but other times it is just hilarious so what the heck laugh when you can. It's sad to see her slipping in some of the ways she used to take care of herself things that were just ""her way"".   Sad that her only sister doesn't have any contact with her hasn't for many years beyond an occasional card.  Sad that my mom can't figure out how to use her phone a lot.  It's sad that she deals with pretty bad pain but her kidney disease advanced so options for pain relief are limited.  Sometimes she makes it up the stairs and crawls into her room - but no way does she want a first floor bedroom - although ultimately that's my decision not hers - and she's actually safer upstairs (from a diabetic perspective no refrigerator raids in the middle of the night) -  so I waver back and forth between changing her bedroom and to heck with it or keeping things as they are because she's stable and we can sleep at night.    The bad:   We are having almost daily battles to get her to go to the day program.  I have pulled every therapeutic tall tale whopper (we are waaaaay beyond fiblets but you do what you gotta do) out of my hat and some days nothing works.  Not bribery not telling her we have roofers coming and they will bang on the house all day not cajoling not telling her she has a doctor's appointment and I will pick her up not telling her we don't have a nurse to come to the house and she needs to go to get her meds there's a field trip they have a special activity - when she shuts it down there is nooooo way. At those moments she doesn't care if I could lose my job or someone else could get in trouble.  I told her I could end up in jail and she said ""good"".   I have a camera in the house just in case but really she can't stay alone - but I can't always get someone to stay at home with her last minute and leaving work at the drop of a hat a few times a week would cost me my job.  Intermittent FMLA wouldn't work for as many times as she wants to stay home and there would be  no pay for hours not worked which would be disastrous. So that's a daily source of major major stress.  I will turn off the cable box in her room so she is more open to going because she'd ""be bored"" at home. It's enough to make me consider placement but not sure we could make that happen financially.  Oh- and the agency! Oh my gosh.  Horrible experiences with some people - unreliable not honest totally clueless on my mother's condition etc - but then a few gems.  The agency sends non-medical help.  All I really want is a reliable person to make sure she's not alone.  Right now things are pretty ok but we've had some awful experiences.  Well that's all on my end for now.  To the familiar and encouraging voices out there your words have continued to be a source of strength.  To the newer folk drink deeply from this well of compassionate support.  What a privilege to have this place to learn to vent to share to encourage and be encouraged on this most difficult and challenging path.",False,kelantol,2013-05-03,422.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147548206,,,AlzConnected,,,

We brought her home on Hospice.  about 60 days later she had new blood work and her kidneys rallied back up to 23 so she was bounced off Hospice. About two weeks later she was back in the hospital with high potassium again.  This time she was referred for in home Palliative care. Within a week the same doctor who bounced her off Hospice also said she wasn’t eligible for the palliative care. Prior to that  one of the other palliative doctors has assessed her and said her Kidney disease was Stage 4 out of 5 and her Dementia was stage 6.5 our of 7.  Through all of this her dementia has gotten so much worse she is fully incontinent.  She is often prone to diarrhea. My dad will help clean her up etc but she is really resistive and combative to his aid.  I work full time but have had to leave work to help clean her up etc.  I would check up on her after work and often times find her sitting in her own mess. My dad tried to feed her and she refuses to eat. We ended up paying for an AM caregiver 2 hours in the AM 7 days a week to get her bathed and cleaned up for the day.  We hired a second caregiver for 2 hours in the evening to again make sure she is cleaned up for the night.  We met with her regular physician and her nephrologist after she was kicked off palliative care and all agreed that with her dementia she was just not a good candidate for dialysis and if we weren’t going to do dialysis constantly poking her to do labs to monitor her kidney and potassium levels was just too much for her.  Her nephrologist said let her be  Let her eat what she wants drink what she wants make sure she doesn’t get dehydrated.  We have been giving her half an ativan in the morning to help with the agitations liquid tylenol to handle pain and imodium to handle the diarrhea.  But she has still been hard to keep clean even in between the two care givers.  Well anyway the past week she has  been sleeping a lot dealing with a lot of diarrhea  hardly eating sleeping all day  I would get her to at least eat pudding and drink water but my dad was still having issues getting her to eat and getting her cleaned up. He has just been so overwhelmed.  yesterday her AM caregiver called and said she was in a lot of pain not wanting to het her give her a bath she has not eaten much in almost two days.  She recommended we call 911 and take her to the emergency room.  We did.  While we were there she did lab works and found out her kidney function was down to 11 and her potattisum was again high about 6. We again told the hospital we would not be doing dialysis.  This time around I had to make some hard decisions. She was again eligible for Hospice but I asked for assistance in getting her into a board and care facility.  My dad wants her home and he insists he can take care of her but she needs to much care right now. She is almost pretty much bed bound.  When we do manage to get her up and to the bath room everyone is exhausted and she sleeps for at least an hour after the ordeal. I spoke to her caregiver and  even she recommended an in patient hospice program.  As my dad is so overwhelmed.   My husband had to borrow off his retirement to pay for the board and care.  Medicare will pay for all the hospice/medical expenses but we have to pay for the board and care.  We found a really nice place that is a private home. It has only been a day but I am very happy with the staff.  Hospice will send a care nurse to do baths the LVN will visit two times a week the facility can call anytime she complains of pain and they can administer morphine if needed.   My problem is I keep second guessing my decision.  Now that she is back on Hospice could my dad have taken care of her at home with the caregivers we had hired? Then she could be at home  I just keep feeling like I acted too soon.  I told my dad I retire in October and then we can look at options of bringing her home because then I can be there during the day.  Actually we could even consider bringing her to my home. I know she is being   carded for but I just feel sad   leaving her after I visit.,False,Nins Sherry,2019-06-22,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547884,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'm sorry this will be long.  I tend to be wordy.  Here goes.  So as most of you know my mom passed away July 17.  She had AD since 2014.    Now I'm caring for my dad.  Instead of 18 hours a day I am there about 3 hours a day.  Dad does NOT have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's but his geriatrician has ""Mild cogntive impairment"" on his online chart from May 23 and ""Acute cognitive decline"" on his online chart from July 12.  Friday August 2 Dad fell twice.  First in the morning after being on his computer.  He stood up from his chair reached for his walker and his knees gave out causing him to fall.  He managed to crawl back to his bedroom and get into bed then he called me to let me know.    Dad has not had any knee issues prior to this.  I went over at 11 for the lunch hour and he was in the kitchen.  He seemed fine.  I left at 2.  At 6 he called saying when he finished supper he got up out of his chair in the kitchen reached for his walker and once again his knees buckled under him causing him to fall.  He scooted back to his bedroom on his behind but said his knees hurt so he couldn't get in bed.  I suggeseted he use a pillow under his knees as a cusion which he did and was able to get back in bed.  He called me Saturday morning at 6:30 saying he could not get out of bed.  I went over at 7:30 but he's too heavy for me to try and assist him (6' at 250 pounds).  So I called the on-call doctor.  When she called back (dad's doctor herself was on-call) she suggested I give him Tylenol and rub Voltaren gel on his knees wait an hour and see if he could stand.  Did that waited 90 minutes but dad still could not stand.  Called doctor back she suggested he go to the ER.  At the ER there were no available rooms so from 10:30 until 5 dad was in the ER hallway.  Not ideal but I get it that rooms are for true trauma cases.  The ER did knee xrays and head CT plus UA.  Everything turned out no problems.  But since he still could not stand they admitted him.  The doctors pretty much ""dismissed"" the fact that two days prior dad developed upper back pain when he bent over to put on his socks and shoes.  Each healthcare provider kept asking if he got dizzy lightheaded short of breath or had chest pain prior to his falls.  I get they have protocols and need to rule out other causes but they basically dismissed my mention of new upper back pain and the fact his knees gave out on him which caused the falls.    The ER doctor said dad would be evaluated by PT/OT and probably referred to rehab.  On Sunday I missed the PT visit by about an hour - I had requested I be called but that didn't happen.  I get it that in the hospital there aren't specific times but still.  Anyway I asked dad what PT said and he said ""they want me to exercise.""  I did manage to speak to the nurse who paged the PT and they said they'd be there around 10 Monday.   Yesterday Monday I was there at 9:30.  PT/OT did manage to get dad into a standing position but it caused him much knee and back pain.  They didn't try anything further.  Social Worker came by and had me choose a few rehab centers and will be getting Medicare authorization.  Dad broke his ankle in 2013 and ever since has not been nearly as active as he had been.  Pluse he has developed low back pain and his activity level has decreased even more.  He's had a few lumbar injections for his back pain which helps but he tires so quickly.  He has had several rounds of home health PT but doesn't want to exercise.  He does faithfully do the exercises every day but really just goes through the motions. I know he is deconditioned but he lacks motivation to even try and help himself.   Dad told me yesterday he doesn't want to go to rehab. I explained to him that's fine.  That's his decision and he can refuse.  HOWEVER if he doesn't at least try it there is NO WAY I can care for him and he will end up in a nursing home!  I explained the rehab will be paid by Medicare but a nursing home will be $6000 a month until he hits poverty level and then Medicaid will pay.  So he has reluctantly agreed to try rehab. But there's the catch.  He is only agreeing to this because it's covered.  I doubt seriously he will actually try but still just go through the motions.   I have an appointment with an elder care lawyer Thursday and have basically told my brother he must come with me.  There are 9 pages of financials to fill out ahead of the appointment.  The lawyer's website said free initial consultation but apparently that lawyer is out of town and the one I ended up with doesn't offer the free consult.  smh.  Sure seems like a ""bait and switch"" situation.    Anyhoo Medicaid is probably in dad's future especially if he can't stand/ambulate but since mom died I'm sure that everything I knew about it before has been tossed out the window i.e. the spouse could keep $23000 or so and Medicaid would still have covered - but dad is no longer a spouse.  Anyhoo I know dad doesn't have AD and this community may not be appropriate for me to post about my dad but I'm sure I will be told so and/or forgiven.    The journey with my mom was hard - this is worse.    My brain hurts.  Or rather the space where my brain USED to be hurts.  I am not sure I even have a brain anymore.    Sorry this was so long.

My other concern is how he will react once he is there and whether it is better to put him in a memory care unit or in assisted living.   His symptoms are more like Lewy Body than AD.  No hallucinations but his cognition is declining very fast  and he has a lot of balance problems.  He has had some falls recently and will probably have more--he is in complete denial about his mobility limitations and won't use a walker.  He doesn't roam or exit-seek (at least not at home).  He can still carry on a lucid and somewhat sophisticated  conversation if he isn't too tired.   He sleeps a lot during the day and does not want a lot of activities or interaction.  I think he needs more care than he would get in assisted living because of the fall risk.  But I'm concerned he will completely freak out if he finds himself in a locked unit.  He is a free spirited artist and I don't think he would respond well to captivity.  I'm also afraid he might never forgive me or trust me again if I put him someplace he doesn't want to be even if it's only for a few days.  The facility is sending someone out to do an assessment tomorrow but I thought I would ask for advice here too.   thanks.,False,CatBallou729,2019-03-10,141.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147548338,,,AlzConnected,,,

When my dad was staying with me she came up a lot in conversation and I always told him that she passed.  On a few occasions before he left my house he insisted on going to the bank to handle some banking for her even though A) she has passed away and B) he was removed from her account when he started to mismanage her money due to his AD and became extremely upset at me when I reminded him of same.  He ended up writing himself a note in his planner on a sticky note that she is gone and also put a reminder in his iPhone (but of course he doesn't remember to even look at his planner most days so that note is effectively useless; he also looks at the reminder in his phone but it's as if he doesn't see it).  Since he left my house to go to his girlfriend's house she and I have reminded my dad several times about our aunt when it comes up and generally gets agitated and frustrated and sometimes downright depressed and those emotions usually last for the rest of the day.    This is a frequent source of pain for my dad - I imagine every time we tell him she died it's like he is hearing it for the first time and starts the grieving process all over again.  Should we keep reminding him or no?  Should we write a more prominent note for him?,False,momovig,2019-06-06,11.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147548211,,,AlzConnected,,,

256,621032a6c9f833c0c9216615,2147548233,2019-07-31 17:32:00,A suggestion for those with LO's in a facility,This is a story about the balance between being an advocate and not being controlling.    My mother has been in Memory Care for 3 months now.  For a year and a half prior to this she was in an unlocked facility with nursing care.  It was there that I had to learn to let go of  Mom's care and not meddle too much with the way staff cared for her.  It's difficult when you're quite involved and you're used to being so diligent.  I know I had them shaking their heads at me even though I had a good relationship with most of the staff.  The head nurse and I clashed pretty good as she wanted Mom medicated and I didn't.  Neither of us backed down so it was good that Mom moved.  When she moved to this present facility I tried really hard to not to step on toes and trust that they were doing their jobs well.  For the most part it has been very positive.    A few days ago I received a phone call from the day nurse saying that Mom was shaking and was very confused.  She didn't know who I was and had pain on the right side of her chest and her head.  They put her back to bed without breakfast.  The nurse then called the doc. who said to monitor her.  I really like the day nurse - she did everything right took all her vitals etc.  She wanted to know if anything like this had happened before.  She also told me that Mom had vomited a few nights prior.  As they had put Mom on a new medication a few weeks prior I immediately thought of side effects.  This medication is for loose stool.  When they prescribed it I took down the name of it and looked at possible side effects and monitored Mom for these.  She was fine.  What I did notice is that at suppertime they mixed the medicine in juice for her but she wasn't drinking the juice.  She didn't like it.  It would sink to the bottom and form a slime.  I don't know that anyone checked to see if she was drinking it.    So as not to step on toes  I decided to do some research first and learned that it could be mixed with yogurt.  I phoned the next day and spoke with the 'days off' day nurse (a nurse I didn't know).  I wanted to know how many times a day Mom took this medication.  She told me she would have to look it up but sounded busy and not wanting to go and look it up!   This was my next mistake I didn't say 'OK look it up and call me back'.   Instead I asked if she gave it that morning.  She said 'no she didn't'.  I asked if she would be giving it at lunch.  She said she didn't know she would have to look it up (again with that tone).  So I let her off the hook and just asked what she thought of mixing it with yogurt.  She said sure why not try it.  I assumed it was just given once a day as I knew they gave it to her at suppertime.  I brought the yogurt when I visited that afternoon and talked to the care aide about it.  Apparently it is them who mix the powder with the juice.  They realized that it sunk with Mom's juice so they inquired about mixing it with orange juice which is better.  Apparently it doesn't sink.  I said 'sure'.  Well Mom quite liked the orange juice so she drank it all up.  Fast forward several days and I receive this phone call.  I suggested that perhaps now that she's liking the juice she's actually drinking it all and so is now getting side effects.  The nurse was confused.  She said she gets it just once a day and  she  gives it to her in the morning.  Now we're both confused as I know for a fact they're giving it to her at suppertime.    As it turns out another resident gets the same medication twice a day.  So someone assumed that Mom got it twice a day as well.  She was being double dosed.    I have learned my lesson.  I will make sure that I am aware of all of the details of Mom's prescriptions and monitor that they are giving them to her at the correct dosage and times.    It really is a balancing act of being gracious but not letting anything get overlooked.    Of course the evening nurse phoned with an apology and I spoke at length with the Director of Care about all of the confusion (re: the first nurse I spoke to said she didn't get it in the AM yet she had signed off that she had given it?? / the care aides giving a medication without the nurse's instruction / not monitoring that the medicated juice is being consumed)  She was receptive and is putting changes in place.  And Mom is fine.  She felt better after she ate although she was constipated for several days...  I wanted to write this for others to be aware of.  I tend to be too controlling but in trying to be more relaxed I missed this mistake.  My suggestion is to monitor medications carefully.  Some things are too important to take a relaxed stance with.  If anyone has suggestions on how to approach being an effective advocate without stepping on toes I'd love to hear it!,False,mostlyme,2018-12-17,286.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147548233,,,AlzConnected,,,

I got up and rushed to the ER. Once I convinced them he had dementia and I was his POA they took me back to the exam room to be with him.   We were in the ER for 9 hours!  He was so confused and agitated.  He kept trying to pull his IV out and pull off the heart monitor.  He kept trying to get up.  It was all I could do to keep him in that bed!   He was in so much pain.  They finally gave him a percoset and it didn't even touch the pain.  They x-rayed him and ran a zillion tests.  They took him to CT and I went with him.  The doctor said he did a good job and held still.  He was wheeled back to his exam room.  About two hours later the CT dept came back to get him.  I stopped them and said ""He's already had a CT.""  The man said the doctor wants another one.   I asked why and he said that the doctor saw something unusual and wanted to use contrast and do it again.  So off we went to CT again.  I knew something was wrong.  Then we went back to the exam room.  Hours later the ER doctor came to the door and motioned for me to come out in the hall.  He asked me what my relationship was and I said I was his daughter and his POA.  He said there is no easy way to tell you this but your father has multiple metastatic brain tumors.  He needs to be admitted so oncology can source and stage the cancer and start radiation immediately.   Then he'll need aggressive chemotherapy to the cancer source.    I was shocked.  But it did explain some of the symptoms he's been having lately -- trouble walking abnormal gait that didn't respond to PT more confused than usual some minor apraxia not much appetite withdrawing from activities he used to love and a severe decline in memory.    I just looked at the doctor  for a minute and then said ""Thank you for telling me but there is no way I'm going to put my 85 year-old father with dementia  through radiation and chemo.""  He said ""If it was my father I wouldn't either."" and he put his hand on my shoulder.  I asked him to please discharge my dad so I could take him home.  I took him home.  I arranged for 24-hour health care aides.  I stayed 'til they got there.  I went out and bought him a walker and a wheelchair.   I emailed his orthopedic surgeon and asked him to look at Dad's ER report and records.  He responded that after looking at it he felt there was nothing more he could do for my father.  He told me to have Dad use a walker or wheelchair give him tylenol for the pain and that there was no need to schedule any follow-up appointments.

Anyway I will update as the situation warrants and no timeline has been given but realistically I think we are looking at hours to days at the outside at this point.  She is on a pretty heavy cocktail of drugs to reduce the jerking motions and I will be very happy when she can just sleep peacefully since right now she is sleeping but moaning and thrashing.  The nurse said all the drugs and her own body will finally get so tired she will finally sleep (not pass just sleep) peacefully.",False,Nanacare,2019-04-29,22.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547273,,,AlzConnected,,,

I set the appointment today - dentist appointment is next Tuesday afternoon.  I'm going to have his facilities' bus take him and the caregiver to the dentist office and I'm driving my car and bringing along diapers wipes a change of clothing for him a bath towel washcloth and a trash bag jic.  I warned the dentist's office about what is coming - they have cleaned his teeth before. Last time he couldn't get himself out of the dentist's chair and he won't allow anyone to help him so this ordeal went on for over an hour while we waited for the bus to come (they were picking up multiple people that day) and the dentist had another patient coming but we couldn't get dad out of the dentist chair.  The dentist wanted to help but with dad no way.  Finally the bus driver came and realized what a fix we were in and so he told dad we didn't have time to waste and picked dad up and put him screaming and yelling in his wheelchair.  Hopefully the other dental patients didn't think the dentist was hurting dad. But I can only imagine - the whole scene was most embarrassing and I was thinking of not taking him to the dentist anymore except for an emergency - he is 94 after all.  I think many of you remember the incident at the dematology surgery center where dad's diarrhea incident put the men's room ""out of order."" Hoping to avoid a repeat of that - but the Director of MC has followed my advice on his diarrhea problem and says he rarely has diarrhea anymore.  So I'm hopeful.  I think I have everything planned:  Caregiver arranged for - will get confirmation of who on Monday.

Long and short of it he has multiple brain metastases.  Yep -- brain cancer.  They wanted to admit him to do a brain tumor biopsy radiation and chemo.  I said no.  He's 85 years old with moderate dementia for heaven's sake!    The doctor discharged us.  I asked what to do about the pain.  He said ""give him tylenol.""  We were sent home.    I took him home hired 24 hour caregivers from the retirement community's home health agency.  They did okay.  He needed a walker but was still mobile with assistance continent and able to understand me.  I contacted his 3 doctors and asked them to review his results from the ER.  I asked ""Is it time for hospice?""  All three replied yes it is time for hospice.  I signed up for hospice  We were immediately accepted.  Thank goodness-- real nurses!  Dad went downhill quickly and it became obvious he needed a higher level of care.  Assisted Living was now out of the question.  The original agency only offered ""companions.""  He needed nurses.   I hired a different agency which boasted actual nurses and highly qualified staff.  They came highly recommended.  They took over with hospice's guidance.  I tried to get Dad into skilled nursing but none of the places would accept him until hospice could get his pain and agitation under control.  Hospice was making constant changes in his meds  -- take this but if that doesn't work take this and add that and if once an hour doesn't work switch to every half hour then try this but stop that first etc.  It took quite a while to finally find a med combo that worked.  He changed so much in 2 weeks.  He's bedridden delusional has no idea who I am incontinent has seizures and is oh-so confused.  But everything settled into a predictable pattern for a few days.  Now his pain is under control and I have requested to move him to skilled nursing.  I'm waiting for an opening.  It might happen tomorrow.    So Dad is still in his apartment with 24 hour nurses and a full hospice staff to help as needed.  As soon as it can be arranged he will be moved to skilled nursing.  Sounds great doesn't it?  Today I got a call at 2pm.  It was the home nurse agency.  The 1:30pm nurse  had not shown up.  The nurse who was there had stayed but she had a planned medical procedure scheduled and was already late.  She was demanding to leave.  The home nurse agency ""scheduler"" called me and asked if it would be all right for the nurse to leave because another nurse was on her way from a nearby city and should be there in about 20 minutes.  I wanted to scream Are you insane?  Leave a bedridden heavily medicated incoherent and delusional dementia patient alone?  Instead I simply said ""no that is not all right.  Under no circumstances is he to be left there alone.""  She then asked if I could rush over and take over caregiving duties.  I live 20 minutes away myself so I told her that wouldn't help.  Plus I was waiting on a certified delivery and had to be there to sign for it.  Also I'm not a nurse.  Dad's on all kinds of heavy pain killers including morphine.  I have no idea how to administer them.    She asked if I knew of anybody else?  I said no.  I reiterated that he was not to be left alone for any reason.  I find out later she called the director of the retirement community and asked if she could go over and take over caregiving duties for Dad.  Of course she refused.  She's not a nurse.  She doesn't work for them.  She wasn't authorized by me. to do it.  It was a liability issue.  The scheduler is also a nurse and her office is about 5 minutes from my Dad's apartment.  The RC director angrily asked her why she didn't get off her butt and go herself?  End of the story?  The replacement nurse didn't get there for almost 45 minutes.  Imagine if he had been alone that long!   The angry nurse who had now missed her planned medical procedure left immediately when the replacement nurse got there so the replacement nurse had no explanation of meds procedures if he'd eaten where the food was where supplies like diapers and wipes were etc.  Of course the meds were all written-down but she didn't even know my Dad's name!  (Thank goodness it was on the prescription bottle.)  I can't imagine how upsetting this all was to Dad.    I sent a VERY angry letter to the head of the agency.  I made some very serious demands for explanations and how I needed to assured this would never happen again.  I said that I expected to get an immediate contact about this.    So here's praying that an opening in skilled nursing is open tomorrow.",False,RainStorm,2016-07-06,29.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147547448,,,AlzConnected,,,

We fought it as we liked her to be in her own bed however; she continued to slide right out of her bed which is very low to the floor so no falls. Truthfully she should pretty much be in her bed most of the day as she is totally unable to walk on her own and we've been lifting and moving her for about 3 weeks now and we're getting very tired and sore. So the hospital bed. It's set up perfectly in     her room she can see right out to the kitchen table and see us moving around her TV is directly across from the bed and she has 3 big windows on one wall so she can also see outside. But... she wants out of the bed. To go where she knows not just up and out. And she keeps trying! Somehow she slides down to the end and somehow pulls herself up into a sitting position but is unable to get any further than that too weak. She calls out for me all the time. She is tired says it's hard to breathe her chest hurts and now our Hospice physician says she is hearing crackles in her lungs possibly aspiration. I've given her 2 does of morphine so far this morning for pain and breathing problems and hoping to help calm her a bit.

The neurologist says she should no longer be driving but she is. She lives on her own and frequently doesn't take her meds (diabetes blood pressure thyroid) and forgets what she did a minute ago. I've seen her try to take pain med when she just took some and didn't remember taking it. She also fails to pay important Bill's like insurance.  At her regular dr appt this morning I broke the news to her that the court would be contacting her with papers for guardianship. Of course that made her very angry and she says I'm trying to take her house and her money and all of her things. She cursed at me and called me all the bad things she could think of and told me that I'm going to hell.  My question for those of you who have been through this is how do you stay focused on why you are doing this?  I'm obviously not going to be making her life happier by putting her in AL or a care facility.  We have a very nice AL in our town but I'm not sure she'll ever be in a state of mind that will make it a good fit. I hate to move her straight from home to a nursing home environment.  We don't have a MC here.  I can look further away in a nearby city if that's what is necessary.  I'm just having trouble figuring out the best thing to do and telling myself that it's the right thing to do.,False,Mochicory,2019-01-03,13.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147546745,,,AlzConnected,,,

Overall she is content and still somewhat oriented to time/place. She has some arthritis pain in her knees and hip but takes regular doses of tylenol arthritis as prescribed by her doctor.   We had her to our house for dinner last night and it was really striking how unsteady and slow she seemed. She has always been really vigorous! I had not noticed that degree of shuffling and uncertainty when visiting her in MC although she is definitely slower than she used to be.     She did not seem to have any pain: I was watching her face and saw no signs of discomfort. I asked her though and she said that her arthritis was bothering her. I will say though that arthritis pain is her ""go to excuse"" for not participating in things. So I think that her response is somewhat scripted.     So here are my questions:  1) is this shuffling a normal progression of the disease given what stage she is in?  2) if so does this signify foretell that she is going to decline in other areas soon?  3) could it be because she was in an unfamiliar setting? She rarely leaves MC because she gets anxious...do others notice that shuffling/uncertainty when taking your LO out?  4) she has a dr appointment scheduled for May 22. It is with her primary care. Does this change warrant me getting her into the doctor sooner?  I will call the MC facility today to see if they have noticed a decline in her walking.

She also  a wheelchair at hand and staff always responds very quickly to such requests.  She refuses. She also refused physical therapy as prescribed and any kind of exercise program.  They tell her she’ll break a hip or bone have to go to hospital. She says she does not care. Another response: I haven’t been hurt yet. Told she could lie on floor for hours in pain the answer is always some version of “I don’t care” or “I’ll take that risk” or sometimes “so what?” She has already been found on the floor. Not for long not hurt. But. Still refuses help or walkers.  The staff said they told her to think of the pain and problems her getting hurt would cause her family or others she like.

My dad was her caregiver and doing fairly well but she no longer recognized him didn't understand who the stranger was in her house and became increasingly agitated. It escalated to frequent physical aggression toward him so we decided to place her in a facility. She has been fairly content and comfortable and we have seen few signs of agitation since she was admitted. That has slowly begun to change so I scheduled a meeting with her care team.  So far there has been no physical aggression but that is a concern given her history. They suggested a couple of things: increasing her Celexa dosage which had been reduced 4 months ago and Tylenol twice a day. The nursing director said that in over 90% of the cases they have with aggressive behavior it is generally due to pain. They said that they will rule out obvious causes such as a UTI but that patients have difficulty identifying that they are uncomfortable and being able to communicate it and that Tylenol had been very effective for them.  I inquired about their usage of anti psychotics if her aggression worsens and they said that they use them as little as possible because those types of medications tend to diminish the patient's communication skills which are already compromised.

First was mom are you ok with the crayon she circled yes. We progressed from there. She circled she was in pain her legs and back. 60 hrs later finally after threating to go over the head of the unit I had someone who was willing to call the Dr. . THE DR. SAID THERE ISN'T PAIN BUT AGREED TO TYLENOl. ! With all the medical conditions and the fact that it’s been 16 years mom has entered what I believe to be the last of this nightmare. I also believe she is in a constant state of pain. She has trouble sitting at times her breathing is bad her toes are curled and purple. While I feel Mom is suffering and close to dying they say no.

She then will complain about sweating (when she really isn't all that wet or wet at all). Of course she is a terrible ""reporter"" and in the morning can't even remember her leg(s) hurt her. She is in no condition to go through any battery of tests. We do know that she has some fairly minor swelling in her lower left leg that we did have checked out and there is no blood clot there. Her right leg is fine but she complains about them hurting a lot but only in the middle of the night. Oh and we did have a blood test for potassium and other levels and they came out normal. Of course the sweating is just because she insists on having the house kept very warm and always has a ton of blankets on (which you can in no way remove).      I guess this is a long way of saying am I wrong in assuming that some or all of this is just her not understanding or misinterpiting signals from her body?

Recently she declined quickly from living in her own home (alone) to needing help with taking meds going to the grocery store (she hadn't driven in years) and paying bills to 24/7 live in care to moving to 24/7 AL care within one year.  The way someone described VD to me was that it's like stairs where they stabilize then decline a full flight of stairs in one jump (vs a gradual decline).  It's so hard to comprehend and watch my Mom struggle with knowing what's happening to her and yet not knowing how to manage the change.  Sometimes she gets so angry and frustrated.  I'm sure it sounds horrible but sometimes I wish she'd jump another flight of stairs and not know she's straddling her old life to her new life.  My heart breaks for her but at least maybe that way she might not be aware and be in mental pain?  And so I struggle with how much she really needs to have a doctor see her?  Last time she saw her Neurologist was a year ago although I dialogue with him.  She is no longer able to take care of her Health nor Financial situation.  How many drugs does she really need to be on?  She is not taking anything specifically for Alzheimer's/VD.  Mostly what I'm reading is to ask/ensure: is she safe?  is she fed?  Is she rested and calm enough? And the answers are yes albeit she may not agree with that assessment    So any guidance for a newbie with helping a LO with VD?  From what I'm reading of the Alzheimer's scale -- she's in mid-range about Level 4-5 and I'm not sure if that applies to VD as well?,False,MomandMeJourney,2019-01-05,76.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545754,,,AlzConnected,,,

It was not how I expected when my MIL passed from cancer she did what felt like hours of slowing breathing... despite the morphine my moms breathing was slightly elevated as she fought it so hard which I had become accustomed to as I watched her hour after hour after hour for days on end.  So I was sitting on her love seat across from the hospital bed in her room and my Google home play was playing the sound of ocean waves.  The playing stopped... I noted it was glitchy for the last few days.  My husband came in and sat down which was unusual because he is a 'fixer' and had been restlessly cleaning building digging in the garden etc. for days.  He sat down and we talked a little and I told him I had just been to the kitchen to get a drink.  I looked at my mom and noticed she was suddenly breathing softly steady and quiet.  He noted it too and said ""I don't think she will make it another night...""  and he got up and went to the other bedroom to check on our sick cat.  I called to him right away to come back - because I saw my mom take 2 maybe 3 slightly strained breaths...her face kind of frowned and then softened almost to a smile... and that was it.  And a soft breeze came through the window over her head and we heard the sound of an ocean wave crashing.    She was a month shy of her 72nd birthday just 3 1/2 years since her diagnosis (which was quite late I suspect).  She spent the last year and a half in our home and aside from a few caregivers to help with the work days we could not manage with her... we were her primary caregivers through thick and thin.  Most of it thick.  Heartbreaking challenging and gut wrenching.  I learned so much... I grew as a person and my heart that was cracked open with pain ultimately has allowed in more light.    I remember when people posted here that their loved one had passed I felt so much sadness for them... but also a tiny bit of envy... that their LO was free and their struggles were all over.  It is surreal being in that place now.  I am so very grateful to this board as a source of comfort as I navigated the stormy waters of dementia -  in the same boat with you all.  Thank you and bless you all...",False,*brightside*,2015-12-26,182.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147543891,,,AlzConnected,,,

And looks so lost and confused.  It absolutely breaks my heart.  Lately I the past 2-3 weeks he has been starting a bit of aggression.  Nothing major more not complying and getting angry and has reached out to hit only once or twice;  anyways the doc gave us Haldol.  Which is a no no with these patients and I guess I am a non believer in just sedating the poor guy. But when he starts with the combativeness we are giving it a try.   He was so bad last night we gave him two. And the doc recommended; and it has been such a long night.  I felt guilty giving it to him thinking this is more for us all to get some rest but hopefully after a good nights rest we'll all be better in the morning.  Nope.  It's made it all worse.  Will report to doc in the morning.  But man I'm exhausted and if I am this tired and my poor Dad has a UTI HE must twice as tired as me.  He's on Cipro but nothing is showing improvement yet.

291,6210357bc9f833c0c9217b8b,2147544295,2018-11-05 11:35:00,Dreading the Holidays,Before my journey with dementia began I couldn't wait for the holidays to decorate. Starting the 1st of October decorating for Halloween then I couldn't wait for Thanksgiving ( not so much decorating for Thanksgiving) to be over so I could pull out the Christmas decorations and put the tree up and listen to Christmas music. I was always pretty happy during this time of year.          Since beginning this journey with our LO my holiday spirit eludes me. The 1st year we were here I still had my spirit and couldn't wait to decorate. Had to go home and get all my decorations and bring them up here . She never did much decorating just a Christmas village and the linens on the table. I have never seen a tree go up in her house the whole 37 years I've been coming to her house for the holiday gathering. I think it was because she was in rehab and not at home that I felt like I had the freedom to do as I wished.               Last year she was home and I was in a state of sever depression. I didn't want anything to do with decorating and if the DH hadn't put up the tree we wouldn't have had one. I didn't get my Halloween stuff out nor any of my Christmas stuff.                                                                                                        Fast forward to this year again no Halloween stuff and the thought of the holidays approaching is depressing me. I feel the dread of it all in the depths of my soul and would skip it all together if I weren't the cook for our holiday gathering. I'm really dreading all the pain that comes with standing for hours on end cooking and all the cleaning afterwards.                                     I miss the days of having 3 or 4 different places to be and I didn't have to be the hostess at any of them.  Things haven't ever really been the same since my mother passed and his grandmother the year before that. My sister took over our families gathering at the request of my Uncle and I think I attended maybe the 1st couple she did. He died the next year and I took over the hubby's family gathering. Cooking  and transporting it to our LO's house so she wouldn't be alone for the holiday's. At least I don't have to cook and then transport it anymore that's one plus. I have resentment issues over missing my families holidays. No matter how much we tried to get her to come with us she would refuse so I had to give up holidays with my family ( which was about the only time I got to see them) so she wouldn't be left alone with no family. All those years I missed seeing my Aunts that I can't get back and they are all gone now. Even though I have those resentment issues at the end of the day I would do it all again. My Aunts had the rest of my family and our LO has no one but us and our children.     I guess it's because I miss having the freedom to do as I please in my own home that depresses me so (not just during the holiday season). I'm not allowed to move the furniture around or hang things on the walls. I'm don't feel I have the freedom to move about freely and do things the way I want in the time frame I want. I have to sneak around in the early hours trying not to let her see or hear me up moving around before daylight. I have to sit in a dark room in the day while my hubby sleeps cause he's a night owl and I'm a early riser. He doesn't like bright light and I'm the brighter the better. You can't see what your trying to clean in the dark. And she is the same way during the day she doesn't want a light on unless it's so cloudy out that the house is really dark. They both have issues with their eyes though so I understand but that still doesn't make me the light lover a happy camper. I have nowhere in this house to do me always tip toeing around everyone else ( which is probably the reason I became so depressed last year.)       I do know that dementia patients don't do well with change and she already doesn't recognize her house in the evenings.  I also know this is not my house or my stuff I would be changing about. Even though I am told all the time I can do what I want but the things I want I'm told I can't do. It's a never ending cycle that will only end when she does unfortunately.                   Oh well I've taken up enough of whose ever time that might have been reading this.

It breaks my heart that my brother can't accept the diagnosis and is going to make things even harder for us.  His own condition is making some of the worst parts of his personality go up to 11 and it's hard to deal with.  He thinks he can take care of mom.  He can't.  He won't believe it.  My mom has stated repeatedly she doesn't want him trying to take care of her - or his caretaker/girlfriend.  He won't understand.  I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.  And my sister her husband and I are meeting them at mom's house tomorrow - gonna be a long day.  I'm hoping I don't lose my temper again but he does push my buttons.  He says he's in late stage Parkinson's and what research I've done that can cause dementia in him too.  I hate every second of this life right now.  Last night I was wishing I was dead but I know that's not the answer and I can't do that to my other siblings who are on my side and supporting me.  Woke up with a migraine this morning - no surprise there.  Crossed fingers we make it through tomorrow.  Please pray for us.",False,Cam214,2019-01-28,22.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545721,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom has an artificial hip that has 'slipped'.  Surgery is not an option as it is too dangerous (the hip has moved too close to a main artery).    This was diagnosed last year but Mom has been able to continue walking (her body has built some sort of protection around the slipped hip and according to the physiotherapist it's still acting like a normal hip).  She has been getting slower however and sitting on her walker and scooting backwards - very frowned upon in her assisted living facility!    We tried her in a wheelchair but due to her cognitive decline she would keep getting out of it and trying to use it as a walker.  A fall waiting to happen.  The Occupational Therapist vetoed the wheelchair for now as she can still walk.  So after lots of figuring we adapted her walker with spring brakes so when she sits on her walker she can no longer 'scoot' - she has to walk.  Well that backfired on us.  She has had another attack of acute pain the past few days.  She hasn't had this level of pain in over a year.  When she is in bed or in the wheelchair she is OK.  As soon as she walks it flares.    I feel as though I am without help when it comes to this facility.  They look at me blankly when I ask how we can transition her to a wheelchair.  The Occupational Therapist is the same.  She kept telling Mom to use her brakes.  I kept telling her she won't remember.  My friend had her sister strapped in so she wouldn't get up without the help of staff.  I hate that idea (and Mom would too) but what else is there to do?  Mom still uses the washroom by herself but wouldn't be able to with this set up.    Has anybody solved this dilemma?  *Note:  Mom has had so many hip surgeries over the years that using a wheelchair comes naturally to her.  But she's lost when it comes to getting in and out of it - and trying to shift over to the toilet.,False,mostlyme,2018-12-17,286.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545442,,,AlzConnected,,,

We've been laying the groundwork since last spring for this move.And I can’t think of anything more sad and telling about her decline than thefact that she’s oblivious to it all.

I thought I would post an update since I think our experience might help others. So the Dr prescribed 1 mg/3x a day. My dmil took 3 doses (a total of 3 mg) and was basically out of it. Now full disclosure she is not a small woman weight wise....she weighs about 200 lbs. So another call to dr who said drop it back to 0.75 mg/day (0.25 mg/3x day). Well after talking with my dfil and the aide  (dr made it clear we can adjust) we settled on a total of  1.0 mg a day (.025/2x and .5 at bedtime).   Well that was pretty much an epic fail and we go BAD grandma back again at bedtime! So my dh (her son) will be going back to their house again today to readjust meds again. This time we will try 0.5 mg/2x (during the day) and 1 mg at bedtime. I don't blame anyone for this readjustments....it is just another thing to have to deal with. Again.      On top of all this there is the usual things to deal with the Medicaid insurance company has decided to charge us/them for the pooled trust. I already have a pooled trust set up and are already paying them....Had a hard time explaining to them (Medicaid insurance people) that there is their residence and the billing address (my house). I need them to send all correspondence to MY ADDRESS. Apparently this needed special authorization ....so another 2 + phone calls. Then there is the fact that her regular dr is going to run some blood test to see why she seems to be having some leg pain at night. I suspect it is phantom pain but it must be checked out. Thank God the Dr has arranged for the tech to come to the house to draw the blood.      Anyway just when I solve one problem another one or 2 pop up. I'm sure you all understand.  Just thought it might be helpful to some out there about the meds.                           Valerie,False,vaeagen,2016-04-04,153.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545709,,,AlzConnected,,,
305,62103703c9f833c0c92186ca,2147545661,2019-02-10 17:48:00,Pain management issues,I am trying to figure out pain management for my mom and I just have no idea what to do. I apologize - this is going to be kind of a long post…        My mom had lower back spinal fusion surgery around 2007 because she had herniated discs and even had a rupture if I remember correctly. The surgery did not turn out to be very helpful and she had considerable pain and mobility issues after that. She was prescribed a pretty high dosage of narcotic pain medication for it and was on that for a number of years. She eventually tapered back to about 2 pills per day which seemed to be the minimum for her to be able to move during the day and sleep at night. Abuse of the medication was never a problem. I moved her in with me in Florida in 2015 and she was still on narcotics. We quickly discovered that she had to be seen by a pain clinic once per month to be able to continue her prescription. There were times when her pain increased a lot and she was given injections too. I don’t know what her pain tolerance is but she often rated her pain level fairly high.         Her dementia became too severe for home care in mid-2017 and she went into a nursing home nearby. I communicated her medical/surgical history and was able to provide the references for the pain clinic and since the nursing home could give her the meds on schedule she didn’t have to go to the clinic anymore. Then unbeknownst to me the Florida legislature passed a bill in July 2018 that makes it much more difficult for facilities to prescribe narcotics to their patients so she was taken off of her pain medication. I did not know about it until December when during a quarterly care meeting they were naming the medications she is currently on and I just happened to notice that they did not mention her pain medication. I asked about it and it was not on her list. Then someone on staff remembered the new law and said they had essentially had to take everyone there off of narcotics. I spoke to her doctor on the phone and he said that he is not allowed to prescribe more then 3 days worth of narcotics or up to 7 days worth in acute cases or he could lose his medical license. He also kind of lectured me that elderly dementia patients shouldn’t be on it anyway. I said “Well what if they have severe chronic pain and are suffering?” He reiterated that they should not be on it. I found that frustrating because quite honestly at this point it’s more or less palliative care even though my mom isn’t yet at the end of stage. I just want her to be as comfortable as possible. So I asked what else we could do and the only option was a pain consultation at a pain clinic. I said “She can’t answer any questions and she is not going to be able to evaluate her pain on a scale like they ask. How will they evaluate her?” They assured me that they would look for non-verbal cues and things like that. I told them to go ahead and schedule it.         We had the evaluation and the people at the pain clinic clearly had no experience in dealing with someone with severe dementia. They handed me a cup for a urine sample from her and I said “Uh yeah… she is incontinent and is not going to be able to do this.” They said “Oh we’ll just put a plastic catcher on the toilet then.” I said “No you don’t understand. She wears a diaper. She can’t follow directions. She can’t go on demand. I can’t even physically get her on a toilet by myself even if she could. Is there some other way? She cannot provide a urine sample for you.” They said they could do a saliva sample so they did that. Then the physician’s assistant brought us into a room and I explained again that she has pretty severe dementia but also has long term chronic pain and that I wanted to get an evaluation to see if she needs the narcotics or not. He asked her a few questions but she is not really able to communicate - she doesn’t seem to understand what you say to her and her answers are rarely anything coherent. He didn’t really do any evaluation beyond that at all. He just wrote the prescription. Then I asked how often she would need to come back and he said “every 30 days for that to continue.”         Back at the nursing home I expressed that I did not know what to do - she can’t tell me her level of pain or discomfort and I don’t know if she’s doing OK without the narcotics or not. I don’t know if her mental deterioration could make her sensitivity to pain different from what it was before. She can get the medication at the pain clinic but it’s a lot to deal with - the facility has to take 2 staff members drive her across town (because she’s in a wheelchair) I have to take off work and go meet them there and try to speak for her even though I have no idea how she’s feeling because she can’t tell me. She seemed a little freaked out by the drive because she is not in touch with reality and can’t really understand what is going on around her. So I don’t know if it’s worth it to put her through all that every 30 days or if she’s doing OK without the narcotics at this point. It’s also going to be harder on her as she physically deteriorates which is happening fairly quickly.        Neither the social worker or the medical staff seem to know what to tell me and say it’s really up to me. So I’m stuck with deciding whether to traumatize her each month with a drive across town that seemed to freak her out or to discontinue the narcotics and hope she’s not being tortured with pain in addition to everything else she’s suffering (hallucinations loss of cognition loss of physical control). I did ask the social worker to look into whether or not it could fall under “palliative care” and he said he would but we think she would have to under hospice care for that and she’s probably not at that point yet. He’s looking into it.        So I don’t know what to do. Anybody else had any experience with this sort of thing? Any ideas?,False,mobrik,2017-07-04,19.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147545661,,,AlzConnected,,,

All of my sisters came from out of state last weekend. It seemed he would pass last Saturday then on Sunday he was clearer than he has been in well over a year. Enjoying the many visitors. Been very up and down at first but the last three days he has needed a lot of meds to manage the pain and the anxiety. The meds have been very helpful in keeping him comfortable. The staff at his SNF are incredibly caring but they are surprised by how he continues to hold on. For the last two days dad has mostly been sleeping stopped eating and is barely responsive. However when I said goodbye before leaving tonight I told him to pucker up because I was going to give him a kiss and he did. I know he hears everything it just takes every drop of energy for him to just open his eyes let alone respond.  My mom died September 21 2016. Just before her cancer diagnosis my dad had an appointment with the neurologist due to his memory loss and difficulty following a calendar. During the 10 months that my mom declined physically due to cancer my dad's disease progressed quickly. Such a blessing that his decline has been so incredibly rapid. Still such a terrible loss in such a short time. Please say a prayer that my mom comes for my dad tonight so he can finally be at peace.,False,choosejoy,2017-07-03,188.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147543477,,,AlzConnected,,,

We had a lot of fun singing and with the gift exchange. A few days later Christmas Eve she went with hubby and I to my daughter's house where she was lively very funny and ate more than I've seen her eat in months. The day after Christmas I got a call from hospice that she was throwing up and her blood pressure was very low. I spent the rest of the day with her singing to her holding her hand reading funny stories and trying to keep her from getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. (Every time she did this her BP dropped and she went into a feint going somewhere in her head and becoming non-responsive for 10 minutes or more.). She kept saying she was glad I was with her. She couldn't sleep because of the stomach cramps so I finally said yes to morphine for her comfort. It helped but she still kept trying to get out of bed independent woman that she was. As I tried to pretend to sleep in a chair I kept seeing her lift her head to see if I was sleeping yet so she could sneak out of bed.  So funny. Finally 2:30 am I put large items on both sides of the bed and layed down on the floor between her and the bathroom. I fell asleep and at 4:15 am the care staff woke me up to move me so they could get to mom. She was wheezing her oxygen tube was off and her feet were hanging off the side of the bed. She had tried to get out of bed feinted for the last time and never came out of it.  I stayed with her singing and stroking her hair until 5:15 when I left the room to meet the hospice nurse at the front door of the facility. By the time we got back to the room 5 minutes later Mom was gone. I promised myself she wouldn't die alone but in death she was like she was in life: she liked to do things by herself.   You all have been my rocks my go-to when I needed people who understood when I needed advice or comfort. Sometimes I just read without posting because it helped me to know I'm not alone or crazy. I'd love to say I will be here for all of you now and perhaps I will. Right now I don't know.  I'm so very grateful to all of you most of whom have had it much worse for much longer. I'm grateful the end came before mom lost complete ability to walk talk swallow. I'm pissed she was in pain and so sick at the end and grateful it was relatively brief. Thank you for teaching me to enjoy the moments of laughter how to distract how to touch gently and respect PWD how to meet them where they are. I've learned so much from all of you.

Again in the span ofwhat AD is shes not in the final stage I know this but everyone around heragree shes had a sudden decline. We recently went back to the years geriatricsappointment and they did the 3-minute paper test/assessment and the nurseprompted her in places I know they arnt supposed it it annoyed me. And then Iwas told she was right where she was three years ago. Yeah... Im sorry thatanswer is not going to work for me and heres why. I gave them a bunch ofexamples and the doctor was still like oh well as far as the tests show she’sgot the same cognitive functioning. Well maybe if you asked more than a handfulof questions you might see the issue. Instead of asking her to fold a piece ofpaper and drop it on the floor (in which the nurse watched her fold the paperand then REMINDED HER to drop it on the floor). Why don’t you asked her tostand up fold the paper and then drop it. I guarantee you the act of standingwill be all she does. Ask her to write her name on it fold it and dropit. Without reminders she will only write her name and then ask you what thenext thing was. SO FRUSTRATING.  Mom forgot who my daughter was over the summerjust the once. We all went to the beach a friend and his daughter joined us.Mom thought my daughter was one of his kids.   Common sense is declining things I know she wouldn’thave done just in June she does and then doesn’t know why she did. Sometimesyou can get her to talk it out and she knows things but cant connect them to herown behavior. For example we don’t have laundry baskets we put dirty clothingdirectly into the washer. Run it when full. If its running and there was moredirty clothing that did not fit it sits on the floor in front of the washeruntil that load is done. She will pick it up and fold it and try to put itaway.  If I ask her what shes doing she doesn’tknow. If I ask her why do you think those clothes were on the floor? She cantell me they were dirty. If asked do we fold and put away dirty clothes? No.Then why are you picking up clothing you know is there because its dirtyfolding it and putting it away. She has no idea. Its like she no longer thinkswhy are these clothes on the floor there must be a reason. She just picked it upand off she goes… no thought to ‘why’ am I doing this if that makes sense?   And it’s the same thing with soooo many thingssuddenly. Yes over the past few years there were occasions where similar wouldhappen maybe once a month? Now its all day long every day. She wont stoptouching things. Im playing a game of cards with my kids which she won’t joinno matter how much we ask her to. But she will sit there watching and start ‘fixing’the cards on the board moving them around. ‘oh I’m just straightening them’only she didn’t do that at all she moved my cards to another pile. Sheconstantly will tell me she’s doing something that has absolutely nothing todo with what she just did. For example she will go to the kitchen drink somewater and start looking in the cabinets ‘do you need something mom?’ oh Im justchecking the time.  Sigh no your not.And the things she lies about now.. that last example I don’t count I meanmaybe she just forgot what she was doing and there is a clock in there so that’swhat she said ya know.  But the outright lieing… like she has a habit nowof digging in her gums with her fingernails shes already lost a tooth becauseof this which really bothers her but she keeps digging. I don’t think her thinkingconnects the two no matter how many times a day I tell her to stop this isdamaging your mouth. So now if I see her doing it I just touch her hand. Sheknows why but half the time while she’s still got her finger in her mouth ‘I wasn’tdoing it’. Why lie? Her fingers still wet and her hands in her face while shestarts telling me “I wasn’t” There is no upside to bothering with the defensiveness….Its not like a kid trying to avoid a punishment touching her hand is the endof it. I don’t bother explaining why or ‘telling’ her anything anymore. I justtouch her hand while it is in her mouth as the reminder that’s it.   She plays cards with a ladies group they know hersituation. I pick her up at the same time for three years now. But now shepaces gets up and looks for me out the window and trys to get the ladies tocall me incase something is wrong. This summer when the calls started shewould say ‘the ladies are wondering if your coming’ while I can hear themtelling her no we don’t wonder you were worried. “oh yeah the ladies want tomake..No your worried not us -name- stop telling your daughter it is us itsyou.”  She wont sit still. She used to love puzzle booksonce she stopped being able to read novels. Now she might find one word in aword search get up go to her room find a new pencil. Come back sit downmutter to herself might not find anything go get water go look out thewindow… just up down up down. If I ask her if she needs anything its alwaysno Im just… If I ask her if she wants something else to do oh no I have my puzzleIm just…   During the daytime its not so bad but after dinnertime it really ramps up. And she suddenly starts acting like she has a bladderinfection. She goes and pees 4 times an hour. I tried to lock the bathroom andwrote a note ‘you just used the bathroom at Xtime’ thinking it was somehow a memoryissue like she was up and thought oh I haven’t gone I better while I am up.Yeah that didn’t work within 20 minutes she was moaning in her chair making noiseslike she was in pain and walking back and forth to the bathroom muttering toherself I have to pee ohhhh god I have to pee Im going to pee myself. Shedoes not have a bladder infection (I have the test strips) and she can sleep forhours at a time and next day was fine. During the evening shes back uppacing going pee a bunch.   Some days it feels like she doesn’t do anything butfollow what someone else is doing. She stands in the kitchen staring at thewall while I do dishes shes not even trying to talk to me she just standsthere. Will follow me into the living room and ‘pretend’ to do a puzzle book butreally is just staring at me while I read or watch tv or whatever. If I amstudying (yeah I went back to college) she will pace behind me try to readover my shoulder and pretty much do a litany of things that really bother thesh*t out of me and make it impossible to finish my homework.   But anytime I try to get her to do an activity tokeep her busy she will only do it if I do it with her or possibly she will startto do something but it lasts 15 minutes top.  And I mean simple things like coloring acoloring page. She goes to a senior daycare program 3 days a week and everyonethere says she doesn’t exhibit these behaviors at all. But the activities theydo are typically the same things she does here so wth? Also anyone elseannoyed by the hours of these programs? ALL of them here only do 3 days a week9am-3pm. Who does anything where those hours work for them? Its veryfrustrating everything about this is.   But her sisters are finally on board after a fewyears of bitter behavior on their part so that’s a plus. But it came down to mespelling out really clearly that I understood perfectly they were the onestaking advantage of me in this relationship. None of them will take her andnursing care is expensive and none of them WANT to have to be in charge ofkeeping up with her needs. I made it clear that they could behave and have someappreciation OR they could be salty and treat me like I was inept and alwayslooking for an angle to get moms money (HA!) and I would start packing moms thingsup and they could just tell me which of them I was driving her U-Haul truck to.FYI they are retired so not like it would affect work life or something. I onthe other hand am in an accelerated college program work as a tutor am asingle mom to two busy teenagers one with her own mental health issues and I volunteerwhen I can for my own sanity. But you know those retired sisters couldn’t possiblyfind time to balance Moms needs… yeah okay I am salty about it. Hahaha   So okay I rambled on (thanks for letting me) doesthis sounds like sun downers (I have a book somewhere I keep meaning to read)or is it something else? Just common progression of AD?

When I last posted I had just returned from one of my monthly week long trips from MN to MD (November) to be with Mom and things were okay. Not great but ok. Since then I've sent letters to my 3 siblings to give each of them an idea of what is going on and to encourage them to call or visit when they can. My sister her dog and her boyfriend visited for a week in December and with the 3 page ""Mom Manual"" I provided had an okay visit. This sister has worked in Assisted Care facilities here in MN and provided some good observations on Mom's behaviour. My brother is currently finishing up a week long visit today and is also ""woken up"" to Mom's state of being. He did some good research while he was there took care of a getting a few bills on auto pay that I hadn't managed to take care of yet and probably most importantly made the final decision on mom driving anymore. He said he didn't want her to drive anymore and was looking for a lie to tell her. I came up with telling her that her license expired and the state wouldn't renew it. Not a complete lie as her license  does expire in a couple months and as MD has gone to RealID getting her a new one would be a significant pain (you'd think someone in government would realize that people in their 80's might have a hard time providing a copy of their birth certificate and marriage license but no).   Otherwise I came to the decision that mom can't be alone anymore. Not only because I worry all the time and spend at least an hour every day on the phone with her. It's primarily cause I can tell how utterly lonely she is. So.... I made the decision to move out to MD to stay with her and try to start clearing out her house for a move back to her beloved MN. Then my sister (the one with assisted care experience) said she is at a change point in her life and would be happy to move out as well. Yay! I don't have to do all this alone! So now she and I are finalizing that plan and are looking towards moving out in the next few weeks. Once there we'll start the long process of going through stuff getting a definitive diagnosis and planning the next step.  You might notice that I've mentioned my brother and one sister but not the 3rd sibling. She is still in denial and the rest of us have decided not to involve her further unless we need to. She'll be kept in the loop but won't be asked for advice... she has a user/abuser mentality and none of us really want her trying to use mom at this point in her life.

The doctor called yesterday and said it wasn't her thyroid and wanted us to admit her into detox for a pain med she is on that she shouldn't be on with dementia. She stressed to us that it is so much worse with a dementia patient than a regular person when they are tapering off.  We really don't want to and everything has been fine until today. My husband took her to stay in her home for the weekend since the weekends are the only time that we can take off to her house to stay with her. While we were packing stuff she swiped more pills. I have been keeping a strict count of them since the doctor said to do that. I counted them again after we thought we caught a glimpse of her near the box they were in when we walked back in the room and sure enough there were some missing.   I had a talk with her and she started crying saying that she promised she didn't take them and that she would never lie to me. I explained that I didn't think she was lying but that she may have forgotten she got them. She looked through her purse and ""found"" the missing ones but started blaming her son for putting them there.  Now they are on their way to her home over 3 hours away and he is miserable. She won't talk to him and she is saying that he is trying to put her away so he is making her look guilty.   I am at my wits end right now. I love my husband dearly and by default care for her. We have never been close and through much of our marriage she has treated me badly. I wasn't even invited to holidays when my FIL was still alive. She would tell my husband to come but leave me at home because I wasn't welcome.   I don't want her to have to be put into a detox facility but this is getting harder and harder and we are only just beginning on this journey.   We also have to deal with constant smoking in a non smoking household. She never asked if it was ok. She just started lighting up as soon as she walked into the house. She bought a brand new carton around 4pm Tuesday after seeing her doctor and as of today (Friday) she has only 4 packs left. I don't even know how many packs are in a carton but that is excessive and stinking up my house.  Her other family members have scattered and we are all that she has to take care of her. We don't mind but she is not happy. She just doesn't want to be in a different state than where she was born and raised. We are unwilling to move back.   Is this normal behavior? The doctor told her that she was lucky to have me because I am the one that called her about the problem and I don't have to be there. The doctor told her that I was only there for the ride. So far she has not turned on me and is looking at me now as the authority figure. She is taking everything out on my DH. I am waiting for it to turn at any moment since she has never cared for me to begin with. I took her baby is what she has said. He is 42 years old and she got mad at him last night because he got married and moved away. She said he should still be living at home at his age and that a child is supposed to follow their parent not the other way around.   Sorry for rattling off. I have a weekend to myself and I should be happy about that but all I can think about is my poor husband and what he is going through since she is mad at him and blaming him saying he planted her pills in her purse so she would get in trouble.",False,rowcod1116,2018-10-21,6.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147544153,,,AlzConnected,,,

I want to pick out a gift for myself - suggestions?,"Hello old friends   I haven't posted for a long while.  My mom moved from her community's MC / AL to skilled care March 2017.  It was quite an adjustment - her behaviors escalated evaluations were done meds were adjusted.  She is at Fisher's scale stage 7.  Double incontinent non ambulatory speech that generally makes no sense frequent hollering and carrying on during hands on care regardless of the caregiver's approach.  I believe she still recognizes me as her daughter and she sometimes says my name.  She is being well cared for.  Eight years ago when - unbeknownst to me - Mom was beginning her Alzheimer's journey I decided that whenever her words or actions set a new record for inflicting pain I would treat myself and / or my daughter to something really nice (at my own expense.)   It's my home-made silver lining to a permanently crappy situation.  It's time to plan another treat.  A few weeks ago when in spite of her verbal skills being practically zilch she managed to get out the full sentence ""I hate you!"" while taking a swing at me.  The trigger was wheeling her into the bathroom to wash food off her hands.  No sympathy required.  It is what it is.  I only want suggestions for treats.  First time Mom set a wounding record I splurged on 2 pieces of jewelry for me and daughter.  Second time it was a short trip for the 2 of us.  I'm thinking concert tickets or a new sets of luxurious sheets?    What kind of treats have you all given yourselves recently?  If the answer is ""none at all"" maybe you can join my alchemy experiment where we attempt to turn crud into gold.",False,CodyW,2013-04-05,867.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541758,,,AlzConnected,,,

When I finally get my mom to go to bed and stay there I'm to mentally exhausted to post but I do read posts very often.  To those who may have read my last post I had mentioned my dads stomach pain as well as coughing and chocking while he eats. He had an endoscopy last Friday his results were given to me right after the procedure by his surgeon He has a pretty severe infection in his stomach so the doctor put dad on two rounds of antibiotics to clear it up and he began those today. His esophagus does not contract when he swallows his food to push the chewed food down so he is also on Prilosec. So these medications in combination with all his others is just more for me to keep track of! It is a good thing I have OCD and I'm very organized otherwise this would be a hot mess!   On a different note my dad has become very very impatient. He was so embarrassing in the waiting room that I could feel my face turning red. I kept asking him not to talk so loud and to quit complaining about the wait. Well that did not work after about the third time I ask him to whisper he yells real loud....""My daughter says I'm talking to loud am I bothering yall"" SERIOUSLY?? He has no filter says inappropriate things and can be so obnoxious and rude about ""waiting his turn"" I know this is typical of ALZ patients but sometimes it is too much. Everyone could tell that he was not ""all their"" so they all laughed and answered him and said ""no"" while looking at me with pitty in their eyes. He likes attention my mom babies him and he is rotten however very sweet too. This condition has really changed his personalty in a lot of ways and in other ways I still know he is in their and can be perfectly fine. The changes though are starting to come on faster now I still believe he and my mom both are in late stage 5 maybe early stage 6...I'm not sure about that it is just a guess.  All they can do for themselves is bathe toilet and eat. My dad has a cane he uses all the time now and my mom holds on to things when she walks or goes up and down steps. If she is in the yard though she seems to be fine (she likes to help me outside sometimes). From all that I have read and researched I'm very thankful they still have control of their bodily functions. When the time comes that they cant or are unaware of their surroundings I'm going to have to hire help. I don't know when that will happen I just pray it wont happen to both at the same time. That would be too much for me to handle I believe. Well anyway this post was just an update no questions this time....Oh and my grand daughter has been here since Sunday and we have really enjoyed having her here. She will be here until Thursday and she really lifts their spirits as well as mine and is so sweet.

It seemed to go fine but a week later very suddenly and quickly (in the course of a couple hours) her face swelled up to the point her nose was crooked and she couldn't speak right. She is stage 6 and did not report any pain or discomfort when asked but clearly the infection was bad and could have had consequences if we hadn't been alerted by exterior swelling. She was also very fatigued when the facial swelling happened. She did 2 weeks of antibiotics and the dentist said to wait and see if it happens again he will need to go back into the tooth. How do we know before it's out of control?  I was thinking we may need to buy a thermometer that works without her needing to follow directions since a fever may be one sign. Would I be able to tell by looking if I can get her to cooperate? I'm not well versed in root canals having never had one.    On a side note how do you handle dental work in the later stages? Do you do things like root canals? Do you decline procedures? How do you know if it will cause pain without? Do you have them removed one by one as they cause problems? She did ok with the procedure but I fear this is the start of many issues since it's hard to maintain good dental health/brushing.,False,MN Chickadee,2014-09-07,1405.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147544068,,,AlzConnected,,,

They say to give it time but the guilt of knowing she is sad and struggling is immense. The predictable thoughts of is it the right place and right time. Would another facility be handling her better or have more luck with distraction. Could we have waited a bit longer. And on and on.

In my sister's case she never lifted a finger or contributed a penny to help my mother in the 10 years of my caregiving yet is self-righteous judgmental petty entitled and antagonistic toward me. In my father's case (mom's ex husband) he has financially helped a little just recently but it's a tiny fraction of the help required to properly take care of my mom and a tiny fraction of the financial capacity he has. Meanwhile he has routinely indulged and incited my mother's dementia making her extremely agitated suspicious and uncooperative with me and therefore making my life hell. In addition he has profoundly insulted me talking through her (she repeats what he says as if it is fact) saying I have a ""spending problem"" (ie money that has gone into successfully healing my mother and successfully healing myself from various health conditions) that I am after her money (infuriating since I have given her everything I have and then some - she gets a pittance from the government which is not even close to enough for her basic needs) and that I am after his money (patently untrue). I am exhausted infuriated and feeling my energies hijacked - diverted from postivity and healing toward warding off their evil.  Ideas for Response Moving Forward: I just came to the end of a particularly exhausting week with three 911 calls in three days. Two of those calls were related to violence and two ended up in hospitalizations - one for a urinary tract infection that got to the blood stream and reuqired a week's hospitalization. During that time my mother accused me of abandoning her in the hospital (despite having just spent the entire night there and left at 4 am) and of telling everyone she's dumb (I tell everyone she's super smart). In addition she punched me and numerous nurses and otherwise was a royal pain in the a**. She deteriorated in teh hospital refusing to eat refusing to drink refusing meds and refusing to be changed despite soaking in her pee.   Meanwhle I called 40 AL and MC facilities. Only 5 accept Medicaid out the gate. Most of those have 2-3 year waiting lists and typically take people from inside (private pay that transfers over). The rest require 2 years of private pay at the tune of about $3k/month. I have worked my a** off for the past decade putting all my resources into my healing and my mother's healing. My sister meanwhile accumulated wealth. My father already has wealth. They don't do what they can and they point fingers and make my work that much more difficult. It's exasperating and overwhelming and exhausting.  In addition the one place the social worker miraculously found - a lovely 6-bed home with a single room available and an owner who seems deeply compassionate and heart-centered - declined taking my mother because of how she seemed at the end of her hospital visit. This despite my having told the owner that my mother had deteriorated in teh hospital. Regardless given my mom's behavioral issues - which are the exact reason I am desperate to find a facility - it's unlikely that a Medicaid facility will accept my mother. Keeping my mother here feels dangerous to my health given taht I'm healing naturally from cancer and that doing so requires keeping my stress levels low and my joy and peace levels high.  Last week I disconnected my mother's phone so that my father could not incite her anymore. I am thinking that I'm now going to write to my father and sister and tell them that they will never see or talk to her again unless and until they step up and cover the cost of an AL or MC facility. I have spent my life giving EVERYTHING to healing my relationships with my family or origin and helping them individually heal. I think I need to surrender and accept that this is who they are and no matter how hard I work and how compassionate I feel these people will remain toxic - and therefore unsafe for me - because that is who they are. It is profoundly SAD. But I think it's time for me to stop holding the bag of their shortcomings and to set some hard boundaries and demand - DEMAND! - that they step to the plate or else they do not get to continue feeding off and exploiting all my devotion and sacrifice for my mom.

I hope I have the courage to come back and support/help/listen/laugh/cry when it's over.  The quick story:  My mom has declined quickly since August when I last visited her as ""Mom"" (I live in New Hampshire: she's in Wisconsin). After that trip she got very sick (which I've written about before) end of September and October. I rushed home again: this time to stay with her in hospital and then through first week of rehab (all day not nights). Though she has been declining cognitively the past year in the hospital in October she was weak but peaceful and we could interact hold hands tell stories exchange our love. She was different in rehab but still Mom: ever more confused but ""still Mom."" We could laugh and cry together.  I had to leave her after a week (I'm blessed that brother and sister are close by and do all they can for her: they are wonderful). Still in rehab (bad facility) cognitively she started to tank: ever more confused belligerent scared frustrated. Shortly thereafter she ""fell into"" (or was launched?) into full-blown psychosis: paranoid hallucinations delusions complicated by cdiff contracted in hospital. My sister and brother yanked her out of that horrible place and got her into memory care but she grew wilder more aggressive scary out of control.  The doctors gave her one dose of Seroquel and she was out like a light for two days so they took her off. Since then decline is rapid: she's losing a pound a day her doctors approved hospice she's very weak so no longer a threat to anyone she's not talking comprehensibly she doesn't seem to have any affect emotionally. We can't talk on phone for more than a quick mumbled ""I love you"" (and I can't even really hear that).  The memory care folk are compassionate and wonderful. Last family meeting (yesterday) with doctor they decided to end all medication including blood pressure well butrin etc. All. She's on a pain patch. She seems comfortable my sister and brother tell me just very far away. The doctors and my family don't think she'll make it to the end of the year.  Here is my dilemma which I'm almost ashamed to say out loud: Do I spend the money to go home for one last visit before she passes? My brother and sister say that she's so distant it's not worth the energy money and emotion to try and visit. They worry it will be too hard on me. They said they need me to save my money for the trip to the funeral which is when THEY will need me (I've been able to provide extensive respite in the past). I would be leaving my husband completely alone for an unknown time which I KNOW my mother would not want. She always made it clear that immediate family (husband/kids) were the priority.   I'm really struggling. I have some vague hope that I'll be able to bring her ""back to life back to Mom"" and then I think I am in denial and I need to take care of my family and my work. My relationship with her has always been close so I know she and I have said all we ever need to say to one another and still I panic and blubber when I realize time is running out.  Any insights/opinions/experiences you have would mean so much to me. This whole day I have cried myself into a fierce headache: tonight I have only the energy to wait for your thoughts even short quick ones. Go. Stay. Help.  On this Thanksgiving I am grateful to all of you always understanding out there in the unknown but we are connected.

Would love to swap stories and strategies and offer ideas and encouragement. Here's my story:  I have been scared recently. I am healing holistically from cancer and doing a bangup job of it. The thing is a key ingredient has been stress management - ousting toxic people from my life living in the forest spending time dancing playing music and journaling...  My self care regiment has been compromised since bringing my mom to live with me for a host of reasons - one of which is that there are always people in my house now (mom caregiver) and it interferes with my sense of peace (especially because peopel come and ask me things and need stuff from me frequently) and also becuase of time issues. Even with a caregiver on board every day now (a major blessing!) I still put in hours a day on managing my mom's care.  In addition I just always feel a sense of I don't know agitation or lack of safety in my space. HOnestly I want to bolt half the time (or more - I joke about leaving my mom the house and moving into a studio apartment just to get the heck away!) Anyhow I just read in another thread about how caregivers end up with a host of health issues of theri own. That is not cool. I don't want to be one of those statistics.   My mom is a complete and total pain in the a** and I know that as much as she emotionally attacks and puts me down all day every day I do an incredible job taking care of her and nobody at a memory care facility is going to support her like I do. But...what about me? What about the fact that my stress levels are through the roof that despite being by nature a happy  positive optimistic person I am now consumed by rage and darkness and hatred?   In the beginning I was ace at turning this into a grand spiritual lesson. I kept asking ""What's the opportunity here?"" And meditating a lot. But I think I have caregiver fatigue now. And the worst part is my sister and father who don't do anything useful but hang around on the sidelines making everything worse inciting my mom manifesting chaos in my home.  Anyhow I'd love to hear other people's thoughts about protecting and optimizing our own health and how can we do that while caregiving for a loved one with dementia?",False,pearlhansen,2018-11-18,104.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147544472,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was not alone and got prompt attention.  First experience with a cast luckily her nondominant arm. Pain management - she denies pain but will take Tylenol ""to help the pain stay away.""  Now if I am there she won't do anything for herself.   If I am late arriving in the am  she will do a few things like putting on underwear robe and slippers.  Her cast is a light splint and leaves her elbow free.  She now won't even try to open a house or car door.  She wants to be fed if we are alone!  When we are out in public then she is much better.  I know at stage 5+ she probably should not be alone at night but will not allow anyone to stay over.   And if she knows the hired caregiver will be arriving the next day- she works herself into a weepy state- including going back to bed refusing to get up.     However if she gets angry then she can do all kinds of activities that were normal before the break.  I am concerned about the next 3 or 4 weeks and how to encourage her to do more for herself now.  She allowed herself to collapse into the floor this morning rather than reach for a pillow that fell from her lap.  She walking much more slowly head down even when the splint is off.     Suggestions welcomed.  Thanks much S",False,ImSombody,2018-11-03,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147544458,,,AlzConnected,,,

I know being there was the right thing and I am deeply grateful to all of you who advised me to go. Afterward I realized that even though I held her in my arms as she was dying her soul ""MOM"" had already left (we think Saturday). Still I could hold on to my family and they could hold on to me and my brother and sister both said she waited for me. They've both been through hell caring for her and they feel mainly relief: I know I will and I am that her suffering didn't go on longer but for now I am either empty or burning inside with a pain which really has no words. I am waiting to feel her in my heart and soul again. I have felt my Dad (who passed suddenly in 2000). Her suffering is over. Now I wait for peace again and to feel her with me once more. Again I am so grateful to you all and I hope I have the courage to keep coming back here and helping others as I have been helped. Sending love and thanks and wishes for peace for all of you.

During that meeting the question that I never wanted to hear was posed to me. They said “Your mom does not have a DNR (Do not resuscitate) order.” My reply? I said that I know and asked them why they brought it up. They said at her advanced age and with her stage of dementia that it is the compassionate thing to do. Not to mention this heavy conversion took place the day before Thanksgiving which is the day we give thanks for our family and our many blessings.   I know what a “DNR” entails but I did not know the extent that the orders go into. I did some research as well as some soul searching. I talked to family and friends and was told that it is the compassionate thing to do.  As long as it’s the nice thing to do it is also the hardest.   I then started asking questions almost telepathically to children who had signed this order for their parents. We’re bonded almost cosmically. ""How do you get your mindset past this road block? How to you sit there and watch your love one pass along when they get so ill that they need to be on a breathing machine? How can you claim to be a loving daughter and sign such papers?""  I don’t have the answers but I do know that I watched both my uncle and aunt slip away from me while I was sitting there holding their hands all within 30 days of each other. At that time I knew it was the compassionate thing we could have done. I also see other patients in my Mom’s ward that have gotten sick been kept alive and now cannot feed themselves cannot talk. Basically their quality of life has left them.   I know that I don’t want that for my mom. Is this selfish of me? I don’t know but I want my mom’s quality of life be as good as it can be she can still enjoy music being with family (In small groups) and of course the Bruins.   So on Thanksgiving I gave myself a break from all this and enjoyed my time with my Mom. I counted my blessing to have three generations of family in the same room. Today is other day and yes I signed the paper and will have to make peace with it because it is the compassionate thing to do even though it does not feel like that now.   ​This is just my opinion and the place I’m at with my Mom.

She loved the cottage but her dementia and isolation was causing delusions and wild hallucinations.    Her lack of balance was terribly worrisome  since we have no way of installing remote cameras with our rural internet service and she refuses to use walkers.   She's had 2 trips to the ER within 2 weeks which required stitches in her head and many other falls not requiring professional medical intervention.   She also quit trying to prepare meals for herself because she does not remember how to operate the kitchen equipment - except to set the dish towels on fire.   Although when questioned she would say she made her meals.  She didn't know what she had eaten and there was no evidence of anything cooked or eaten.   In addition to my new duty of preparing all her meals my stress level has sky-rocketed because I never know if she is laying in a pool of blood from her latest (and not remembered) fall and injury.   I found her immobile on the floor during one morning visit and her tales of hallucinations during her night on the floor would have made a great horror story.   I felt so bad for her but she still insists she wants her ""privacy and independence"".   I pay for one of the emergency alert systems which she absolutely refuses to use.  It has fall-detection and everything but she sees no need for it since she doesn't realize she has any problems.   I work at a (fortunately) part-time job with a very understanding boss and my husband is severely disabled with back problems and chronic uncontrollable pain so my available time is limited.  In our rural area home-health care looks sketchy at best.   I've never read a good review of that prospect in our area.  I'm not going to waste limited resources for that.   After a few heart-to-heart and heated discussions we agreed that she would move to a nice big apartment in an AL center about 10 miles from my home. She visited and approved the facility.  Mom has the resources to afford this for a few years then we will take over the financial responsibility.   The apartment is as big as her cottage so she lacks for nothing except the full kitchen which she couldn't use anyway.  We bought her new furniture to supplement her existing furniture and took a couple weeks to outfit it with all her pictures and favorite stuff.   The stress of the moving day (12/1/18) was high but she was right on board with helping everyone and was in a good mood.   When all furniture was in place and boxes were ready to be unpacked she warmed up to the unpacking and organizing procedure.  I was soooo happy that things were going well.  I spent about 7 hours with her that day getting things sorted out and properly placed.   I had a warm fuzzy feeling about the whole thing.    I escorted her to the dining area for her dinner then she released me to go home.   Then the next day happened..........dementia is back with a vengeance.    Today turned out horrible.  I showed up at the scheduled time of 9:30 to take her to church.  One of the aids told me that she did join them for breakfast.  When I visited her she chided me for missing breakfast and told me what a great meal I missed.  I explained that I'm not included in the breakfast club so she accepted that.   She decided that she was tired and didn't want to join me for our church service.  I stayed with her for 30 minutes to make sure everything was OK which it was then I went to church.  I told her I would be visiting her mid-afternoon to hang some more pictures &amp; etc...   What a surprise when I got there.  I asked her if she enjoyed her lunch.  She said she did not go to lunch because she was busy.  (none of the weekend aids could confirm the lunch attendance).  She was in the process of un-doing everything that had been done.   Packing clothes and keepsakes in any available box and ready to move out.  She didn't have any destination in mind but just knew she couldn't leave all her stuff there when she moved out.   I could not distract her in any way from her goal of packing up her belongings and leaving.   I just tried to keep up with her by unpacking all the boxes she had packed.  She was so focused on packing that she didn't notice that I was unpacking.  I kept trying to impress upon her that this was her new apartment and she was staying here.    Then one of the aids came to escort her to dinner.  I encouraged her to go and she did.  While she was gone I fast-tracked the unpacking and hanging favorite Christmas decoration all over the place.  When she got back it seemed that the dinner distraction was successful.  We watched a bit of TV then I went out for a 5 minute break in the cool air.  When I got back she was in full re-packing mode to move out - still no destination in mind.  I should be ashamed of myself but I told her that if she continued her packing with intention of moving out she may be moved to an MC facility where she will be locked in with no privacy and independence.   I just don't know what to do or say now.  I'm terrified of what tomorrow will bring.

She was walking independently but having more and more trouble going up the 4 steps to our house.  Knowing that things would only get worse we put her on a waiting list for a memory AL nearby in a Continuous Care Community that was associated with her Adult Day Care. My MIL is also there in the AL portion. Mom was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and was due to get her first dose of Prolia the next week.  Then we got the call...Mom had fallen at the Adult Day Care and couldn't get up.  They think she may have caught her foot on a chair leg or something and down she went.  They had called the squad and would meet us at the hospital.  Long story short it was a hip fracture they pinned it the next day and 2 days later sent her to rehab.  Luckily she was able to get a bed in the same CCC.  Yesterday they graduated her to a walker after 11 days of working up to it.  Physically she is making progress albeit slowly but emotionally she is up and down.  She calls out frequently when I'm not there although that's starting to lessen.  She usually can't tell them what she wants since she forgets by the time they come in so they take her to the bathroom give her pain meds as needed reassure her. They had the psychiatrist see her yesterday about her anxiety. He decided to hold off on meds since she seems to be improving on her own and let them continue to have her sit in the group area more instead of in her room trying to keep her occupied with her favorite puzzles I brought from home taking her walks in her wheelchair all of which seem to calm her. I'm good with that since she takes so many meds already for BP etc.) They also increased her bedtime Trazadone to help her sleep better and said that may help her in the daytime too.  Surprisingly she seems cognitively about the same - it's just the anxiety and off and on depression. She gets frequent visitors from family and friends and that does seem to perk her up.  I know often they decline quickly with the anesthesia and all but so far so good on that front.  It's so weird and sad not having her here at home but a little bit of a relief knowing that I don't have to be the ""bad guy"" in moving her to a facility. They said she can stay on the rehab floor (private pay after Medicare runs out but still...) until a room becomes available - hopefully soon.  Originally we were hoping for the Memory Care AL but that depends on her progress.

Dad was just diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome - and he's had the symptoms for more than 5 years.  In 2013 he broke his ankle and I took him to/from all the doctors appointments for that and shortly after in 2014 mom was diagnosed with AD.  So most of my attention was given to her issues and I had to put dad and his issues on the backburner.  Now I'm trying to get him help for his constant back pain numb hands (just diagnosed as CTS) balance issues etc.  He uses a walker to get around the house due to his back pain/balance issues and I have questions regarding CTS surgery and using a walker.    Thus the reason for this post  - to find a message board more suited for non-AD elderly person concerns.  PS:  Mom is holding her own - still never got back to the baseline prior to inadvertantly discontinuing her Namenda and Aricept back in late May - but is manageable for the time being.  While I've been in the next room for the last couple of hours this morning mom got up once to go to the bathroom but a few minutes ago got up again - and had placed her gait belt around her bottom.  I helped her get back in bed after taking that thing off.  lol.  Almost time to go wake her up again to start the day.",False,romiha,2014-12-21,564.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147543360,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have read books articles medical websites blogs from caregiver and patient perspectives and all kinds of subjects here in this forum.  Well read but still feel unprepared for my DH's changes lately!   We went to ER for chest/back pain.  The EKG showed abnormal but not a heart attack so they kept him over night for observation.  He couldn't eat after midnight in case they needed to do a procedure.  They didn't take him for a stress test until nearly noon the next day.  It also showed abnormal so they said they would do an angiogram the next morning.  So after midnight he couldn't eat again.  They took him in at 1pm next day.  No stents needed!   He hasn't been the same since we've returned home.  He's had more confusion and is overly tired sleeping much more than he had the week before.  His right eye was seeing double bright lights and he was dizzy with and without headache afterward on and off for 3 days.  We went to the ER again (his doc's request since it was late afternoon)  They did a CT of his head to check for brain bleed because he is on blood thinners.   Showed normal! He is smelling smells that aren't there....which is weird because he had lost his sense of smell!  He is struggling much more to understand what is going on around him.     My question is....  could the chest pain hospital visit lack of reg eating (low blood sugar) have caused his VD to accelerate?  Could the eye problems be from the VD in the occipital lobe?  What causes him to smell things that aren't there?   Thank you!,False,Tape Lady,2017-11-13,24.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147543043,,,AlzConnected,,,

The nurse asked her how long it's been off and on for 2 years! Since before she moved here. What??? I know some of this could be related to her disease (remembering time frame incorrectly for example) but of course I've been looking on the internet for the causes of blood in urine. Since she doesn't have abdominal pain or extreme pain when urinating I've decided it must be cancer...am I the only one that does this?

My 86 year old mother in law finally got a diagnosis of dementia from her PC but she has been exhibiting symptoms for a few years. She still lives alone and most friends and family do not realize that she is having cognitive problems. She is a very social person and when she is around people she seems much like her old self. It is when she is alone that her symptoms increase.  I visit her about twice a week to take her to the grocery and assist her with bills sort her mail etc. I also make sure she gets to her various medical appointments and drive her wherever else she wants to go. In addition to the dementia she has limited mobility and cannot see very well due to macular degeneration.      Being with her more than the rest of the family I see the things they do not see. With her sons I think it is that they do not WANT to see it or admit that it is happening.      She is experiencing Sundowners most every evening now and insists that my husband stole her car. Reality is that she gave it to him over a year ago. She's angry agitated and threatening. In the first call I got tonight she threatened to kill herself said she had nothing left to live for. The next call was from a police officer who she called to report the car stolen. She's angry agitated depressed and lashing out.      I spend more and more time trying to maintain her finances and reverse the things she buys. She ordered a home alarm system but insists she didn't despite letting the company install it. It's been a lengthy battle to get them to let her out of the contract they are threatening to sue her. She gives out her banking info to anyone who asks for it over the phone. It's a constant battle to undo the damage from people who prey on the elderly.      A couple of months ago I arrived to take her to the grocery. She met me at the car and we went on our way to do the shopping. (Even though I have told her countless times I will assist her in getting from the house to the car if she will just wait for me). When we got back I opened the front door to the overpowering odor of gas. She had left the stove on with no flame. I can't believe the house didn't explode when I put the key in the lock.      She is very stubborn and refuses to have in home help. We have tried that and she fires them. Even though she tells me often how she doesn't think she can ""do this anymore""..live alone when I bring up the idea of moving to assisted living closer to us (I live 30 minutes drive time from her) she refuses to even think about it.      My husband and his brother are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. The brother lives a good distance away and is NO help at all. My husband doesn't want to understand any of this and prefers to think she is just being a pain in the...well you know. Every phone call is a screaming match despite me telling him it does no good because she believes what she is saying is real. She doesn't remember giving him the car. He keeps trying to get her to remember.      What do I do to get these men to help their mother? I've suggested every option I can think of and they basically ignore me and ignore the worsening situation.",False,Jerney,2015-03-20,13.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147514123,,,AlzConnected,,,

He has a broken sacrum which is contributing to the problem but this anxiety/aversion to care had started prior to the fall which resulted in the fracture. He is on Ultra (Tramadol) and now the MC is seeking an anti=anxiety med. I keep asking them to ensure they approach him before touching or moving him and explain each step but I think they do not take the time necessary to be very careful and thoroughly explain. Even if I help out he is in pain but I can keep him more calm by explaining each step. He also does not want to eat much when others try to feed him but for me he eats the entire meal. Yet he often is unsure who I am.   I'm looking for approaches to suggest to the staff for his care because he is shrieking out in pain currently and they are unable to change him adequately.,False,sixteenpaws,2013-10-23,45.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147542677,,,AlzConnected,,,

So now gotta run to let the dogs out throw on some clothes and wait for them to arrive. . . moments later they were here and helped to get her back in bed as soon as they left we're up. So now she's sitting in her recliner and a Hospice nurse shows up 1 1/2 hours later nurse leaves.      Feed her breakfast give morning meds and her brain is going a million miles a minute.  Trying to convey something or another but I can't make out a word she is saying or what she's trying to say. This goes on and on ALL DAY.      Up to the bathroom wants to go to bed wants to get out of bed wants to sit in recliner wants out of the recliner. . . while in the recliner she's talking away God only knows to who or what she's saying.  Back out of the recliner to the bathroom to the bedroom out of the bedroom.    I tried everything I could think of to get her to shut down for just a little bit music stories her robitic kitty a real dog the birds (she blind so I described them to her) more music different music tried to get her to sit with me and ""watch"" a movie still nothing calms her down.  No nap today she usually takes two naps a day dear God all I wanted was a little time for me just a little.    Working a full time job (we have caregivers while I'm at work) and only having weekends off but not really having weekends off because she's my other job. . . I'm exhausted frustrated angry and tired.  At 9:20 PM she's still going off. . . now it's to her deceased older brother asking him for something (still couldn't make it out)  This new behavior has been going on since the beginning of the month.    Yes she's been checked for UTI she just got back home from being ""evaluated"" for 10 days at Hospice House geez that was a nice 10 days but it wasn't long enough.  While at Hospice for the first time in the year that she's lived with me she asked about her parents brothers and my father.  The following day she started seeing people in her room kids a police man . . . so now I know the hallucinations are starting. When she got home there was a very pretty lady standing in front of the window.  Thankfully the hallucinations aren't scary ones and I'm able to keep them pretty benign and positive.    I'm sorry this is so long. . . now my brain won't shut down and it's 11 PM and I'm just trying to get a little bit of quiet ""me time"".  *sigh*  Oh and I've got her sheets tucked in so tight I pray she can't get out of them until I'm able to help her out of bed. . .

356,621041e17b65de9a5b65c332,2147542432,2018-07-11 13:28:00,Update from a post I made another tear welling moment,It's been an eventful 4 months for me. LO is still about the same. Her memory is a little worse but nothing significant has really changed with her condition. Its still so sad to listen to her wishing and praying to be better knowing she is not gonna get to the better she wants to be.She wants to be able to take care of herself and do the things she used to do and it will never happen until she goes home to heaven and leaves her earthly ailments behind. So sad but true.                                                                                               As for my situation. I finally started trying to get a grip on my own health issues. I went to my regular cardio checkup and let them switch me to the once a day med and have not missed but a couple or three doses in the last few months compared to only getting one dose twice a week when I was on the twice a day pill. Yea me. I also went for my yearly physical which I skipped last year. I asked my PCP for something to help with my depression and anxiety on an as needed basis and he gave me some hydrOXYzine (generic for Vistaril ) but said it probably wouldn't do what I wanted it to. I have yet to take the 1st one to try but my depression has gotten better. I am trying not to let things get me down and have a more positive outlook. Heart doctor added a new med to my regiment and I was doing good about taking it with my other morning meds until they called and upped my dosage to include a night time dosage. I still cannot seam to get those night time meds in me.                                                                               PCP sent me to Urologist because of the issues I have had with my bladder. She put me on something for urgency and frequency and I started it at night along with the pravastatin for cholesterol I've been suppose to be taking for years now and haven't. Well I got severely constipated and landed myself in the er to get some relief from the pain. They gave me something for my pain and nausea and a breathing treatment and released  to go have the testing done I already had set up for later that day. DR. said those were the test he would have ordered and since I already had them set up he would release me to get them done.      Urologist had me scheduled for a  Cat scan which revealed a small mass on my left kidney. It was the constipation putting pressure on the mass that was causing the pain that landed me in ER. Been for an MRI and Renal Ultrasound and had a Cystoscopy performed yesterday. I go next weak to find out the results from  that.                                                                                                                                 On a more positive note I finally got a little respite. I got to attend a family reunion about 800 miles from home and took my youngest son and the three grandchildren with me. We all had a wonderful time except I got to feeling bad the last couple of days and my blood pressure spiked probably from being couped up with the three grands( ages 457)  in a car or hotel room for 4 days straight. Had to rush home to get the pre-surgery( for the Cystoscopy) testing done had to be there by 5pm and I walked in the building at 4:45 talk about cutting it close. And to top it off if nothing happens between now and then the hubby and I are gonna get to leave town for 5 days in a couple of weeks so he can get a much needed break which means I get two within a months time.                                                                    Please keep me in your prayers or well wishes that whatever it is on my kidney is not something really serious and if it is that it's been caught in time to remedy.,False,mabeene,2017-06-12,266.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147542432,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her legs are like logs and her CGs while she was still living at home (she's now in MC) noticed an angry blood red rash (it looked like cellulitis) on her shins. She went to the MD they gave her something topical for the rash that was used but since her move to MC the edema has gotten worse. The skin on her shins is now splitting oozing and infected. The MD (who is very good) saw her at the facility gave her antibiotics and tylenol for pain but what she really needs to do it wear the darn compression stockings. She refuses!! If she continues to do this the infection could obviously progress and could become very serious. Worse case scenario she might need to be hospitalized which would be catastrophic because she gets terrible delerium. I know I'm getting ahead of myself with the hospitalization scenario but I feel so helpless to help her.  I am trying to have a hands in the air attitude of well not much I can do and we'll hope for the best but expect the worst. I am pretty emotionally overwhelmed as she just moved about a week ago and I'm still dealing with that working and am supposed to be preparing for a vacation (long awaiting and deserved) that I'm taking next week. I doubt me visiting her (she's about 35 minutes away) and encouraging her to wear the stockings would change anything- she'd probably refuse me too.

However I am an elementary teacher with a demanding job. My solution was to place mom in a health care center.  In the last year I had to move mom every 6 month due to her aggressive behavior. Yesterday she had a crisis where she pulled her roommate's leg to pull her out of the shared room. Also later that evening she hit another roommate after being move to a different location.  I went to the center and discus possible solutions like mother might be wet might be tried might have a pain somewhere. These questions wasn't asked. She was only responding to mother's actions. The RN didn't have a clue. I asked about mother's meds. such as what type of meds. was she on? After reviewing the sheet I noticed that she didn't have psych meds. There lies the problem.  Mother has been at this center since June 19 and for less than a month mother has had no psych meds. I gave the RN mother's psych meds when mother was admitted to the health care center and the RN stated the she couldn't take them. She said that they were to order them.She didn't order all mother's pysch meds and because of this mother went into a crisis.

My mother and husband have dementia and I’m the solecaregiver I’m 78 years old.    My mom has been blessed with great genes and excellenthealth.    She will be 98 in November. Whenher husband died she was left penniless and I asked her to come live with us.    She has Medicare and Medical now but has notused these services because she hasn’t been sick as far back as I canremember.    I noticed a change in herbehavior in 2012 when she stopped writing on her diary and began hoarding.    I sent her away for a few days and got rid ofmost of her hoarding when she came back and realized that her closets wereempty she threatened me to call the police for elderly abuse.    I started talking to her about the TV showthat she missed and she forgot about her missing things. She stopped bathing bythen she says that she will die if she got under the shower.    All these years she says that she is spongebathing but I never find any wet towels or any mess in her bathroom.    To make it short:    I made and appointment with a GP just to havea doctor’s name in case she ends up in a hospital.    The GP referred her to a neurologist to takethe dementia test.    The neurologisttalked to her and said that all she needed was a supplement called RediMindthat is sold over the counter.    Imentioned to him the hoarding the obsession with any kind of paper wearing asweater in 100 degree weather and her fear of bathing.    He said that is normal with people withdementia and that was it.    I still don’tknow if she will get any help from Medical in case she lives long enough andgets very sick.    By the way in the last22 years that she’s been living with me I’ve only given her Tylenol twice whenshe had a leg pain.    She has never takenany medications except her one-a-day vitamin.   She eats very little and doesn’t believe in diets. Sometimes I think thatshe is from another planet.    My husband who is 92 is a WWII veteran.    He receives medical treatment from the VA andis well taken care of.    He was diagnosedwith dementia a year ago and his health is declining slowly.    He still takes care of his needs and has goodand bad days.

365,621042ad7b65de9a5b65c883,2147537198,2017-10-23 00:28:00,3 weeks of diarrhea...,Yes my husband did have a fall 3 weeks ago and the diarrhea started soon after that. Before the fall it was just the opposite. He fell because of his crippling osteoarthitis in his kness and back. He has been x-rayed for any bowel obstruction nothing his stool has been tested for c-diff and for other gastro infections nothing either.  Even though he is eating only once a day now binding foods I might add he is still having profuse watery diarrhea. Now what he is taking everyday that I believe is the culprit is Aricept. I have been reading everything I can on Aricept and found out that 40% of patients who take Aricept develop diarrhea. And it may not be right away either it could be 2 yrs after you begin to take it. Which is just about the same time my DH has been on it. Also he began taking Namenda in March but was recently weaned off of it due to his worsened joint pain. So my theory is this I think the trauma from the fall and possibly the removal of the Namenda at the same time somehow changed the way his brain responds to the Aricept causing him to develop the diarrhea when before the fall he had no side effects from it.  I'm going to ask his neuro dr tomorrow about cutting him down to 5mg a day instead of 10 to see if that helps with the diarrhea. I realize he will have to be monitored closely for the smallest sign of cognitive decline if we do cut back to 5mg whereas we would go back up to 10mg immediately if we observed any decline whatsoever.  We've got to try something our life cannot continue on like this....,False,Vivilynn,2017-08-15,215.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147537198,,,AlzConnected,,,

Also I apologize in advance if I say anything that's upsetting--- This is my first time on the forums and I know I'm surrounded by people who are under a lot of stress and are very sensitive to pain.    My mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2008 and died around six years later--- In early December 2014. She died at age 57 or 58. It seems apparent to me that she actually  had  the disease or at least the early hallmarks of the disease for almost four to six years before that when I was a teenager. There was a time in 2004-2005 when inexplicably she couldn't remember what we had read together with only a week delay between readings. And that wasn't a weird occurrence back then--- I just assumed she was kind of a spacey person. Imagine my surprise when I discovered the sort of thing she did in her early 20s---- She wrote brilliant psychological dissertations. Painted gorgeous paintings. After Mom's diagnosis I longed for access to that mother. ....In many ways I only knew her for ten years. :/   ....Dad who knew the healthy woman a  lot longer than I did says that the Alzheimer's Disease started--- get this--- around the age I am now. Late 20s--- 27 or 28. It wouldn't be remotely diagnosable at that age but the downward trajectory might have begun. The slow mine car ride down into Hell.   So...I am  deathly  afraid of getting it myself. It haunts me an anxiety aching in the back of my mind the ghost of my mother's disease taunting me with every slip of the tongue and forgotten name of a video game character. With all of my bad sleep with all of my exhaustion with every circumstance in which I perform even slightly less effectively than I did when I was just a college student living with my parents. I'm a lawyer working in a demanding job for a non-profit now--- Of  course  I can't match the level of energy I had then.   But still.  Still.  In my mind lies the shadow of my emaciated sick mother having lost every single thing that I value--- Health happiness a sharp mind creativity strong passion and emotion the ability to produce the glory in writing and art that have always been present at the most joyful moments in my life. In my mind lies the glittering memory of my youthful mother--- Vivacious and funny with a taste for historical fiction and dramas about women living in complicated times who used to take me on trips to theme parks and walk me through the dewy grass and earthly smell of the boxwoods in her favorite gardens. And I fear that in me too in barely thirty short years the latter will become the former. Tick tock goes the clock and there is never enough time.    So I come here in an effort to find what I'm supposed to be looking for. To hear from those with the accumulated wisdom born of the nightmare my family too faced. How does one spot early-onset Alzheimer's disease? What happened in your family members that precipitated the loss of memory and the steady decline of cognition?   ....how can I determine how long I have left?,False,Shenmue654,2016-07-21,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147527923,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom is in late stage 6 Alzheimer's and is wearing a cast from a broken arm from a fall last Friday. We are paying extra for someone to sit with Mom ""hip-side"" during waking hours to prevent her from tearing off her cast and to help her walk (she's dizzy from pain meds).  My FIL showed up at her room to visit yesterday at 9AM (her first day) and she was sitting alone with her cast torn off and sitting on the floor. Family was in and out all day and didn't see anyone with her once. We were furious and talked to the woman in charge who said there was a misunderstanding and assured us there would be someone with her at all times. She tore her cast off again later. Her doctor has now put on a special sleeve to keep her from tearing it off (hopefully).  Her room was messy. The trash was overflowing and there was used toilet paper in the laundry basket. In the 45 minutes we were there we saw the same RA take two smoking breaks.  We got a call at 12:30 AM from the facility saying Mom was hitting people and yelling and they could't get her changed out of her wet clothes and Depends. They said if we couldn't come down there to calm her they would call the ambulance and take her to the ER. My husband jumped in the car and was able to get her back to her room and to take her meds.

She attends an Adult Day program 4 days a week and so far is doing pretty well with all of this.  Last week her PA ordered a Dexa Scan just to check and it showed signs of osteoporosis.  She is suggesting Prolia for her.  After reading online reviews the possible side effects are concerning to me. Most concerning is severe arm and leg pain and eczema. Presently she has no pain at all and has had severe eczema in the past. In fact she still has bouts of eczema that I can barely control with topical medicine. Also concerning is the fact that they warn if she stops taking it her chances of a spinal fracture actually increase. Also if she gets this injection and does have side effects there is no way to reverse is as it is long lasting (months).   I understand that osteoporosis increases the chance of a fracture with dire results should she fall and there is a good possibility she will fall at some point and I would feel terrible if that happened. But there is also something to be said for quality of life too. My brother and sister and I have discussed this a lot and are all thinking it would be better to skip it and just continue with Calcium and Vitamin D.  Has anyone on here had any experience with Prolia or any of the other medicines given for osteoporosis?

Per the subject of this post my Mom and I are at a loss as to how to deal with my Grandmother's current symptoms. She was diagnosed about two years ago with VD but things have been pretty status quo up until recently. Background on Grandmother she is an incredibly independent 85 y/o woman who has done everything on her own until her diagnosis. Getting her to accept help has been one of our biggest struggles which is why my Mom (and me to a lesser extent) has been taking on the primary caregiver duties. She says that she'll be in her condo until the day that she dies so there's that.  She has been taking Aricept and Nemenda since her diagnosis and everything has been okay. She had a fall in March trying to get back into bed and broke her tailbone. She was in a lot of pain and bed ridden but recovered enough in a few weeks to gain back most of her normal function. She moves around very well (she's honestly more flexible than me) although we still help her with stairs just in case.   She has short term memory loss and asks a lot of repetitive questions but long term memory has essentially been untouched. She does have some ""obsessive"" behaviors mostly just looking for something VERY specific (like an address or a piece of paper with info on it). She also gets very overwhelmed in social situations and has a difficult time making decisions.  Our main problem right now is her itching. It is ALL OVER. She changes clothes multiple times a day because everything is ""itchy."" She moisturizes like nobody's business and is constantly using Sarna and anti-itch powders. We have changed soaps detergents and anything else you can think of. She takes occasional Aveeno oatmeal baths. She drinks plenty of water as well. She has seen a dermatologist multiple times as well as her geriatrician all who have suggested multiple anti-itch solutions but to no avail.   My mom decided to wean her off the Aricept a little over a week ago to see if that might be the cause of the itching. The itching didn't seem to be a thing when she was just on Namenda. When she saw the doctor last week they put her on a steroid pack to see if that would help the itching but it didn't (and I'm convinced it made her even more on edge).   Now she's at a point where she doesn't want to continue living in her current state. Now the itching has turned into stinging in some areas. I have been reading a lot of posts on here as well as doing my own research on itching. I firmly believe it is part of the disease progression as a lot of the topical remedies and pills (Benadryl Zyrtec steroids) have been unsuccessful. She acknowledges that something is ""wrong with her brain"" and says she could handle that if the itching would just stop.   I suggested to my Mom that we should probably start her back up on the Aricept because I don't think that was really the cause of the itching. Does anyone have any other suggestions as to what to do/who to see? I saw some people posting about Gabapentin which I think could be worth a try. But we don't want to keep throwing pills at this sweet woman if they aren't going to help and ultimately will make her more miserable.  Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I'm scared to death that I will have it -my mom has it my grannie died from it at age 94. I read the boards almost nightly trying to learn as much as possible and I post occasionally. Lately I feel like I'm posting more than I should. Don't know why I feel that way but I do. If I have ever hurt someones feelings with one of my post I sincerely apologize. That is never my intention.   I have read recently about using the following terms ""a shell of a person"" ~   ""she/he is healthy with the exception of having Alz/demtia~  ""a broken reasoner""  I am guilty of using all of the above. I am truly sorry if I have offended anyone. But my beautiful Mother is just a shell of her former self. I hate this disease I hate it for what it did to Grannie and now Mom. I hate it for what its doing to your loved ones too. And to you and your family and friends.  My parents are here visiting for a ten day stay. My heart breaks for my Dad. He doesn't get a moments peace. He does it all! He even makes it a point to bring Mom out to eat at least twice a week he brings her to get her hair done and brings her to church. He drives 8 hours so they can visit with me and my siblings about every 3 to 4 months. She is becoming so unpredictable and inappropriate. Her personal hygiene is terrible and is always a huge fight leaving everyone in the house a nervous wreak. Yesterday I sat at her feet and said I'd like to trim your toenails. She wanted no part of it. Her nails were so long they had to be causing her pain. She was truly scared I was going to hurt her. I kept reassuring her I was being as careful as possible. Afterwards she would NOT let me file them. Her finger nails are bad too. NO WAY is she letting me do her nails. She believes she has already taken a bath-they have been here 7 days and she hasn't taken a bath until tonight after a big argument. I've been watching Teepa video's BUT we still have the same issues. sh--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! blahblahblahblahblah. I'm having the same problems everyone here is having. Banging on the table with her fork and knife saying feed me feed meeeee- that one makes me want to scream. Last night she asked me for the 100th time whose house are we in. I told her calmly that its my house. She doesn't even remember my husband died. Every night she ask me if shes spending the night here. I calmly say yes and I have to show her to the bedroom. I know she knows something is wrong with her. I hate this for her. I feel like she has been stolen from herself and from us. As far as the terms ""quality of life"" and"" the golden years""  that's been stolen from her too. I am angry mad bitter and pissed off.  Her mind being stolen isn't bad enough she has to smell terrible too.

Is still talking to us. Has periods when she knows us. Talking to God more. Was put on Methadone because of her pain twice a day. This medicine is at a low dose. She is resting more. Momma has periods of passing out. I can’t remember the medical term. The lack of oxygen to the brain. It’s happening more and more. All due to momma’s declining health. The Hospice will be coming three days out of the week.   I am hurting to bad. My daughter is taking it as bad as well. My sisters are here with me to help with momma. She is now bedridden. She wants to get out of bed. The last time she passed out. We pray over her. Play her Christian music. It does comfort here. I guess. I was naive thinking the time would never come. Seeing momma in pain shouldn’t be. I try not to cry in front of her. It’s so very hard. I get in bed with her. We talk. I pray for her. Just hold her and listen to her breathing. I tell how much she is loved. Always be with me. How I will miss my precious momma my sweet angel. I love her so much.

375,6210438d7b65de9a5b65ce77,2147541699,2018-06-03 10:58:00,Mom's journey has ended(1),"Where to begin.  First thanks to everyone one this forum who has helped me to cope with my mother's Alzheimer's disease.  This site has been a blessing beyond words.    My 93-year-old mother had been falling a lot - 18 times by my count.  Her last fall resulted in a broken femur just below her hip (probably broke there rather than higher because she has an artificial hip).  That was about a week and a half ago.  The staff at her MC called me about the fall but said she was fine.  I visited her that evening and she was more agitated than usual and was clutching her leg.  The hospice nurse came and told me she may have broken her leg.  The next day she was assessed by another nurse who agreed the leg was likely broken.  They moved her into the hospice care center to get control of her pain and hopefully be able to send her back to her MC.  As I left the hospice care center the day she was admitted I said ""I love you"" and she said ""I love you too.""   That was our last exchange.  The next day she was mostly unresponsive except for chanting ""right right right"" which she had been doing for months at her MC.  I was told she had about 3 - 5 days to live.  She spent 9 nights in the hospice care center and passed away yesterday afternoon.  I moved into her room and spent the last 7 days at her side.  I stroked her hair told her she was the best mom ever and that I loved her so much.  She was given a lot of morphine and it helped to keep her calm and her breathing somewhat regular.  At one point I was concerned that the morphine not the broken leg was killing her.  The doctors and nurses assured me that for some reason when a person her age with dementia breaks their hip (or upper femur) it is a terminal event - and that she would pass from this with or without morphine.  They said the morphine would not hasten her death but would take away her pain and help her to cope with the loss of oxygen that comes with dying.  The goal was to keep her comfortable and the morphine and an anti-anxiety medication did just that.  The hospice staff were absolutely wonderful - the most caring and attentive people I have ever met.  The facility was built with community donations and was beautiful - high quality furniture lush gardens cared for by volunteers original artwork throughout - just a wonderful place for both mom and me to spend our last days together.  She was a fighter.  The staff told me numerous times that she had minutes to hours to live.  She lived another day beyond when everyone thought she would surely go.  I was talking with a CNA when I looked over at her and saw she had stopped breathing.  Perhaps she did not want to pass with me right by her side as I had been for a week.  I was able to stroke her hair and tell her how much I loved her as she took her last breath.  What a blessing.  Now I am struck by the intensity of my grief.  As many on here know I wrote posts with topics like - ""the never ending journey.""  I visited my mother at her MC almost every day for 15 months.  She was on and off hospice since December 2016.  This disease robbed her of her ability to play piano play bridge and read - the things that made mom mom.  Instead she became boy-crazy self-absorbed and needy.  It seemed the roller-coaster would never end.  And there was one challenge after another - the boyfriend I cared for as his family lived far away the tears mom and I shed the day she moved into MC her loss of appetite - and most challenging - her extreme anxiety.  Seeing her pushing her walker into the locked door and saying ""help me"" ""please help me"" and - ""I don't want to go"" and ""I don't know what to do"" over and over was just heartbreaking.  Now she is at peace and I am so very sad.  I will miss walking into her MC and seeing her sitting there food all over her face and in her lap as she attempted to feed herself and the staff giving me an update on her latest exploits (getting up and down all night long whether or not she was eating whether her anxiety was under control).  Visiting her was a huge part of my life and it is over.  Now I will remember and honor my mother as she was before dementia took her away.  The hardest thing is knowing how much she loved her life and did not want to die.  I feel guilty that I am here and she is not.  One of the last things she said when she was first admitted to the hospice center was ""how long is this going to take?""  The nurse thought that meant she was aware that she would be dying but I know otherwise.  She wanted to know how long it would take to heal get out of there and get her life back.  But her life was already gone - I need to remember that.

I have met such wonderful caring people along the way. I have read so many stories on this forum and I realize how many people are struggling just like me. My mother was so difficult to deal with bringing me to my knees in tears at times. I perservered and walked by her side. At one point I told her that I just couldn't deal with her but no matter what I would take care of her. We walked the path together but separate then as the disease took  another turn I held her hand and grew thicker skin and gained further knowledge and walked with her again.  I received a call last Wednesday night that my mother had a stroke. I drove the 8 hours to be at her side. I held her hand and told my mom how much is meant to me that I was her caregiver and that I was honored to walk the path with her.  I thanked her for being my mom and that I loved her. Not being able to open her eyes or speak she squeezed my hand. All of the difficulties of the past years of Alz fell away and I was with mom. On Thursday at 6:30 my mother past this life and she is at peace.   My friends our struggles with our loved ones will end someday. Gone will be their struggle their paranoia their delusions and we will be left with knowing that we did our best. I am filled with sadness of her passing joyful that she is with God and no longer afflicted with this bazaar disease and relief with the burden being lifted.  She is whole again in the sight of the Lord. The pain of the last few years will fall away and the memories of my mother and our family will take the place of the difficulties of demented mother..   Thank you all on this forum. You all in your struggle have helped me to cope with this illness. I don't know how I would have handled my mother had I not found this group.

Starting last Friday she was convinced that ""the nice doctor from EMS"" was going to come by to check up on her because her leg was still hurting (it was a muscle strain and a bruise she was able to walk on it). She stuck with the delusion/perserveration into Saturday and into Sunday morning. In an attempt to satisfy her internal need I called EMS to come evaluate her. They checked out her leg agreed it was a muscle strain asked if she wanted to go the ER. She said no. Mom was agreeable with the paramedic and was quieting down understanding her leg problem wasn't serious. Then the paramedic took her vitals as SOP...and her BP was 180/100. They insisted on taking her to the ER for evaluation (no history of high blood pressure)     Went to the ER BP came down by itself ER doc not concerned. Xray of her leg was negative doc said it was a muscle strain will take about 2 weeks to resolve sent her home.     Yesterday she started up with ""the ER doctor said he'd come by and see me"". I explained to her that he wouldn't be coming that since she was OK if she needed to see anyone it would be her PCP. She said she didn't want to see her PCP.     Today got a text from the aide that she's still talking about the ER doc coming. I called her and said the ER called me they read her xray everything is OK so there's no need for any visits. She got agitated with me saying she has pain so something *must* be wrong. I told her to take 2 Tylenol (aide will give pills).     I put in a call to her PCP to talk about these peserverations/delusions he hasn't called me back yet (I have an appointment to talk with him about mom next Tuesday)     And 2nd reason why I'm freaking out: I called the ALMC place decided to re-visit and meet with the clinical staff ""just in case"". Turns out they have availability. I told them about the PCP meeting next week and I scheduled a visit for Friday the 15th.     I'm not ready for this...and I'm not sure mom is ready either. She's stage 4-5 will be aware of the move. And it is upsetting me that I would be taking away the things that she is able to do on her own in the house and putting her into a completely unfamiliar environment where she can't make her own coffee or walk around the house that she's known for 50 years (remember mom is legally blind so she won't be able to see much in a different place)     Intellectually I know (eventually?) moving her is the right thing when she's no longer safe...but moving her because of an emotional/psychological issue that is difficult for ME just seems...selfish on my part.     I'm rambling at this point sorry. I  know I still have several steps and processes before making a decision but I am jumping out of my skin right now.     I will also be filing FMLA at work for intermittent leave",False,SelEtPoivre,2018-03-08,825.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541753,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom was fine. 10 minutes after we left they called.  Mom fell and hit her head.  And she could not get up by herself.  They were calling the EMTs. So we turned around and headed back.  I got to ride in the ambulance but forgot to ask about playing with the lights &amp; siren. Eventually they took CTs of head &amp; neck and X-rays of lower back &amp; hips.  When she came back she was in a lot of pain.  Most I have ever seen.  Plus having an anxiety attack.  Thought a broken hip was the problem but had to wait.   All pictures came back negative.  A while later she was agitated about going to the bathroom.  Had to go “right now!”  Long episode short moving for bedpan caused pain trying to walk with walker to toilet caused pain. They had 3 nurse/aids trying to help. Did a sonogram of bladder.  Ended up with straight cathader.  Almost 700 ml later feeling better.  And determined a UTI.    There were no symptoms I could recognize even from my readings here. So a bit of a surprise.  But glad we got to it.    She got a room since she couldn’t walk.  So 1:45-10:00 in the ER.  From learning here I knew it would go better if she had one of us with her overnight.  Arranged it with the charge nurse and security.  Brother took first short shift till about midnight. Son took 12-4 daughter 4-7 wife 7-10.  I did my shoulder PT took daughter’s dog for 1.3 hr walk breakfast shower.  Went to MC for her hairbrush toothbrush &amp; a fleece jacket for mom.   We just had lunch and that went well.  PT came before I got here but mom did not do so well. So we are waiting until his afternoon’s session.  She can’t go back to MC unless she is ambulatory.  MC’s rules.  My fingers are crossed.    It has taken me almost 40 minutes to type this.  I know how to type but I get a few words and have to do something for mom.  At least it is Sunday kids don’t have to work.  So we again will work in shifts.  This way no one gets overwhelmed.  Luckily my wife is off this coming week.   Not how I expected to spend Father’s Day.  Hope you all are having a better day than I.   Greg  P.S. one of the arms of my glasses just broke. I’ve fixed this pair twice before but this break is the spring part of the hinge.  So I guess I’m looking for new glasses this week.  Just putting more on my plate!,False,greggarten,2017-02-08,982.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541988,,,AlzConnected,,,

I will be honest I am not blaming anyone but itreally feels like Hospice made things go quicker.  I can't say if that'sgood or bad but if anyone read my other post there was a push for morphinethat I said no to.  There was a push for stronger pain meds which I triedto explain was going to take her mind away from me faster.  Mom couldconverse on day 1 to 4 of Hospice but as meds were taken away and others wereadded her body wasn't thrilled with that.  I knew in my heart that wasgoing to be the case.  I met with a doctor on day 3 and there was a pushthat liquid med would be beneficial.  Mom was eating just a tad on day 1and 2.  Every time I asked if she wanted something to drink she said yesso ginger ale and 7-up were in her if I was there.  I can't say how thecaregivers in her community were doing it but I know of course she wasn'tgoing to eat and drink for them the same.  Anyway the doctor was kind but moved her to oxyalone (that was our compromise) and once mom's Tylenol and antibiotics weregone so was she.  I am having a little pity party right now because Istarted the grief process with acceptance and then went to anger and thenbounced around.  This morning I woke up thinking she should have been onPalliative care why did I move to Hospice so quickly blah blah blah.  I am sure many of you know how this goes.  Wemake decisions based on the information at the time and then sometimes we goback and question stuff.  Intellectually I did it the right way. Mom wasn't a young person we weren't working to save her life and I trulydidn't want to see her move past her stage 5 of dementia.  Emotionally Imissed her yesterday for Mother's Day and would have liked if she wasn't takenoff some meds and put on others when she could have just went to sleeppeacefully (in my mind).  We don't get to write the script and I am sureHospice can be helpful and comforting but for me... mixed feelings.,False,Rockym,2016-01-17,939.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541334,,,AlzConnected,,,

Do for others what you want them to do for you.  Go to Sunday school.  Don’t complain.  Be a good.  Don’t get into trouble.  Visit or call your parents often.  Recycle.  Be good to the planet.”  Some of these rules teach us basic love and kindness for others but there is something we can’t ignore.   God wants our hearts.

Home health was told all this and it was going to be told to the doctor. It’s a scary situation when momma has a hard time swallowing. It’s such a helpless place. Momma’s walking has gotten much worse. She refuses to use the walker or wheel chair. My biggest fear is momma falling. She never walks unassisted.  So hard to see this. Momma has on occasion talked about death. Tonight was different. She told me she knows her time is short. God is coming to pick her up. She wanted to talk to all her children on the phone   I called them all and they talked to momma. As I have shared before there is so much chaos in my family. I recorded momma wishing she could have all her kids together.  She had me promise to make this happen. I sent this recording to my siblings. One would hope this promise could be kept. I love my momma so much. The thought of not ever holding her and simply being in her presence leaves with a heavy heart. I know this isn’t living for momma. Every day I see a decline. Others are going through this and are feeling the same as I. I’m just so sad and scared at the same time. I don’t want this to be over. Yet I know God will take momma home where there will be no pain. The tears just keep flowing. Loving my momma hurts so terribly. She is my best friend who has been my pal for so many wonderful years.

Since January Mom has insisted that she and her live-in caregiver go to the same restaurant every night. According to the caregiver who I have every reason to believe she insists they both have wine and then she gets sloppy tipsy. (Mom never held her liquor that well.)  The issue came up last week with the doctor and social worker (both kind geriatric specialists) who gently then with increasing urgency tried to coax Mom to minimize the drinking to 1 glass a month as a celebration thing. Mom was super defensive and got surly. My sister and I have tried to alter the pattern by fixing meals and coming up with a plan for the caregiver to have food ready. But Mom insists and then gets belligérant when any of us push back. “It’s my money my life she works for me nobody can tell me what to do” etc.   Clearly it’s a pattern where she’s either self-medicating and/or forgets the doctor’s advice. We lost our dad — her husband of 65 years— three years ago. I can’t imagine how lonely this must be for her how going out helps dull the pain. Still the caregiver doesn’t want to be there every night to endure this it’s not cheap and certainly not healthy though of course at 90 who can insist on certain kinds of health?  So what options do we have?  Thanks much.,False,Pommette,2018-05-15,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541359,,,AlzConnected,,,
388,621044827b65de9a5b65d4d2,2147541491,2018-05-22 10:06:00,Answers/Suggestions,i had posted previously any ideas on the Megace and didn’t get much replies. I know all are busy and are dealing with their loved ones as well. Momma has acid reflux due to the Megace. We did discontinue. She has horribly flares up which can last a good hour and half. We were told to give her Mylanta. She has had 3 episodes of the pain in her chest and throat. The nurses have reassured us it is not her heart. Seeing mom in pain during that timeframe is so upsetting for her.  The doctor is suppose to call in something else for the acid reflux. Momma is very weak. The nurse came yesterday and said momma is a little dehydrated. Not enough for an IV. Stays in bed more. More difficult to open her eyes. Just a drastic change in momma. You can be talking to her and she conversing back. Before you know it momma is out. Harder to wake up. Do it gently so not to startle. The nurse said this is all because of her weakness. My brother the doctor told me he doesn’t see momma lasting a month. Upsetting to hear. I know the day is coming. Time just went by so quickly. I listen to momma breath at night and I think back on her many restless nights. I will miss our times together. Just never enough. I stayed home with her today. My last week and my supervisor has been wonderful. Momma tells me she is leaving with God. Hardest thing for me to do is release her to God.  My daughter and I are so very close to her. She is our world. We live with momma. I am her momma right now. I wouldn’t change this for the world. I know I won’t take it well when momma goes home. My daughter and I will hold on to to those precious memories of dear momma her Momo. Letting go of someone you love so dearly is so hard. Our love is a love that will never leave. Momma tells me that she doesn’t want to leave me. I told her we will see each other again. My precious momma.   Gina,False,gcortez,2017-04-10,132.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541491,,,AlzConnected,,,
389,6210449e7b65de9a5b65d585,2147541146,2018-05-03 23:46:00,New issue with my dad,"My dad thinks he is the boss and that he is ""running the show"" so to speak. He is being argumentitive and difficult to talk too. I have learned that I can't reason with my parents that is a waste of time and emotional energy. For those of you who may not know my husband and I bought a little over 40 acres 45 minutes from where my parents have lived for 18 years. There home was way to small and this farm has two homes on it ( though I havent moved into my home yet just next to theirs.) I was just having trouble with my mom with this move now that I have her on the right medication she is so much better. She still wants to go back to ""her home"" but her fits of rage have stopped for the most part. She still gets angry but not like before well now my dad wants to go back ""home"" as well. My husband does not live here full time yet because we havent sold our home in Colorado and he can not retire for 3 more years. He will actually be flying in tomorrow and I havent seen him in about 6 weeks. He will only be here for 5 days full days but I'll take what I can get. So I said all that to say that I have this responsibilty all alone pretty much. I have used Visiting Angels twice and I love them the same lady has come both times and my parents really like her. Those two times I had appointments and errands to run but I was able both times to eat lunch alone and look at facebook. That was nice anyway I had an appointment today for my dad and I underestimated the amount of time it would take me to drive to the appointment. So I called them to tell them I was still 15 minutes out so I had to reschedule. This appointment was really needed my dad has bad back pain due to an injury last year and I wanted to ask his Dr if there was a diffrent med we could try for his depression and delusions of being in control of his life and telling me what to do. This has become a real problem in the last three weeks. It seems that he has that same condition my mom has where he doesnt think anything is wrong with him and mom and they can take care of themselves. So since we missed the appointment we went to Walmart to pick up a few things on the way back home we pass by there old home there is no other way to go so my dad insists  on stopping by there. Of course I dont want to because it always causes drama with mom but he didnt see it that way and started talking to me as if I were a child telling me we were going to go by there. Now I could have not stopped and kept going but I chose to ""pick my battles"" and didnt have the energy to argue. Im so tired.....so we go they check on things we leave. mom cries as usual dad was upset and as we are leaving tells me he and mom are going to move back home and there is nothing I can do about it...that he loves me and doesnt want to hurt me but this is the way it is going to be. So I said all this to ask what am I going to do? He has been saying this for 3 weeks now I thought he may forget but nope.I understand it must be so difficult for elderly people to move and add ALZ for the both of them on top of that and I dont know how to exactly handle this. My husbands way of doing things are matter of fact and not always nice sweet and gentle so his solution is tell them the way it is going to be and that I am in contol not them. They cant understand that reality and he knows this so I'm at a loss as to what to say or do. They of course are staying here with me. going back is not an option. Counciling wont work because they would not remember some one other than me telling them they have to live with me like a Dr that does not work either. They remember nothing but the fact that they want to go home that is the only constant memory. Mom has no hobbies dad likes to tinker with his truck but after a few minutes his back or chest begins to hurt him. He almost always walks with a cane now. and it is all just so sad. If my mom doesnt have something to clean or fold she lays on the her bed closses her eyes but she tells me shes not sleeping...sometimes she is but more than not she is just sad or mad cause she wants to go home. She is real good at slamming doors I hate this why did both of my parents have to get this awful condition? I know I am doing what God wants me to do because I have a peace about it sometimes though it seems so unfair and I am exhausted emotionaly. Yesterday we had planned to go out to their home to mow some grass and pack some more things in the car and dad didnt forget we were going to go do this. However he forgets everything else anyway when it something he wants to do he forgets that he is not in charge he cant drive he has no DL. Well very early he bangs on my bedroom door and yells at me to ""get up time is a wastin and we need to hit the road If I didnt hurry up he was going to leave me here!"" Sorry this is such a long post but the only people who understand are here on this board. Maybe I just needed to vent cause I dont see how I'm going to be able to get dad under control without hurting his feelings. Even if no one has any advice that is okay I feel better now that I have vented.

I know how can anyone tell for sure especially over the internet.  Which is why I haven't posted about it.  But I wonder if anyone else goes through this frustration.  My mom has had aphasia for awhile now communication was word salad for the last year but as she has slipped into stage 7 there is very little talking at all sometimes a word or two but usually it is something very simple like ""yeah"" in agreement or ""no no no"" when trying to change her (and even that is less and less).  She will be sound asleep on the couch in her favorite comfortable spot.  Fed warm with blankets feet in cushions everything I can do to assure her comfort.    She will wake up (or sometimes with eyes still closed) and sit up a little seems to struggle with frowning or wincing and sometimes hold or touch her forehead with her open palm sometimes leaving her hand over her eye or whole face.  She will often sigh or exhale like a ssss - pain?  sound.  She will often grab at the blankets on her lap or a pillow and sometimes grips them with a ferocious face.  Then she very often sits back or slumps a little and is SOUND asleep again!   She does these behaviors that I think could be either agitation or actual pain and no real way of knowing.  She WILL NOT answer me if it hurts no matter what I say how I word it how many times I repeat myself.  Even if I press on the areas she seems to maybe be grasping at usually her head or her knee/leg I don't get a wince or verbal anything.  Recently she had medication related dystonia and a strong sedated reaction to Tramadol.  She is off that and also off the Risperdal.  Now she is only on an anti-seizure med (grand mal seizure a week and a 1/2 ago) and Ativan.  If I increase the Ativan she still does the behaviors but sleeps harder and more often in between the waking agitated-like behaviors.   Advil doesn't seem to make much difference either way.   So I don't feel like anything is very conclusive.      Do I give her something stronger go back to the Tramadol?  I also have morphine and she is on hospice and they are saying do what I think is right... which I appreciate but I wish I knew.  I guess we don't know a lot of things at this stage / with this stupid disease???",False,*brightside*,2015-12-26,182.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541415,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom is physically declining so much. But she's also still more with it than others in her MC. DON/Director doesn't see the decline I do.  PCP visit last week shows high calcium in blood and I've chosen to find out why. Could be false reading could be parathyroid disease could be cancer. The reason I said ok to more blood and urine tests is to understand the future. I won't treat whatever is wrong. Mom is so tired all the time walking wears her out. She's entering stage 4 kidney disease and PCP recommended we see kidney specialist and consider dialysis. I said no. Mom reports no pain but makes frequent little ""whoo"" exhales when walking like she has just run a marathon for which ahead to trained enough. I know there is pain. MC doesn't see it.   PCP also suggested a higher dose statin to bring down LDL because of mom's vascular disease. I said no. I took PCP out into hallway and said ""ALZ is fatal. The Parkinson's is progressing. She's had 45 years of horrible hallucinations from schizophrenia. That's just 3 of the 7 chronic conditions you've found. I understand that your job is to make people as well as possible but death is not the enemy it's natural.""  PCP says she understands but really she doesn't have a clue what dementia is like for the patient or caregivers. Other than that I dearly love and am loyal to PCP. But it may be time to switch to the MC's visiting Dr and go on hospice. End stage kidney disease does not sound fun and someone needs to help manage the end.   I did not ask enough questions and am putting together a list for PCP and MC about how and when to start hospice. I have SUCH mixed feelings about all of this. I feel like I'm doing the right things one minute the next minute I feel like I'm playing God and trying to manage mom's death to coincide with when her money runs out.  I don't know if I just don't want to experience Stage 7 or if I don't want mom to go thru that.   Meanwhile I find mom's ""I'm fine!"" approach to life is hereditary. I'm fine for now I say but I'm not really. Up at 4:00 am every day because my brain starts up from the pressure of this a very stressful job and a deteriorating marriage because I'm the only breadwinner. My husband believes with all his heart that he's going to die within 4 years because no male on his dad's side of the family has lived to 65. There is nothing wrong with him except for bone spurs and a bad knee neither of which he will fix because ""there's no point."" Husband is on antidepressants so please don't suggest I help him get more help. I've tried I'm done with that. He's mostly a loving and funny man. It's not all bad it's just that nothing is the way I want it to be today so I'm having a little pity party.

It was pinned with surgery and the hope was that she would be able to stand on it in a few days although that took almost two weeks. She is still bedbound and cannot turn over by herself still moving that hurt leg only a few inches if at all.  She is weak and sleeps a lot unless she is agitated wanting to get up.  We have private CNAs or companions there at night in case she gets agitated trying to not make her more sedated.  Family and friends are there during the day.  We had problems with the staff at beginning and some family members complained.  Now it is almost worse. She has developed 3 bedsores one at hospital and two at rehab.  She is supposed to be repositioned every two hours but they are not doing it and when they change her some are causing her more pain than others.  I have been looking on You Tube and watching the ones who don't cause her pain and I see two different methods.  One uses the bedpads to roll her and the other method rolls people by pushing with one hand on hip and one on shoulder.  The bedpad method seems to cause her less pain.  Should I insist on it? Should I insist on her being turned every two hours?  They will answer the call bell almost immediately and turn it off and say they'll be back soon and it is often an hour before they come back if at all while I am there.  She does weigh almost 200 lbs and I understand sometimes they need two people but that is why she is in rehab!  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Apparently complaining to DON earlier got us absolutely nowhere.  They don't seem to like family or private staff there and seem to think that if they are there they should be helping with direct patient care.  Whatever anger they have at me or my family they seem to be taking it out by not caring properly for my mom and I am beginning to wonder if they have the skill and knowledge to do their jobs correctly let alone the attitude--Advice please?,False,towhee,2017-10-06,220.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147541413,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was hired to be a companion/aide. That is no longer the job as my mom has become immobile. She works largely without supervision. I don't live there; I am mainly there on weekends so I overlap with her but don't spend a lot of time with her. She was pleasant and friendly to me at the beginning; now she is cold and unpleasant. In particular if I give her feedback or instruction she takes great offense. My latest instructions have been along the lines of 'don't pour liquid soap directly on the skin' or 'don't forcibly bend Mom's legs in the Hoyer lift as it causes her to scream in agony.' (The former is a concern to be because of pH and skin integrity issues the latter was simply solved by me with a slight modification of how Mom was placed in the sling.)   There have been several instances of minor skin injuries; despite me telling her that she must report them to me (health care proxy) she does not do so consistently and instead tells my brother. I cannot oversee a plan of care if I do not know changes in my mom's status. We maintain a communication book; if you read it you would think Mom is speaking in full coherent sentences reading the newspaper daily and has completely intact skin. This is the same aide who last summer in collusion with my SIL pushed my mother three blocks in a wheelchair in the STREET to get her hair cut when I have a hairdresser who will come to the home.  At this point this aide is operating outside her scope of practice. I think she desperately wants the job and senses that I think that Mom would be better served in a facility so she is deliberately under-reporting. I do not think that this level of care can easily be done by one pair of hands--at least not without pain and fear and screaming for the patient. Quite frankly I feel that we have crossed the line into exploiting this aide. I have tried getting additional help; when my mom was on hospice they sent an aide for a few hours a day. Our aide refused to let the hospice aides  assist in care and used them as a cleaning lady.  I have raised these concerns to my siblings. Brother Useful is afraid of rocking the boat unless we have a firm plan in place to move Mom to a facility. Brother Invisible has no expressed opinion. Brother Pursestrings who has DPOA wants no part of a facility (they are expensive and he has an inheritance to think of). Although he may agree with me when I verbalized concerns about skin care reporting etc. he will not ever say anything to the aide. Consequently I am the bad guy and I think there is a cultural piece at play whereby I as a woman receive less respect and am accorded less authority then my male siblings. And of course there is the constant pressure from Invisible and Pursestrings that I should quit my job sell my home and move to be the full time caretaker.  If I say good morning this aide will not respond. If I give her direction she might verbally acquiesce but I think she does whatever she pleases when I am not there. There are many passive-aggressive slights like cleaning the bathroom with a very strong-smelling cleaner just as I put breakfast on the table for mom. I am afraid to say too much as I fear for repercussions and unkindness to my mom.  I don't know what happens when I am not there.

HOWEVER my mom has been walking weird since she was pushed down. At the initial appt with the surgeon for her arm when we determined it was broke so bad it needed replacing I wanted to take my mom in for her hips/knee to see if something was going on. I attributed her soreness to the fall. But as I watched her this last month something didn't ""feel"" right so I scheduled her for the hip doctor at the same time she had her shoulder follow up.  Well...to our surprise her left hip is broken pretty badly and not in a position that it appears to be healing properly.  Her right hip has severe arthritis that it most likely needs replacing.  So...until a CT scan she is ordered into a wheelchair for 1-3 months.  She goes back in a week to review her scan which I need to get scheduled in the next few days.  The doctor is alarmed and concerned that she has been walking around with her hip the way it is....proof that there is some disconnect with her pain receptor.  The same thing happened with her shoulder.

Emailing/calling the memory care center trying to get confirmation they would make everyone aware. The poor nurse at the hospital was so kind after my 20 minute vent about my frustrations when she said surgery would be canceled if my mom ate or drank anything. I said to the director of nursing in the memory care ""What am I supposed to do sit there all night and watch her?""  She ""kindly"" replied ""Well that's what some families do.""  uuugghhh.  So I went over took all her liquids and snacks away and put signs up all over her room-bathroom mirror inside of her exit door outside of the door. Spoke with the evening nurse who assured she would make sure the overnight staff knew and would check on her throughout the night. It was the best I could do. I'll deal with her missing key (3 days without her room key) and her missing remote later.  Tuesday-Surgery day. The nurse from the evening before was on staff and had my mom dressed and ready-I thanked her. Of course they had no packet for the hospital and the day nurse was nowhere to be found..whatever.  I left with mom in tow.  I managed to keep her calm most of the time. Unfortunately her surgery wasn't scheduled until noon so it was a lot of prep and time for her not to eat or drink (mostly). About 10 crying spells and she thought her arm had been broken multiple times on different occasions.  She kept telling me to leave and not fuss over her. Surgery went well and the block would keep her comfortable for 16-20 hours. I was unsure what would happen when it wore off since she expressed not much pain up to this point.  I finally left her to the hospital staff around 6:30pm.  Called a couple hours later to make sure she was resting comfortably.  Wednesday-Spent my lunch making calls to arrange for transitional care.and when I arrived at the all hell was breaking loose when I showed up at the hospital after work. I came around the corner towards her room and who was there arm out of sling and marching down the hall...my 96 lb mother. Top of her lungs point at me...""There's my daughter!  She is coming to take me out of this F-ing place!""  (on the good side she remembered me this time) oh boy......... The poor aide...eyes as wide as a doe's eyes.  The nurses came running from the nurse's station.  She was in severe pain and started crying.  Proof she isn't able to monitor what is pain and what isn't until it's over the top. She had told them not long before that she wasn't feeling any pain.  So...I got her arm back in the sling and sternly told her she needed to get back in to bed and I would make sure she was given something to ease her pain. Got her settled in a chair instead got some ice on it and we got her a shot of strong pain meds.  Within about 10 minutes she was feeling better. Talked to the nursing staff to arrange for her to alternate pain meds every 4 hours.  Explained that she isn't able to decide what is pain and what isn't until it's too late and they need to stay ahead of the pain.  They had her on 24 hour aid watch the rest of the night-someone was always in her room.  Feeding her was interesting because she thought her napkin was her grilled cheese.  Thursday-Called in the morning to see how she was doing...better and they were keeping ahead of the pain. Mood was up and down though. They suggested I be there for her therapy since she had refused some in the morning. Spoke with the PT and mom did most of her exercises except for the hanging pendulum-PT said they were concerned she would try to swing it so holding off on that. Spent a better part of the day with her. There was some talk of her going back to the memory care floor because she was ambulatory and they are concerned moving her will cause her to decline.  I put a quick stop to that and once I explained what I had been dealing with during all this time and she will still be in the same building she agreed that my mom should go to TCU.   Friday-discharge day.  I spent the morning on calls making sure she will get the level of care at the TCU that she deserves.  (It's the same facility)  They assured me she would be checked on about every hour get her therapy etc.  Time will tell. Took her to DQ before taking her to TCU.  A few glitches but got her settled and stayed a number of hours to make sure they were checking on her.  The repair guy for her call light knew her from her other floor...and we chatted a few minutes.   Saturday-called to check on her..no answer at the nurse's station. Frustrated..she has a phone in her room but doesn't know how to answer it.  So off I go..........

Then she was  released to  a SNF because she was so weak from being in bed 10 days in hospital. She caught a cold at the SNF and was readmitted to the hospital for almost three weeks while they did radiation for the tumors causing her pain. She was released Home last Thursday.   Since her initial hospital stay to now she has decompensated severely. She can no longer shower on her own needs assistance to walk/stand/get in and out of bed on her own.   Now she is refusing to eat and will not get out of bed.   My dad is 81 (but in shape like he is in his 40s spry and mentally sharp). They have been married almost 60 years and of course he is a bit codependent. He won’t make her eat or get out of bed.... he does not know what to do. He is very adamant she will remain at home with him due to the fact she deteriorated so quickly away from home.   Please let me know any suggestions you have on this situation.

He'd become less steady on his feet was less talkative and had developed a transient racing pulse. On Wednesday his breathing seemed rough and his heart rate high. The doctor ordered some blood work a chest xray and brought in an SLP for a swallow study on Thursday. I stopped by with some Chik-Fil-A as the SLP was offering him different kinds of foods and liquids. She was concerned that his swallowing was becoming impaired/sluggish and that she would suggest thickened liquids but a regular diet of whatever appealed to him for now. Dad was sitting in his chair and very tired but we had a nice visit. He enjoyed the chocolate shake I brought and ate half a chicken strip. We talked about family for a bit and I left him to have a nap with his C-pap/oxygen concentrator because he was tired from having spent 2 hours with the SLP and myself.  I stopped by to see the nurse on duty. She told me about the tests ordered by the doctor and that he would be bringing in an additional RN from home care to assess dad to see if there was anything more to do in terms of comfort/palliative care. I stopped by to update my mother about what they were doing for dad and went home. My mother called me at 11pm to tell me the memory care asked her to come right away. I knew this wasn't good; if he were alive we'd be driving to meet him at the ER. My worst fears were confirmed; dad had died in his sleep sometime between 10:30 and 11:00pm.   I am sad that he died alone but I am grateful he passed quietly and without the imposition of extreme medical interventions. I am grateful he was spared the pain of the end stages of this terrible disease and that he knew us to the end.   I want to thank the many posters on this site who helped me along this journey.

I went home (FL) at the end of January and Mom ended up in the hospital with weakness in her limbs.  She was diagnosed with cervical spinal stenosis.  A surgery was offered that would have been invasive and painful and I opted not to put her through it.  She was 84 and her Alzheimer's was moderate but the statistics were just not favorable enough for me to want to risk it.  She went to a SNF I came back to Washington my sister came to FL another stint in the hospital due to dehydration/UTI then a different SNF.  I went back to FL.  Mom begged and begged to go home and with the so-so level of care she was receiving coupled with the cost of almost 11K to keep her there my sister wanted to take on home care.  She and her husband moved back to FL to take care of her on Friday and we brought her home last Tuesday.   She was in a good deal of discomfort Wednesday night.  Everything hurt - every time she had to be repositioned or changed it was painful.  She had lost so much weight that it was a constant challenge to keep pressure sores from forming. Hospice came early Thursday morning and brought her to their inpatient unit so she could get appropriate pain relief (we didn't have any comfort meds at the house yet).  At the inpatient facility it was apparent that she had an ugly UTI and as she could no longer swallow pills the only other option was a painful intramuscular injection.  My sister and I told the nurse ""this is about her not about us.""  So she was made as comfortable as possible with morphine.  Even though she was pretty delirious we spent our last hours with her holding her hands praying singing and telling her everything we loved and would remember about her.  We thanked her for everything she had done for us asked forgiveness for our wrongs and let her know that we forgave her for anything she thought she had done wrong to us.  We told her that when she was ready to go it was okay and we would be okay even though we would miss her.  She left us at 11:05 PM.  The tears haven't come yet; I'm still waiting.  I cry over everything and am not sure why I'm not crying now.  But I know I will.  I am so very very grateful that we didn't leave things unsaid.  I don't know how much if any she comprehended but I choose to believe that she did based on the tears that flowed out of her eye and the fact that she was trying to talk.   You have been wonderful on this board and helped me prioritize administrative tasks that needed to be done.  In turn I have been able to help Mom in practical ways that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.  You have educated me about this awful disease and have opened your hearts about your struggles so that I would do some things differently than I might have otherwise.  Thank you thank you.  I can never repay your kindness and I pray for your comfort as you continue your journey with your loved ones.

Thank u for being there.    Its been 2 years now and i am super confused for my mil. Dont know whats going on .. how things will progress. Will it get worst. My husband has lost all hope. He doesnt even want to go to doctors. He thinks that a doctor shud be able to fix her completely. He is being unrealistic. My mil most of the time says things accurately like for example how to do things ..full of logic but she cannot carryout any of them.   Recently i have noticed tht her body generalized is swelling. Or maybe it cud be tht she is gaining weight. She cannot convey anything to is n in her head she is fine. She is always arrogant if we try to take care of her. Always angry. Always sad. Doesnt want to go anywhere. Doesnt want anyone to come to our place. But all day she is like i am bored take me somewhere or to somebody's house. And when we go .. in a minute she is like lets go back. Her depression is making me depress too. Our social life has been put to a hold. But my major concern is what does pwd feel themselves. Are they in pain? Does the confusion frustrate them? I try to understand this situation .. but being an emotional human it always affects me. The negativity n all. Its made me bitter too. Sometimes i argue with her. Try to knock some sense into her. I am sorry but sometimes i lose it. She is adamant that she can manage everything on her own but she cant. Do pwd dont ever realize their disease? I am sorry if i sound cruel.   Also i am worried about my 6 month old baby. She will grow up in such an environment. Always fights and bouts of anger. It would affect her personality and emotional well being. Can anybody give me tips on that.   Thanks in advance.

What to do about moms Teeth?,My mother's teeth are extremely brown and look awful .  We were told her decay is due to the years of medication she's taken. We have seen several Dentist.- One wanted to take all her teeth out he said they are all decayed. Another disagreed and said if you remove all her teeth with Alz she may not take to a set of Dentures. And will not understand to keep them in her mouth and most likely not be able to communicate where or how it is uncomfortable in order to make proper adjustments. The dentist further said that her own father had the same problem she decided to remove his teeth and she said it was a huge mistake because he would not use the dentures there fore could not eat as well and contributed to his dramatic weight loss and passing  We decided to leave in her teeth and take out the ones that we life threatening. We were going to replace with a partial and bridge. Well that all sounded great in a perfect world or for someone who was 50 or so. But for Mom she made it through extraction of 4 teeth. and then it took awhile for that to heal. And then the guilt set in for me and I didn't want her to go through that pain again. So I decided to let it be for awhile. I guess that was not such a good idea because she has lost one gold cap Molar one front bottom tooth just broke off and another piece of a tooth from somewhere. So Now we need to return to the dentist. It just makes my skin crawl. I realize that I am the one that is feeling the anxiety of it all. And I realize she has to go !! But I am apprehensive?

Meds seemed to be keeping her on an even keel.  This past Saturday she rolled out of her bed about 4:30 am and broke her shoulder. My niece and I got her to the ER and then home again.  The pain is really bad and the meds seemed to help.  After visit to the Orthopedic and fitted for a new brace surgery wasn't necessary due to the type of break thank Goodness.  However as of Wednesday this week she is not sleeping which means I don't sleep.  My niece works full time so days are just me and her. My sister helps when she can 2 or 3 times a week. All the others only visit on the weekend.  I know I need someone to come in at times during the week but never know until the night before if my Sister can come. That doesn't give any notice to the care givers and their schedules.  I never know if she's going to sleep or not and can't waste the money or their time. I'm responsible for getting her to her appts and getting her meds when they're ready so any down time I get is spent running or cleaning downstairs while my sister sits with her upstairs.  We're running on fumes here. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  She has no savings no long term care insurance only SS and Medicare along with Amerigroup for her medical.  The local nursing homes are $4000-$6000 a month. How do people in her position afford to be placed in a nursing home I feel it's getting close to making that decision.  She owns no property at all She lived in a condo I bought after loosing my husband 7 yrs ago her name is not on the property. I bought the car she drove but added her name to the title at the time because she would be driving it.  My name is also on the title. I have the local State Medicade office going to call me about her after submitting the paperwork in January on Monday or Tuesday. I really could use anyone's advice who's LO may have been in this same situation. I feel like I've got the national debt on my back and no financial help from any siblings.  Thank you and I apologize for this being such a long post.  Theresa,False,Theresa615,2018-01-12,7.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147540095,,,AlzConnected,,,
418,621047a67b65de9a5b65e94c,2147501102,2013-10-18 10:49:00,What every caregiver needs to know....,"This is a compilation of the advice from my previous thread.  I have eliminated the replies that did not relate directly to the subject.          Advice from Caregivers when asked “What have you learned from your journey that you think every caregiver should know?”        I have attempted to categorize their responses.    These are their words. Multiple statements in parentheses are further comments from subsequent responders.              Communication           I learned early in her dementia that logic and reason were no longer my friends.  She couldn't understand my reasoning and it only succeeded in frustrating both of us.         A caregiver must understand that their loved one cannot reason any longer. They cannot keep themselves safe make rational decisions and they cannot understand the word ""no"". You cannot argue with your loved one because it will only accomplish making your loved one angry and confused.         I learned the value of ""loving lies"". (“Learn to lie. It's good for their soul.”) (The best answer is the one that brings comfort and accomplishes the goals of keeping them as safe and well as possible.  It doesn't have to be the truth.)       Be prepared to answer the same question a million times. In fifteen minutes. Develop strategies for dealing with this because it WILL wear you down.     Learn to listen to what your loved one means not what they say. Very often their halting or mixed-up or confabulated words are actually trying to communicate something that is important to them. Don't take it lightly.    That said; don't take everything your loved one says  personally . They don't really hate you. They don't really think you are trying to steal everything. They don't really wish they were dead.      Remember they are doing the best they can.       Later on I learned that my mother was still present at all times although in a diminished way.  Just when I thought that I had lost all of her personality and that she was just a shell of the mother I had known her spirit would shine through in an instant to restore my faith and encourage me for the rest of my journey. (So important and I think most often overlooked.  I think this is because caregivers often don't slow down often enough to notice.) (I'd like to second the fact that our loved ones are still present even in stage 7.  We  can  reach them ... and if we try and are patient they can communicate with us.)           Philosophical           First and foremost non-professional caregivers need to understand that a person with AD has a terminal illness. They will never get better and will certainly get worse.          Second they need to prepare for many many years of caregiving whether in the home or in a facility. No one not even any of mom's docs expected her to live with AD as long as she has.         Take care of your loved one the way you would want to be taken care of and treated.          Realize that everyone's journey is different and what is right for someone else may not be right for you.    In other words if placement is the option that will work best for everyone there's no shame in that. If you have the time energy skills and desire to devote yourself to in-home caregiving then do so. But don't judge yourself by what others have done.            When you have a bad day with your loved one don't stew about it.       Had a bad day or a bad visit? This too shall pass.    Did you do your best today?    That's all anyone can ask.          Promise only that you will always love them and do your best to keep them comfortable and safe. Your love will always be there but promising to keep them in their own home or to always care for them cannot always happen. This disease often needs professionals in controlled settings to keep your loved one safe and comfortable.       The disease often takes ""happy"" away and the caregiver needs to realize that this cannot be on their ""to do"" list.        Our loved ones do not regress to childhood.  They simply have a greater tendency to pull up memories from an earlier time and to be unable tell that the memories are ""old"".  They are still adults with the memories of adults and should be treated with the respect and consideration due to adults.  They still do have recent memories.  And the more an event carries strong emotions -- of joy of fear of sorrow -- the more likely our loved ones will retain the memory of it.     You will need to step into a parental role far sooner than you realize; intentions to ""respect"" your parents’ old role and decision making puts them at risk.       I feel I have learned to live in the moment...and not take one day for granted.      And at the end of the day when you are stressed out and exhausted say a prayer for those Alzheimer patients in facilities that have nobody that visits or cares.  It will make you grateful that you are who you are - one that cares.           Practical          Take the time to find an AMAZING Certified Elder Law Attorney (CELA) and a primary care geriatrician.  We must delegate and pay for professional expertise for the well-being of our ALZ loved ones.         We are nearing the end of our journey with this disease and the one thing I would add looking back is don't be afraid to jump in and take charge of the situation early.  It’s hard and we want to be mindful of our loved ones feelings but when it comes to financial matters wills POA's etc.(and even living arrangements) you simply have to take charge.  It may be rough in the moment but you will save yourself so much worry and grief down the road.         Start gathering information on resources and help before you actually need it.           Get a notebook; it can be a small steno notebook.  Keep it with you at all times and right down names phone numbers of EVERYONE you speak with the agency or group they are with.  Take it to all medical appointments and note date doc's name take notes of what s/he says.  Doctors dentist specialists ALL of it. Need a repair to an appliance in the home (whether loved one's home or yours if loved one lives with you) put all the info in the notebook.  This book will become your chronological list of everything that happens and you will find it highly valuable when you need to go back and call someone to ask them about . . . whatever.          Monitor your loved one closely watch for things they are having difficulty with and make modifications where you can i.e. difficulty with eating or remembering to eat dressing hygiene driving handling finances difficulty with walking using the phone.   Looking around their environment and making safety modifications for them.         By far the most serious danger posed in the earlier stages of the Alzheimer's disease is when the individual may decide they want to go for a walk go searching for ""home"" or maybe just walk outside to get the paper. In a restaurant they may go to a rest-room. When they turn around the place they expect to see is gone and they find themselves standing helplessly confused what they see is totally unfamiliar to them. Get to know your local police. Take them a picture of your loved one explain his/her dementia. Even if they have a Safe Return bracelet if your local police are aware of the issue they are better prepared.       When visiting your local police ask if you can add your loved one's dementia to your 9-1-1 record in case something happens to YOU.       Be persistent and proactive in dealing with medical professionals care facilities anyone and any place that is providing care to your loved one.  If you are not satisfied with the care say something and insist on getting answers and getting concerns resolved.  Don't be afraid to ask questions don't be afraid or hesitant to ask for something you want done for your loved one.  Go with your loved ones to doctor appointments always.  If you have concerns regarding your loved ones fax or email the health professional a written list of your concerns days before the appointment this helps give the health professional a heads-up saves you from having to bring up sensitive issues in front of your loved one.       Get your loved one started in Adult Daycare while they are still ""with it"" enough to appreciate it. If you wait too long the sensory stimulation will overload them. (This was a big mistake I made.)     Be very careful about Board &amp; Care facilities aka Adult Foster Homes. They usually cannot provide the medical care your loved one will need and they are not held to the same standards as nursing homes or SNFs.     Support your loved one with memory crutches in the early and mid-stages. Label things write down phone numbers and leave in multiple places. Assist with meds.    Recognize that in later phases those crutches will be useless. Avoid insisting that your loved one recognize the crutch; realize that they haven't got a clue what the crutch is supposed to mean.       Leave out plenty of paper and pens in your loved one’s room. You never know what sweet notes you will find once they have died. You will find that they probably have tried to create their own crutches and those self-made crutches will move you to tears when they are no longer around.           Financial           Get a file cabinet / drawer ready and buy a box of file folders.  The amount of paperwork that comes with loved one (unless you are dealing with Early Onset then I don't know about that) is astounding.  Medicare Social Security Pension bank statements credit accounts VA benefits statements reports from the lab DMV notices for license motor vehicle tax if loved one has own home all the things that go with a house real estate taxes home owners insurance electric and phone bills cable bill the paper alone will overwhelm you!!  And as time goes on for Caregivers to come in while you go out for a once every 3 months night out for Rehab stays for ER visits ambulance rides hospital stays.        Be very very very careful and watch for Medicare fraud. Read all those statements you receive as dull and boring as they may be!            Support           Join a support group.         Find a Caregiver Support Group near you and GO every meeting.         Remember to take care of yourselves as well in the process.         Do not be ashamed or hesitant to ask for help.  And again gather as much help as you can get in caring for your loved one whether it's family friends or hired.       Seek information and support during all stages of caregiving.     Try your best to cultivate good relationships with family and hold them close. Do all you can to engage them in the care of your loved one.    That said be prepared to lose siblings and other ""close"" family members over this awful disease.     I've learned and I think all caregivers should learn that you shouldn't count on family for help especially other siblings. Even if they say they will help remember that they won't. Always rely on yourself to make the decisions because nobody else will do it.     Also a lot of friends and family will become scarce. You will hardly ever see anybody for a visit and when they do visit it will be very short. It's kind of a lonely process.     Lean heavily on the Alzconnected.org forum for advice counsel and a shoulder to cry on. And yet don't rely solely on this forum. Caregivers tend to become too isolated and we all need real humans for real hugs and real shoulders to cry on.          Medical         Make a list of all the medications your loved one is taking the dosages when they take it and the prescription number and carry that list with you at all times.  You never know when you need to call for an ambulance or meet your loved one at the ER this list comes in handy and the emergency personnel always appreciate it.       Prepare a Go-Bag for the days you have to take your loved one to the ER. In addition to a book for you to read make sure you have the following: Current list of meds and fifteen million jillion copies of the AHCD DPOA and the (red or hot pink) POLST. No matter how many times you give these documents to a hospital they will ignore them or lose them or forget to consult them.     Never assume that any new symptom is ""just"" due to the dementia.  It could be due to a medicine (either an acute or a chronic side effect) drug interactions an infection dehydration an injury undiagnosed and/or under-treated pain sensory deprivation sensory overload etc.  When in doubt talk to the doctor.     Hundreds of different factors can cause symptoms that mimic Alzheimer's.  Most of them can be treated if caught soon enough.  It is essential to have our loved ones thoroughly evaluated by a knowledgeable team of doctors.  Don't assume it's Alzheimer's just because someone is older and/or close relatives were diagnosed with AD.     Keep a journal of symptoms of treatments (prescription and OTC drugs natural supplements etc) and of anything that could affect symptoms especially anything that can cause stress.  Symptoms and behaviors are affected by all sorts of different factors and the only way to tell whether e.g. a new drug is helping or causing a side effect is by keeping daily track of what's going on in our loved ones' lives.     Many doctors are unfamiliar with the disorders that cause dementia don't know how to diagnose them don't know how to treat them ... and often don't like working with dementia patients which is understandable because there is so little that can be done for them.  Caregivers need to keep searching until they find qualified doctors who want to work with and are capable of helping their loved ones.     Buy a Physician's Desk Reference and learn what the meds do that your doctor prescribes. Don't be shy about challenging them on meds that are too dangerous or ineffective.     Watch for    UTIs. If you live a good distance from a hospital buy the self-test strips (Target carries them). Any sudden change in behavior test for a UTI.          Planning       Even if you plan to keep your loved one at home for as long as possible start researching nursing homes Skilled Nursing Facilities and assisted living facilities *now*. The wait list for the good ones can be two years long.     Make sure to make arrangements for some kind of outside help as soon as you can such as respite care or something similar. You may think you can do it alone but I'm here to say that nobody can do it all by themselves. You will need someone else reliable to step in for you and it certainly won't be family.     If your loved one relies on Medicaid other state equivalents meet with someone (e.g. Area Council on Aging) who can explain the ins and outs of the system thoroughly especially your rights. Many hospitals and nursing homes ignore patients' rights unless you are armed with knowledge.       Anticipate the needs of your loved one and put a plan together to meet those needs.       Understand that no matter how well-prepared you are for this disease you will hit the inevitable brick wall where all your preparedness means absolutely positively nothing. What works today is guaranteed not to work tomorrow.       Plan but try and put your energy into ""Now.""  Things can change on a dime and your journey can be anywhere from a few months to decades.              Education         It is never too early to gather information on adult daycare centers different types of care facilities caregiving agencies etc. advance directives power of attorney eldercare attorneys VA benefits.       I second the idea of gathering as much information as you can as soon as you can!!! For many of us we may not be the primary caregiver from the beginning. In our case my FIL took care of MIL and really hid as much as he could from everyone so when he got sick and all of a sudden DH and I were thrown into caring for both we had to get a very crash course indeed!!! Also make sure your loved one has their Will in order including a living Will so you know their wishes. Also we were not able to find out exactly my MIL's wishes for funeral burial etc.    So we are doing the best we know how.  If you can have a conversation about this while your loved one is still able it takes pressure off worrying if you are doing right by them.     Learn all you can about the specific form of dementia your loved one has. Each type requires a unique strategy tweaked to unique progression.            Emotional        Try not to feel guilty.    When your loved one loses independence or abilities it is not YOUR fault -- it is the disease's fault. You're trying to do your best to help keep that person safe and they may not always like it. But they are past the point of understanding/comprehending your true intentions.     If your loved one relies on Medicaid etc. be prepared for denigrating statements directed at you the caregiver or your loved one about lack of preparedness laziness blah blah blah. Develop a thick skin and anticipate this lack of caring. Those people are not worth the time of day.     Be prepared for disappointments in your circle of friends people who say they will help who never do. One negative/positive aspect of being a caregiver for someone with dementia: You learn who your true friends are (and it isn't always the people you'd expect).     Be careful not to antagonize your immediate family (spouse children grandchildren) over care of your loved one. While your loved one's needs are important the needs of the not-terminal living trump their needs.     Prepare yourself for the long haul. This is not a short terminal disease twelve months and funeral. It can be painfully excruciatingly long.    That said if you are NOT prepared for this disease you will lose your mind.     Grow a backbone. (This is intended for those who are prone to accept everything a professional says whether it’s a doctor nurse or professional caregiver.    Only you know your loved one intimately and you have to be the best advocate for them possible.    This requires finding a new strength within yourself.)            End-of-life Decisions             For a dementia patient quality of life can be far more important than quantity of life.  Our loved ones can go on palliative care whenever they or we feel it is time to focus on quality of life.              Self-Care             The Primary Caregiver should not devote so much of their own time and energy to the demented patient that the Caregiver wakes up one day to realize that they have no life of their own.    For a Caregiver to give up their life in order to offer care and loyalty to the demented patient is destroying two people at once. The patient will progress in dementia anyway no matter.    The Caregiver should reserve part of their private life for their own tasks and savors.    [ And by the way I am most guilty of the latter by offering so much of my being to my wife's Dementia that I gave my life away only to realize my mistake in my 8th year of Caregiving then taking two years to retrieve even part of the life I had destroyed.]                Try and pace yourself as best you can it's a long journey and by pacing I mean using as many resources as possible that you can find to help care for your loved one.         Take good care of yourself. You're no good to your loved one if they outlive you.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------           Trust your gut!  If you’re asking yourself “Is it time…?”         …to take away the car keys         …to get more help         …to move loved one to memory care     It probably  IS  time.     We tend to put off making these important decisions too long.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------           In addition to all these great comments here is a wonderful list from a very experienced nurse that went through the dementia journey with her mother and then again with her step-dad.    I feel I need to include it in its entirety as it contains so many relevant subjects.          1.  Try to remember if your Loved One is driving you to absolute distraction; imagine what it must be like to live inside their heads FEELING all that agitation upset and fury and believing all those horrible delusions (rigid false beliefs) as truth.  It is a hellish existence for them and unconscionable to let it continue when there is help to be had.  Getting a dementia expert early in the course of the disease is a necessity on several fronts.     2.  Always have a ""Plan B;"" that is a well-researched and well thought out plan of what you will do IF something unforeseen abruptly happens.  This can happen and does happen.  So; if you have researched local assisted living facilities as well as local nursing homes and Care Agencies prior to need then if the abrupt unforeseen event arises physical or dementia you will be prepared and not have to run hither and thither under tremendous pressure and time constraints.  It will also help you to know the quality of such facilities and that will benefit your loved one.     3.  The person with dementia is MORE than their dementia.  They just like us have multiple body systems.  They just like us will develop illnesses and conditions totally unconnected to their dementia.  Always honor this and ensure that the loved one is screened for other conditions outside the dementia when they begin to exhibit symptoms.  Do not ascribe or permit doctors to ascribe all changes and symptoms to dementia alone.     4.  When our loved ones have delusions and confabulate making up so many stories; it can be exhausting and a bit unnerving; BUT always err on the side of caution and check things out that they tell you because there will be times when what they are saying is not a delusion but actual truth.  Respect this and do your due diligence and check things out.  I learned this the hard way.     5.  If your loved one is alert and their friends (and even relatives) no longer call or send cards; buy a stack of ""thinking of you"" cards and mail a couple now and then and sign someone else's name to it.  On birthdays send six or eight birthday cards sent from other friends or relatives (who you know will not do this) and you will find your loved one so delighted and happy.  If in the nursing home put the cards on the bulletin board or tape them to the closet door so your loved one can see the bright colors and if capable of doing it can show others what they have.     6.  Try to remember that if your loved one who verbally abuses you was in her/his ""right mind"" they would be horrified to see how they were behaving and that they do love you; so try and forgive the dread behaviors and verbal abuse they may demonstrate toward you now that their brains are ""broken"" and severely compromised.  They cannot help what they do.     7.  Therapeutic fibs (fiblets) are indeed ethical.  They are an honorable and respected tool in the caregiver's tool box.  Using such fiblets is an actual kindness that permits us to provide care get them to medical care dispense medication and get things done without causing them to have meltdowns upset and agitation.       8.  ALWAYS go the doctor's office and into the exam room with your loved one; they will be poor historians minimize their conditions and never accurately report what the doctor said.  In order not to have to talk about your loved one in front of them about their behaviors you can write a detailed memo outlining changes and concerns and either fax it to the doctor a couple days prior to the appointment or bring it with you and have staff give it to the doctor and ask him/her to read it BEFORE he/she goes into the exam room.     9.  And as others here have said get those DPOAs for Healthcare and for Finance.  Get a HIPAA Waiver signed so the doctor can share medical information with you and most of all; get your name on all your loved ones bank and financial accounts.  This will save you from severe problems as the disease moves forward.  Banks do not always honor the Financial DPOA and it is best to get this done as early as possible.  You will then be a co-owner on the account and an make adjustments etc. as the need arises without hours of difficulty.      10.  Get organized with files.  Make new files for each calendar year.  File ALL loved one related receipts bills etc. that you have paid.  Make a file for each item or category that you paid on behalf of your loved one including household items doctors hospital ambulance nursing home medications etc.  Then each and every month use the checkbook register and bank statements to put together a Financial Accounting Report.  You will be able to then find everything at a moment's notice and if you are ever questioned you will have the files and reports to back yourself up.  I also sent a copy of each month's Financial Accounting Report to each adult sibling to keep everything transparent and for them to see the cost of living items.     1l. Learn to stand up to doctors and other healthcare professionals when they are either inappropriate or non-caring ignoring or shirking.  They are just people and if you feel their services are not in-line with your loved ones symptoms or needs speak up . . . you are now the advocate and the voice of your loved one who can no longer speak for themselves.     12.  If your loved one is developing a fixation on wearing certain clothing items catch on early and from then on buy two of everything.  That way you can sneak the dirty garment for the wash and leave the second clean matching garment.  This will avoid many meltdowns in such a situation.  AND do buy a spare pair of eyeglasses to keep on hand.  I found this valuable as glasses get lost in the hospital and in the nursing homes.  Better safe than sorry on that front.     13.  Learn early that it costs you absolutely nothing to bite your tongue and agree with your loved one or not challenge your loved one no matter how wrong they are about something.  Learn to never ever argue never to try and explain their incorrectness you cannot educate . . . just validate their FEELINGS and not their words and then refocus them . . . you will both be better for it.     14.  When there is a sudden moment of clearing of dementia or a sudden loving moment or a moment of re-connection; take this as a gift because it IS a gift.     15.  Incontinence is the primary reason most loved ones are placed in a facility.  Try to get a handle on this issue early and set up the incontinence supplies do the every two hours in the bathroom training and getting things set up to deal with this as easily as possible and it will benefit both of you.     16.  Remember that medications can act alone or in concert with another to cause problems both physical or psychological.  This can happen when first starting a drug or can happen after taking the drug for a long while.  Drugs need to be screened by the doctors each visit and at each problem.  Acquaint yourself with each and every prescription and all side effects by going to a valid site like    www.rxlist.com    and reading the side effects.       17.  If your loved one suddenly has profound behavioral issues and heightened irritability and even agitation you may want to have her/him checked for a ""silent"" urinary tract infection.  These UTIs are called ""silent"" because they have no physical symptoms; what often happens is a sudden ramping up of profoundly negative behaviors and they are really problematic.  Once the infection is treated the person usually returns to baseline function.  This is a frequent issue for many caregivers loved ones and in some happens often.     18.  Take care of yourself.  Develop a relationship with a ""companion"" person or aide who can come in either routinely or when you call so you can get some breaks for yourself.  This is a necessity and will serve you well.     19.  Keep a log on the computer or in writing.  It is astonishing how often we must remember things that happened outcomes of doctor's visits onset of change in condition or behavioral issues etc. and having a dated log will really help.  This is another one of those things I learned to do the hard way.     On financial:          When conducting financial business for your loved one NEVEREVER co-mingle you checking and savings with theirs.  Your loved one should have their own checking and savings etc. and you can be co-owner on it; but you should never put their money in your account or yours in theirs.     Also try not to use a credit card but if you must such a for mail order prescriptions or online purchase of incontinent supplies try and use your parent's credit card and never ever use it for your own personal use.  Be sure and keep the credit card statements in that file system we have discussed.     If you co-mingle funds and then you are being questioned you will not be able to easily demonstrate or defend what you have been doing.     Oh yes; though it sounds rather odd do run a credit check on your loved one at all three credit bureaus.  I was amazed to find out my mother had SIXTEEN credit accounts open plus some errors on the report.     You can ""freeze"" the accounts for a small fee in that no one can go in and open an account etc.; so that is a good thing to do.     Also when I closed the accounts I was told by each account company that I would need to send a full copy of my DPOA for Finance to each one of them and it would take two months or so to completely process the account - SO; what I did was to call the accounts back at  a later time and used my mother's name and said I wanted to close the accounts . . . . of course I had her social security number her mother's maiden name and the account number and they closed the accounts right on the spot; no fuss no muss.     I also requested of the bank and ALL account companies - Mom's credit card as well as the accounts I was closing NOT to send any applications for future accounts nor any advertising whatsoever.  To my surprise this was honored.",False,dj okay,2011-11-29,1840.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501102,,,AlzConnected,,,

My poor mom couldn't handle it at home anymore which I get however it was very traumatizing knowing he would be living in this home now and I would never see him at his own house again.  It's been a little over a year and I still cry when I leave after visiting.  I sometimes cry while I'm visiting.  When they have to do something to him that makes him yell in pain.....you guessed it I cry like an absolute baby.  This is affecting my entire existence.  My job has suffered due to lack of concentration and the fact that I just don't have it in me to even care.  I feel guilt sadness for him just the unfairness of it all the fact that he didn't deserve this right after retirement.....the list goes on and on. I see no end in sight.  On one hand I don't want to lose him on the other hand I want him to pass peacefully at night and have this nightmare end.  He can still interact and can have a few joyful moments but he can't feed himself he can't use the bathroom he can't do anything at all for himself and I know he would be mortified if he really knew.  I just want to know if anyone has any advice for me.  I don't have any friends in this situation.  I can hardly enjoy MY life while knowing he is there in this situation.  It's all too much.  Thanks for any input.,False,beachbumterri,2018-02-20,4.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539545,,,AlzConnected,,,

She peers back up somewhat and is on hospice.  She takes her namenda gabapentin for neuropathy reglan  and can have 1/2 hydrocodone as needed for pain but she MAYBE only takes 1/2 a few times a week.  They also prescribed liquid lorazepam because she seemed so anxious.  My questions are about her behavior versus meds.  She is in a new normal that I can’t figure out if it’s the advancing cancer advancing AD or new meds.  Last week she was making all kinds of noise during the night in her room and one night came to me and told me she was cold and cold air was coming out of the vents. So I took care of that and got her settled.  Next morning I asked if she was warm enough and she proceeded to tell me the last two nights there was an evil spirit in her room beating her all night and if I should try spending the night in that room and I needed to get a priest over.  I tried to go along yet say calming things about how we did have our house blessed and things like that. She never mentioned it again but I hear her banging around in her room many nights.  She has lined books up on the vents to cover them opens and closes the closet doors wets the bed often looks through her old pictures that are in the closet.  During the days she says she is “under the weather” or feels “ so-so”.  Doesn’t always want to dress and has lost about 12 pounds since January.  She isn’t eating well.  The hospice nurse says this is just a slow decline and a natural progression given AD and cancer and just being 89.  But so many of these symptoms are new that I just want to see if anyone thinks it could be the reglan or the lorazepam bc those are new meds.  She can have .25mls (which is very small dose I am told) of lorazepam but I give her a little less bc I am worried about it.  Any thoughts?,False,sml615,2014-05-15,145.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539575,,,AlzConnected,,,

I began caring for my grandma 12 hours a day after she fell and caused her dementia to worsen. I have many questions but will just address 1 now. She is in horrible pain. In her side. She holds it. She moans in her sleep. She only gets tramadol and tylenol. She has stopped eating. Shes active and alert but will not take food. Some days she sleeps all day and so weak i can barely get her up on her potty chair. She even tells me she hurts and how shes gonna have to go doctor. But when she goes she says nothings wrong. And i watched in amazement this past week when home heath came for the 1st time. They called 15 mins before they came. She had been sleeping all morning with heating pad on side. Immediately she has me change her clothes brush her hair get the house perfect. She gets up on her walker and goes n greets them. As they do the exam she is lying left to right denying any pain illness etc. And when i tell them the truth she gets very smart mouth and says i dont know what im talking about. She is all animated. All laughing getting up and down doing stuff to appear ok....then they leave...and the minute they are gone she collapses in her chair in pain crying an exhausted then sleeps 3 or 4 hours. I dont understand it. I even told her once i was gonna tell them about pain and she said if i did i was on her s$%t list. Im at a loss. I have other questions too but would appreciate anyones feedback on this.

LO is stage 7D.  Barely eats cannot feed herself  pockets food on pureed diet has lost significant weight leans to one side non ambulatory cannot initiate speech may say a word or two a few times a day if prompted sleeps the majority of the day and is on hospice.  Let's be blunt she probably has months to live and is uncomfortable due to rigidity most of the time we see her.      Here's what the staff at MC tells us.  She's so happy and smiling all the time.  She is up and going to meals 3x a day.  Do we want to sign her up for spa services at the salon?  She's been watching the birds in the aviary.  She's watching TV.   Maybe she needs some tylenol to help her pain levels (why only tylenol?). Happy happy cheerful about how awesome she is.       No. No. No.  She does none of this.  She is either asleep in bed or in her wheelchair all day long.  She falls asleep eating and her head is resting on the table.  If she is parked in her chair in front of the aviary or TV she is sound asleep.  She is in pain when transferred visibly wincing  so why are we worried about getting her to the 'spa'?  If I drop by she is always asleep and it doesn't matter where she is in the building.  I've sat through meals with her and she eats on reflex if she is even awake enough to do so.   They seem behind on recognizing she is in pain unless I'm there demanding they do something and showing them some of her pain signals.  They want to keep upping her food and ensure intake.  We want comfort care and the ability for her to pass peacefully.  That's what her medical directive tells us to do.      I feel like their happy bubbly talk about how she's doing is hampering their ability to provide prompt comfort care.  It's taking days to get pain addressed.  I feel like their happy bubbly talk about her is invalidating what we see and know and that is she is end stage of a terminal illness.  I want her in bed more to sleep - I understand repositioning - but how comfortable can she be flopped over in a wheelchair when she could be in bed?  It's painful for me to talk to some of them who are bubbling over with joy about how fabulous a day she's having when we are mourning her losses and preparing for the end.  How do I communicate that to the staff in the meeting?  Do I need to do it or do we let them function in an alternate universe?,False,rosepoint,2014-01-22,573.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539573,,,AlzConnected,,,
423,621048297b65de9a5b65ecad,2147539639,2018-02-25 10:50:00,Improvements in Alzheimer's disease,"Years ago when I posted information about aromatherapy on these boards a number of people tried it with varying degrees of results: from increased alertness and awareness of place to increased restiveness and anxiety (which some essential oil can cause in some people).  Since then there have been generally two responses: stop making me feel guilty for not trying this (which is a very valid response) to stop giving me false hope with all this hocus pocus (which is a somewhat biased response).  Nevertheless I continue to occasionally post on treatments for Alzheimer's disease for those who might be interested.  I will repost this one here:    There is a series of video and written evidence showing improvements with certain treatments in Alzheimer's disease.  These improvements include the ability to communicate more clearly a significant decrease in agitation and delusion an ability to recognize surroundings and feel comfortable around people who were once more familiar.  Short-term memory may not improve much and a person is not always ""lucid"".  To put it another way Alzheimer's disease can be treated but not cured.    CBD oil    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb6g5-A1ljA       Dronabinol (synthetic THC)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v lRnKmufRZc    www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWL0aFuUl6U       Her memory is shot. Although the progression of loss almost stopped. She is pretty much where she was 3 years ago. She thinks I'm Joel about 5% of the time my Dad 50% and no idea the rest of the time.       Medical marijuana makes Alzheimer's manageable. If we had a larger family this would be a breeze it's just me and the girlfriend. I am 100% certain my mother would be long dead without THC medical marijuana. At the very best she would have been in a home I was at the very end of my rope 3 years ago. She tried all the traditional medications that did nothing or made CRAZY worse. My only regret and it's a darn* strong one is not knowing about it earlier. If she would have started this much earlier I believe she would still be independent.     Aromatherapy         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKN3DGxl06o    Ecumen's Awakenings program involves the replacing of coma-inducing psychotrophic drugs with exercise aromatherapy and good-old fashioned get-to-know the patient. Minneapolis NBC affliate KARE 11 News featured one of Ecumen's communitues North Branch in this great story.    Also from Ecumen:    ""Clearing the Fog""    The woman who was in her 90s had lived for several years at the Ecumen Sunrise nursing home in Two Harbors Minn. where the staff had grown accustomed to her grimaces and wordless cries. She took a potent cocktail of three psychotropic drugs: Ativan for anxiety and the antipsychotic Risperdal to calm her plus an antidepressant. In all the time she’d lived at Sunrise she hadn’t spoken. It wasn’t clear whether she could recognize her children when they came to visit...    Nevertheless Ecumen’s Awakenings project emphasizes nondrug responses. “Medications have a place but that shouldn’t be the first thing you try” said Eva Lanigan director of nursing at the Two Harbors facility...   So the home trained its entire staff (housekeepers cooks dining room servers everyone) in a variety of tools to calm and reassure its 55 residents: exercise activities music massage aromatherapy. It taught people the kind of conversation known as “redirecting” — listening to elders and responding to them without insisting on facts that those with dementia can’t absorb or won’t recall...  But with reduced medications the woman at the Two Harbors home did seem to awaken. She was able to speak — haltingly and not always understandably but enough to communicate. And what she let Ms. Lanigan know after years of being virtually nonverbal was that she was suffering physical pain the cause of her crying out.   ""Maggie: A case study in dementia""    Clues For Making Maggie Happier   To try to make bathing more pleasant staff decided to heat the bathroom before taking her in and dry her off with towels fresh from the dryer. They also installed a rolling shade over the sink mirror as Maggie appeared to be fearful when she saw the person in the mirror.    Another strategy they tried was intensive aromatherapy. Caregivers rubbed the essential oil of lavender on her skin every two hours to surround her in a familiar and comforting scent...    A couple of weeks passed and gradually Maggie became calmer and more at ease.    Their efforts were so successful that Maggie was able to go entirely off the lethargy-inducing Ativan she had been taking three times a day. She doesn’t even need it PRN (as needed) anymore. Staff even discover to their delight glimpses of joy in Maggie’s eyes.  ..   And it never stops being hard work; Maggie doesn’t have a perfect day every day. She just has hard days much less frequently and she has moments of joy now where before everything was psychic pain and fear and confusion. English Rose caregivers have learned that striving for excellence must become a way of life not a plateau to achieve and then rest.    ""ECU therapist studies link between scent and memory""    The study enables Loy to look at how appetite and moods are affected by the scents. To stimulate appetite a scent mixture of grapefruit and clove is sprayed on patients’ bibs before mealtime. A scent mixture of grapefruit and frankincense is used to help curb the so-called Sundown symptoms such as anger and sadness that often occur during the early evenings.  .. “It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately it’s like she has been reborn” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”       ""Rosemary for Alzheimer's treatment""     My mother is in the final stages of Alzheimer's and was given a rough estimate of only 6 more months of life back in November. As is very common her condition can change from day to day but still in a general direction for the worse. She reached the point where if she was even awake at all she couldn't communicate anymore and hardly showed the sign of being aware of my presence. I've been using alternative medicine for a few years now to treat my depression anxiety and also for general health. I've since discovered the overlooked value of the herb Rosemary and now use it to treat the symptoms of my depression. I've also noticed better clarity of thought along with an improved short term memory. I was able to get the doctor's permission to give this herb to my mother and we figured at least it couldn't hurt. Much to my surprise there's been a noticable change. There have been quite a few day now where my mom has been more focused and alert than she's been in a long time. I even got some news from one of her nurses who said my mother had a brief conversation with her. Its been at least a year or two since I can remember anything like that. This change has also been noticed by others on the nursing staff as well as her doctor who is very surprised. Now I'm not suggesting this is any kind of a ""cure"" for Alzheimer's but the improvement in my mother's condition is something to be said about Rosemary and it's given me some more quality time with her that I thought had been thing of the past.........Gary          At present Alzheimer's disease cannot be cured.  But can it be treated?  Absolutely!",False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539639,,,AlzConnected,,,

Theislanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomedus all because it was raining and cold.      In mymind rain is both a curse and a blessing. In fact scripture bearsthis out by showing that God has used rain to flood the earth andalso has withheld it causing a drought. Me ? I reallydon't much carefor it. I don't like wearing a coat so if it's raining I usuallyget wet. That coupled with the fact that it's almost always on thecool side when it rains here means that I will not only get wet butI will be cold.  When I moved from California to Oregon I was atfirst delighted with the weather here. I reveled in the changes thatcame with the seasons. Until I had to work in the cold. Put me in anice day with temperatures just above freezing add rain and Iguarantee I will be  cold . Even with a coat or two.  I'mguessing that Paul didn't like the cold and wet much either and itwould appear that he was more than a little surprised at the welcomehe and his party were shown when they landed on the island of Malta.Fact is the islanders didn't speak the languages Paul knew and hedidn't speak theirs. But they all understood wet and cold.   Ascaregivers we don't understand the language of a PWD even if theystill use words we know because it all seldom makes much sense tous. I see that every day here with Barbara. Only a few hours ago Iput on a movie I had gotten for her and she said  "" No no. Ithink I've seen that one. "" So I fell back on her favorite ""A Touch of Frost "" and older British crime drama. Part of thereason I could be reasonably sure she would like it is because she  always  likes it. Every time I get out the set of DVD'scontaining the entire 42 episodes which I calculate at approximately 61.25 total hours she will love every minute. And this in spite ofher having seen them all at least 4 times in the past 2 years. Forher Inspector Jack Frost is a warm fire on a cold and rainy night.   It's atrick sometimes finding the thing that will help our loved ones becontent and many times it's a pain pure and simple. But it isimportant. Their happiness often is dependent on how we react totheir needs. And we know those needs vary wildly at times.   Being acaregiver is both a curse and a blessing. We can treat it as acurse and it will never be anything but a curse. Or we can thankGod for allowing us to be His hands in this situation and allow Himto bless us for doing what we do. There's no promise that we will berewarded here on earth but there is a crown of life for those who doHis bidding.   FatherGod I pray that we will be open to Your Spirit. Open in a way thatlets us help our loved ones with humility and patience knowing thatif we were afflicted we would also want loving care. Thank You forallowing us to do this.

We are expecting a hospice evaluation today.  We have been told due to the rate of decline that it may only be a month or so before passing.  Shock for us but relief that there may not be a long period of lingering in stage 7.  Waiting for hospice to call before we notify the rest of the family.     I've never heard of someone going through late stage 6 - stage 7 so quickly.  Lost all walking ability in days.  Went from carrying on conversations to single word responses in 4 weeks.    Totally skipped eating finger food.  Could manipulate utensils - as long as food was cut up - a month ago today can't even manage finger food so hand feeding all meals.  We have tried PT OT and speech therapy initially thinking it was a slight downturn due to a back issue but we are discontinuing all therapy this week.  Spends days staring off into space or sleeping.  Can only hold attention for a brief second but shows no recognition of family any longer.  Still smiles when anyone says hello.    Next Monday we are making pre-paid funeral arrangements as we've been advised to do.  Sad for family and friends but the overwhelming emotion for me is relief that stage 7 will not last long.

Psalm 22:1-2 The Message     ""God God...my God!     Why did you dump me     miles from nowhere?  Doubled up with pain I call to God     all the day long.  No answer.  Nothing.  I keep at it all night tossing and turning.""  Psalm 143:4-5 The Message  ""I sat there in despair my spirit draining away     my heart heavy like lead.  I remembered the old days     went over all you've done pondered the way you've worked.""  me:  In Psalms 22 (GNT) David cries out to our God ""Why have you abandoned me?""  He vents about his loss of strength and wonders why God is not answering him; it seems he is left for dead.  Familiar?  I suspect many of us caregivers feel weak fragile and almost dead sometimes.  I know I did.  Often!  Often I wanted to be anywhere  except feeding my mother one spoon full after the other or sitting her on the toilet.....waiting.....waiting.  Later in Psalm 22 (GNT) David has advice for each of us when God seems too far away and we feel blue and gloomy.  He writes ""I will tell my people what you have done; / I will praise you in their assembly.""     Next time we are tempted to feel sorry for ourselves we can emulate David by remembering the good things God has done for each one of us.  We might want to sit with pen and paper title it THANK YOU GOD FOR and begin our list to use today and when needed in the future.  Then we will joyfully and gladly worship and praise our God with thanksgiving for others to read and hear or in our private prayer time.

And very briefly on the science.  Oxidants in Alzheimer's disease (first hydrogen peroxide and then peroxynitrite) damage receptors enzymes and transport systems reducing levels of neurotransmitters needed for the recall of short-term memory sleep mood social recogntion and alertness limit the transport of glucose and the flow of blood in the brain which can lead to delusions at very high levels due to psychological stress can cause hallucinations prevent the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus and lead to the death of neurons.  The strongest and most bioavailable oxidant scavengers not only limit the formation of oxidants and reduce their levels in the brain they also partially reverse the damage listed above.    Now to the evidence.    Aromatherapy   Effect of aromatherapy on patients with Alzheimer's disease   Methods:   After a control period of 28 days aromatherapy was performed over the following 28 days with a wash out period of another 28 days. Aromatherapy consisted of the use of rosemary and lemon essential oils in the morning and lavender and orange in the evening [with a diffuser; direct inhalation might be better]...    Results:    All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores.    http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1479-8301.2009.00299.x/abstract     Scent Memory Links Studied     The study underway in long-term care facilities enables Loy to look at how appetite and moods are affected by the scents. As a way to stimulate appetite a mix of grapefruit and cloves is sprayed on patients’ bibs before mealtime. A mix of grapefruit and frankincense is used to help curb the so-called Sundown symptoms that often occur during the early evenings. Participants who receive one scent do not receive the other scent...    “It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately it’s like she has been reborn” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”    Beverly Health Care recreational therapist Amy Smith who directs the study with nine patients at the care facility said that keeping residents off medications helps them to be more alert and aware of their surroundings and more willing to engage with others.    “I’m glad we did this. We weren’t sure what to expect and in a few weeks we’ve noticed she (Mary) is different now.    http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/newsstory.cfm?ID=947   Lavender and Old Lace  To calm agitated dementia patients some caregivers are turning away from sedatives and toward aromatherapy  Benjamin Pearce president of a chain of assisted living homes for people with dementia puts his hand in a cardboard box and in a split second has a string of rainbow-colored flowers around his neck. Here he stands in his office on a Monday morning intense pale blue eyes set in a stern face now wearing a white dress shirt a tie — and a lei. “We use this sometimes as a delivery system” he says without cracking a smile. In a flash the Hawaiian garland is back in the box.    The lei is one way Pearce delivers aromatherapy to the elderly residents in his 12 New Jersey facilities. He also instructs his staff to spritz lavender on their pillows and mix six drops with their bathwater. Other natural oils such as citrus blends and rosemary are added to humidifiers massaged into patients’ skin or pumped into the air via diffusers. “I’m the most pragmatic person you’ll ever meet and I am totally sold on aromatherapy” Pearce says.   Aromatherapy is becoming an increasingly accepted treatment option for a group that frequently does not get the care it deserves: elderly institutionalized dementia patients. Zoned out without any appetite dementia patients are sometimes agitated violent and driven to wander. They are often given sedatives or antipsychotics. But these drugs have serious side effects including an increased risk that frail patients will fall and severely injure themselves.    http://scienceline.org/2011/03/lavender-and-old-lace/   Once a Monastery Now a Sanctuary for the Dementia Stricken  Site of new memory care home formerly owned by Benedictine sisters  When the weather warms residents will have the opportunity to go outside for supervised gardening.

Maggie: A Case Study In Dementia Care   Clues For Making Maggie Happier    To try to make bathing more pleasant staff decided to heat the bathroom before taking her in and dry her off with towels fresh from the dryer. They also installed a rolling shade over the sink mirror as Maggie appeared to be fearful when she saw the person in the mirror.    Another strategy they tried was intensive aromatherapy. Caregivers rubbed the essential oil of lavender on her skin every two hours to surround her in a familiar and comforting scent.   Just in case Maggie was experiencing some level of pain Clairmont’s staff made sure one of the essential oils that eases muscle stiffness joint pain and aches was rubbed into her body first thing in the morning when the elderly tend to be most stiff and uncomfortable.   Staff noticed she had difficulty finding the right word when she wanted to express herself so they worked hard to understand the particular way her mind tended to find a certain kind of word when reaching to express a completely different one.   All of this required intensive one-on-one time getting to know Maggie very well.   Because Maggie so clearly needed comfort staff took every opportunity to give her a warm hug or sit or walk with her holding her hand so that she might feel less alone in this strange new world her brain had drawn her inexorably into. Staff discovered that Christian music gave her joy so they played it for her frequently.   A couple of weeks passed and gradually Maggie became calmer and more at ease.      Their efforts were so successful that Maggie was able to go entirely off the lethargy-inducing Ativan she had been taking three times a day. She doesn’t even need it PRN (as needed) anymore. Staff even discover to their delight glimpses of joy in Maggie’s eyes.    http://www.providermagazine.com/archives/archives-2012/Pages/0912/Maggie-A-Case-Study-In-Dementia-Care.aspx                  Clearing the Fog in Nursing Homes   The woman who was in her 90s had lived for several years at the Ecumen Sunrise nursing home in Two Harbors Minn. where the staff had grown accustomed to her grimaces and wordless cries. She took a potent cocktail of three psychotropic drugs: Ativan for anxiety and the antipsychotic Risperdal to calm her plus an antidepressant. In all the time she’d lived at Sunrise she hadn’t spoken. It wasn’t clear whether she could recognize her children when they came to visit.    So the home trained its entire staff (housekeepers cooks dining room servers everyone) in a variety of tools to calm and reassure its 55 residents: exercise activities music massage aromatherapy. It taught people the kind of conversation known as “redirecting” — listening to elders and responding to them without insisting on facts that those with dementia can’t absorb or won’t recall.    The results startled even the believers however. Every resident on antipsychotics (about 10) was able to stop taking them and 30 to 50 percent of those taking antidepressants also did well without them. When drugs still seemed necessary “we tried to reduce them to the lowest dose possible” Ms. Lanigan said.   Of course you can’t tell how well nondrug approaches work based on one facility’s outcomes. “We know how to reduce behavior problems and mood issues in controlled clinical trials” said Kimberly Van Haitsma a senior research scientist at the Polisher Research Institute in Philadelphia. “The actual nuts and bolts of how do you do this and keep it in place — over not weeks or months but years — is a question the field is struggling with.” Turnover among both staff and residents is high in nursing homes she pointed out.   But with reduced medications the woman at the Two Harbors home did seem to awaken. She was able to speak — haltingly and not always understandably but enough to communicate. And what she let Ms. Lanigan know after years of being virtually nonverbal was that she was suffering physical pain the cause of her crying out.       https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/clearing-the-fog-in-nursing-homes/    Ecumen video:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKN3DGxl06o",False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539170,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her appetite and fluid intake are waning.  If she eats an entire yogurt in a day and has 10 ounces of a protein drink we consider that a success.  We are not forcing anything.  We offer and if the mouth opens we provide.  If she shakes her head no or turns her head we try to respect it.  Sorry for being long winded.  I guess my questions (which of course I'll ask hospice again) is...is the experiencing pain?  If these are hallucinations we obviously don't want her being afraid.  What can we do?  How can we help?  And how long can someone at this stage last?,False,tellas33,2016-05-09,21.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147539007,,,AlzConnected,,,

My step-mother was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's (her mother has it also who is in her 90's and is in a nursing home). My neighbor and cousin (on my hubby's side) has early onset Alzheimer's. I will say hers is progressing rapidly (which I've read it progresses quickly). My father in law had Alzheimer's. He passed away several yrs. ago. So I feel I've been surrounded with Alzheimer's. Also most of my colleagues at work have at least one parent with the disease.  Anyway sorry for the long intro. Well lately my mother in law has complained her stomach hurts. Then she's fine. When she has a meal she doesn't eat everything like she used too. This has gone on for a week now. She also is sleeping a lot. Usually she is up all day and has some nights where she is constantly up. Yes she is on sleeping meds but soon it stops working. She's been on a lot of different ones and we just stopped them a year ago. She is not on any Alzheimer's medications anymore. She only wanted to be on them for 1 year. She didn't feel it helped her husband when he was on it and I tend to agree with her on that. I know it affects every person differently. So we tried to get her a drs. appointment which is next monday unless someone cancels. They are packed with the flu going around. I teach so yes its bad here.

So its been a fun time lately lol.    My father in law slept a lot in the last stage of Alzheimer's but he wasn't eating at all or talking. I don't feel she is at that stage.

I also would like to know what s best for her being in a specialise unit with other people like her OR in a normal retirement house that takes alzheimer's patient but do not have a protected section.    My mum usually imitiates people around and usually go and sit with the nurses where she is looking like she fits in.    Anyone could advise? I have the choice between 2 places one specialised unt of 13 bed or the other house that was reommended by a woman who had her husband with Alzheimer and was very happy of that house.

Irregardless I'm new to all of this and wanted to post my story and ask for any help or insight you may be able to give me.   My Dad has what doctors call Dementia but think it may be becoming Alzheimers From looking at this site it seems like he's in the/a middle stage.   I am 37 years old an only child (my older brother passed away when I was in my 20s). My parents are divorced but my mom helps out with my Dad a lot. My other family comes and goes when it pleases them so it's really just me and my mom. My mom lives out of town so in the end it's really just me. I like a short trip from my Dads (used to be walking distance but now it's a small drive).   Growing up I didn't have the best relationship with my father. He wasn't the nicest parent to have. But now that he's sick I feel a responsibility to care for him. The issue is he still has his temperament. So that tied with the Dementia/Alzeimers has become exhausting. For example he is having some physical health issues (lump on chest difficulty breathing lightheadedness). I moved his doctors apt to this week because I""m concerned and he gets angry. Tells me he isn't going to die today and he wants to leave his schedule as is. What he doesn't realize is that he tells me everyday he doesn't feel well and that hurts me and gives me horrible anxiety. So why won't he just go to the doctors apt for me? Or how do I just ""not care"" and let him do things on his own terms.   I'm also still learning about the disease in general. He doesn't remember what he has but gets frustrated by it. I don't understand the physical aspects of it now and honestly don't know if I'm ready to learn about them at the moment. Today has been a rough day so was yesterday.  It has only been about 2 years since the diagnosis but I am becoming exhausted. Everyday or phone call is a different personality a new issue a concern I get stressed about. He suffers from depression so he doesn't mind feeling the pain but can't see that it hurts me and I honestly don't think he cares (his temperament)...   I get angry I'm short in my responses (which I am so trying to stop but can't help it and then I feel like sh-- after). I just don't know what to do. I'm looking for a therapist but I feel so alone in this (especially when like today my mother and I disagree on what to do). Sometimes he realizes he's sick but a lot of the time he doesn't but either way won't let me help him. It's all I think about and can no longer differentiate my life and his but I know I need to have my own life to survive. But how do you get a grown man to listen to you?     Sorry this was all over the place. My head feels like mush this morning. I'm trying to work and juggle working on his POA and doctors appointments all at once.",False,BrooklynGirl80,2017-02-20,27.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147538590,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her mobility is very bad.  She has a knee and a hip that are bone in bone and this up until now has been the biggest issue.  So with this back ground here I go.  About 2 months ago she fell and really bruised her foot very badly.  She was still walking on it however.  Then about 3 weeks ago she had periods of time when she said her legs would give out.  She just seemed to be getting weaker or something.  It was very noticeable.  She just looked like the days were getting hard.  Then two days before Christmas she took to her bed.  Couldn’t get up barely lift her head had to be almost carried to her bedside commode finally got depends on her.  Had a cough.  Not bad but still a cough.  No fever.  Couldn’t hold her head up.  She had been on hospice once before so instead of calling an ambulance on Christmas Eve I text the hospice nurse.  Mom gets extremely agitated at the doctors office or hospital and frankly I just wanted someone to check and see if I needed to take her to the hospital.  Two nurses came and they felt like her cancer was progressing and she had just held on going and going and it was now catching up with her. They suggested calling the oncologist who put her back on hospice.  Fast forward to today.  She can get out of bed walk with her walker is eating very little but some.  Sleeping in her chair or in bed most of the day and night.  Still coughing.  Her cognitive abilities seemed weird to me. It’s like she is trying to go through the motions of routines but she doesn’t look like she is comprehending what she is doing.  Does that make sense?  The things she CAN do seem like rote archives rather than even anything remotely purposeful.  Idk hard to describe.  Barely taking at all.    I know you aren’t doctors and don’t have crystal balls but you do have experience.  My caregiver group said she is depressed hospice says she is just in early stages of shutting down I still wonder why she has this cough and if she could have just had pneumonia.  Should I be taking her to the doctor?  Should I just keep her on hospice?  Are her activities just rote routunes?

I was told last night when I went home she didn't eat her dinner. This morning she was in alot of pain and they gave her some pain meds which helped. They said she ate her breakfast ok. When I got here to be with her she was being her normal self joking around and happy. She did good with her therapies today too. At lunch she refused to eat but I thought it was because she was tired from getting up early for breakfast therapy and the day's activities. She slept for like 4 hours in the afternoon. Then it was time for dinner and she refused to eat her dinner. I pleaded with her to eat and she got mad at me and still didn't eat it. I got frustrated and teary which I don't think helped anything. So I told the aide if she gets hungry I will ring for them to get her an after hours meal. She sleeping again but honestly I'm worried. She refused to let them get her ready for bed tonight. I don't know what's going on with her. She wasn't like this before. I'm afraid that they're gonna put a feeding tube in her if she doesn't eat. I've been with her pretty much day and night since she's been here. I hope she's not using me being here or not being here as an excuse to eat. She's been doing so well I don't want her to regress. Am I over reacting? I feel stuck: I'm doing everything and I need a break but I don't want to be a hinderance to her progress either. What do I do to help her?

One Sunday prior to Thanksgiving I had to take my wife (Alzheimer's) to the ER with some stomach issues. She was having agitation issues due to the Alzheimer's plus she was in pain with her stomach...during the exam she made the comment (and maybe several times as she wouldn't let me in the room) that she ""wanted to die"". Because of that comment she was ""required"" to talk to a psychiatrist via video chat (which happened around midnight after she had been asleep for several hours). Of course after being wakened she was in no condition to answer questions cohesively. Well because of all of this she was involuntarily committed and was to be transferred to a facility to handle such issues as soon as room became available. I even asked one of the people at the hospital if I dressed her and we headed out would we be stopped....the answer was yes we would. Two days later she was transferred to a facility 1 1/2 hours away and I was only allowed to visit for 90 minutes at a time. I knew once I saw where she was housed that she definitely didn't belong there.        I let them know that I wanted her out that she didn't belong there and I was told that it was usually a 10 day commitment. I called everyone that I could think of....lawyers doctors mental health workers alzheimer's association....trying all that I could do to get her out. I finally got her released after 5 days.       Here's what I'm seeking advice about; I don't think we should be liable for the out of pocket costs (except that portion where she went to the ER). I've talked to both the hospital and the facility letting them know my sentiments that it's synonymous with being put in jail for 5 days and then getting a bill for the incarceration. I let them know that Alzheimer's is NOT a mental illness and shouldn't fall under the same auspices as mental health...I even quoted supreme court case from another state to that fact and that people with Alzheimer's are not supposed to be involuntarily committed.    If anyone here has any advice on how to further articulate my position or any information that I could relay to either the hospital or behavioral facility that would help it would be greatly appreciated.",False,JAR143,2017-11-10,9.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147538781,,,AlzConnected,,,

Read all 22....                   1.  It's time to use the money you saved up.  Use it and enjoy it.  Don't just keep it for those who may have no notion of the sacrifices you made to get it.  Remember there is nothing more dangerous than a son or daughter-in-law with big ideas for your hard earned capital.  Enjoy the present moment. The sand in the clock may run out at any moment.    2.  Stop worrying about the financial situation of your children and grandchildren. You've taken care of them for many years and you've taught them what you could.  You gave them an education food shelter and support.  The responsibility is now theirs to earn their way.    3.  Keep a healthy life with moderate exercise (like walking every day) eat well and get your sleep.  It's easy to become sick and it gets harder to remain healthy.  Keep in touch with your doctor get tested even when you're feeling well.   Stay informed.    4.  Always buy the best most beautiful items for your significant other.  The key goal is to enjoy your money with your partner.  One day one of you will miss the other and the money will not provide any comfort then.  Enjoy it together.    5.  Don't stress over the little things.   You've already overcome so much in your life.  You have good memories and bad ones but the important thing is the present.   Don't let the past drag you down or the future frighten you.     6.   Regardless of age always keep love alive.   Love your partner love life love your family love your neighbor your surroundings your country.   We are never old as long as we have intelligence and affection.    7.  Be proud both inside and out.   Don't stop going to your hair salon or barber.  Do your nails go to the dermatologist and the dentist.   Keep your perfumes and creams well stocked.   When you are well-maintained on the outside it seeps in making you feel proud and strong on the inside.    8.  Don't lose sight of fashion trends for your age but keep your own sense of style. There's nothing sillier than an older person trying to wear the current fashion among youngsters.   You've developed your own sense of what looks good on you - keep it and be proud of it.   It's part of who you are.    9.  Read newspapers watch the news.   Go online and read what people are saying.  Make sure you have an active email account and try to use some of those social networks.  You'll be surprised which old friends you'll meet.   Keeping in touch with what is going on and with the people you know is important at any age.      10.  Respect the younger generation and their opinions.   They may not have the same viewpoints as ours but they are the future and will take the world in their direction.  Give advice not criticism and try to remind them of yesterday's wisdom that still applies today.    11.  Never use the phrase:  ""In my  time.""  Your time is now.   As long as you're alive you are part of this time.   You have been younger but you are still you now having fun and enjoying life.     12.  Some people embrace their golden years while others become bitter and surly.   Life is too short to waste your days in the latter mode.   Spend your time with positive cheerful people it'll rub off on you and your days will seem that much better.   Spending your time with bitter people will make you older and harder to be around.     13.  Do not surrender to the temptation of living with your  children or grandchildren (if you have a financial choice that  is).  Sure being surrounded by family sounds great but we all need our privacy.   They need theirs and you need  yours.   If you've lost your partner (our deepest  condolences) then find a person to move in with you and help out only if you feel you really need the help or do not want to live alone.    14.  Don't abandon your hobbies.   If you don't have any make new ones.   You can travel hike cook read dance.   You can adopt a cat or a dog grow a garden play cards checkers chess dominoes golf.   You can paint volunteer at an NGO or collect certain items.   Find something you like and spend some real time having fun with it.    15.  Even if you don't feel like it try to accept invitations.   Baptisms graduations birthdays  weddings conferences.   Try to go.   Get out of  the house meet people you haven't seen in a while experience something new (or something old).   But don't get upset  when you're not invited.   Some events are limited by resources and not everyone can be hosted.   The important thing is to leave the house from time to time.  Go to museums go walk through a field.   Get out there.    16.  Be a conversationalist.    Talk less and listen more.   Some people go on and on about the past not caring if their listeners are really interested.  That's a great way of reducing the desire to speak with you.  Listen first and answer questions but don't go off into long stories unless asked to.  Speak in courteous tones and try not to complain or criticize too much unless you really need to.  Try to accept situations as they are. Everyone is going through the same things and people have a low tolerance for hearing complaints.  Always find some good things to say as well.      17.  Pain and discomfort go hand in hand with getting older.  Try not to dwell on them but accept them as a part of the cycle of life we're all going through.  Try to minimize them in your mind.  They are not who you are they are something that life added to you.  If they become your entire focus you lose sight of the person you used to be.    18.   If you've been offended by others forgive them.   If you've offended someone - apologize.   Don't drag  resentment around with you.   It will make you sad and bitter.  It doesn't matter who was right.   Someone once said ""Holding a grudge is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die.""  Don't take that poison.   Forgive and move on with your life.    19.  If you have a strong belief savor it.   But don't waste your time trying to convince others.  They will make their own choices no matter what you tell them and it will only bring you frustration.   Live your faith and set an example.   Live true to your beliefs and let that memory sway them.    20.  Laugh.  Laugh A LOT.  Laugh at everything.   Remember you are one of the lucky ones.  You managed to have a life a long one.   Many never get to this age never get to experience a full life.   But you did. So what's not to laugh about?  Find the humor in your situation.    21.  Take no notice of what others say about you and even less of what they might be thinking.   They'll do it anyway and you should have pride in yourself and what you've achieved.   Let them talk and don't worry.   They have no idea about your history your memories and the life you've lived so far.   There's still much to be written so get busy writing and don't waste time thinking about what others might think.  Now is the time to be free at peace and as happy as you can be!                            22.  Remember do your portion to “Make America Great Again”.",False,DavidTX,2014-02-28,448.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147538951,,,AlzConnected,,,

When I am calm and sweet to her she mocks me in a sweet voice when I get stern she gets threatening when we just "" let it be"" there are messes and my father gets stressed and has chest pain again...is this just a phase that passes? We were having to help her walk not to long ago??? There are good times that we cherish Christmas was actually a good day!

458,62104b1e7b65de9a5b65ff53,2147538166,2017-12-16 07:10:00,Feeling alone(4),This is my first post and probably way over due.  Please forgive my rambling but I want to give some background and what’s been building up inside.  I am definitely having a ‘pity party’. My mother and step-father who I call dad have both been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and much to my concern and disagreement still live alone.  They have been married for over 40 years and still act like they are on their honeymoon.  They still hold hands when they walk together and are madly in love with each other.  I live over 2000 miles away but I do get to visit every 6-8 weeks for 3-5 days at a time.  I usually spend 8-10 hours a day of uninterrupted time with them.   My mother has a twin sister who visits for 6-8 months from another state and stays with them in a 2 bedroom condo.  She has dementia but my cousins are in complete denial.  The twins are inseparable.  My brother and sister in law live less that 20 min. away from my parents.  They see my parents on a weekly basis but it is usually in the company of many other people.  They also have 4 children (3 adult age) who still live at home and my brother has his own company where he works 7 days a week for over 10 hours daily. My other brother lives less that 1000 miles away and is basically non existent.  I am the oldest and have always been the one to have the difficult conversations.  Over the past few years friends of my parents as well as myself have expressed concerns with their driving and their living alone.  My brother has resisted saying it is not time.  He hates any kind of conflict.  Prior to visiting my parents last week we learned that my mother has breast cancer (very small lump).  The good news is it is not aggressive and the doctors believe that with medication it will shrink and possibly disappear.  The docs told me that she will be on the meds for 3-4 months and cannot miss a day.  Knowing that neither of my parents remember to take their meds daily (according to them there is always left overs at the end of the week).  With agreement from my brother I moved forward to get someone in 4 hours daily.  I was there for the first 4 days to help with the transition.  My mother became a rebel.  She stayed in her bedroom during the 4 hours and asked non-stop ‘why is she here how long is she staying and how can we get rid of her’.  She drove us all crazy.  At one point my father said ‘you have asked the same question 7 times in the last 10 min and we keep going you the same response.’  Of course my mother said she knew that but she does not want the CNA and does not need her.  She also kept talking about needing her privacy.   After going through their meds with the CNA we learned that dad got pills mixed up his in her container and hers in his and on some days doubling up. And to think this was only a weeks worth of pills we were examining.  I know that getting someone in was way over due but at least I can rest knowing that their meds are being taken daily especially the cancer pill.  Prior to visiting I also made arrangements for driving assessments thru a private company.  I explained that friends and family have shared for many years of concerns with their driving.  I told them that I am not an expert and have not seen them drive so I have hired a private company.  They asked if their liscense could be taken away where I responded with no this is not the DMV.  They both agreed to the assessment which lasted over 2 hours each. My father had an anxiety attach which I thought was his heart.  We talked while my mother was assessed.  After 2 hours of talking he was good to take the assessment.  (I feel like I need a degree in marriage and family counseling.)  Results of Moms assessment was shared prior to him being tested.  She failed the cognitive and perceptual tests as well as the driving.  She was told that she should not drive and is lucky to not have been killed or killed someone else.  With this my father started to cry and say ‘I could have lost you’.  Mom kept on saying that she will not drive a lot only to Walgreens and we kept saying no more driving for her.  The results from my fathers testing was very similar.  He used excuses for why he drove the way he did. ‘There was no one on the road so who cares if I drive over the speed limit and on the wrong side or in the middle of the street.’  I know that I rocked their world as they knew it.  They both became so angry with me.  My mom said I lied to her and if she knew about the test she would have never agreed.  My brother and I decided to keep the car so the CNA can drive them around.  We also have uber set up for them.  I knew I made the right decision but felt completely beat up.  We were way over due in getting someone in with to take the keys away from them. I know that no matter how or when these were addressed it was going to be difficult.  Upon my arrival home my brother called saying my father took an Uber to the hospital because of chest pain.  He spent 2 nights in the hospital where they found no heart concerns.  They said it was anxiety.  I think this may have to do with the fact that the twin shows up on Tuesday and my mom has not shared anything with her hoping it will all go away. My mom stayed at my brothers house.  My brother shared that my mother is very angry with me.  He did defend me and at one point he yelled at her for acting childish.  These 2 days were probably the longest he has been alone with them.  He finally agreed that we need to move them to assisted living by summer 2018.  We have a place which  is to open in April or May.  Since returning home my mother has not answered many of my calls been extremely cold when she does answer and locked the CNA out numerous times.  The CNA has been making progress with them and they have become less defiant with her.  The CNA is a saint.  I learned that my mother has said that she never wants to speak or see me ever again.  I have never heard words like this come from my moms mouth.  I know this is the disease and not my Mom whom I love so very much but none the less it is wripping my heart out.  My husband friends and my brother have been incredibly supportive but her no longer saying ‘I love you’ at the end of my calls is tearing me up.  I have cried more this past week than I have in a year combined.  I read and educate myself about the disease but nothing prepared me for the grief of no longer having my mom.  Her twin shows up on Tuesday.  I know she will add fuel to the fire and get Mom all wound up.  I think it is going to get much more difficult.  I prep myself prior to every call I make to Mom trying to stay upbeat and not defending the actions I took.  I dread having my aunt there as I know she will support Mom needing her privacy.  I read someone’s post and it really resonated with me.  They said that you don’t know what this disease is like until you are ‘in it’ with a LO.  I will continue to love my Mom as I always have and do my best not to react to this person the disease has taken.  Thank you so much for listening and again forgive me for rambling.,False,Yvonne_D,2017-12-02,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147538166,,,AlzConnected,,,
459,62104b367b65de9a5b65ffd7,2147538234,2017-12-20 01:37:00,Emergency move from MC,Please help me think through what I need to do tomorrow which is get my mom out of her MC facility immediately and into someplace safe while we find a new place for her. I am so angry I am shaking. Let me preface this by saying my mom is in a very nice facility -- at least we thought it was nice. It is NOT cheap. We had not noticed any problems during visits other than a urine smell in her room. She's totally incontinent and fights them about her diapers and we figured there would be some of that. This was supposed to be a place where she could move through all stages of care including into hospice. It has turned into a nightmare.  Tonight my brother got a call from the MC saying our mom had fallen out of bed and was injured. They asked him what hospital to take her to. (Shouldn't that be on file?) My brother called me to say he was on the way to the hospital. (I live three hours away.) When he got there she had terrible bruises and huge knots on her head face and hands was wearing a neck brace and was moaning and crying in pain. The doctor sent her for CT scan which showed no internal bleeding or broken bones so they released her.   When my brother and SIL took her back to her MC they found that her queen-size bed had been removed and that she was sleeping on a bed that looked smaller than a twin like a hospital bed without rails. She is a large person and that bed is way too small. THEY HAD CHANGED HER BED WITHOUT TELLING US! Or asking us to get her a new one! My brother asked why they had done that and the very young girl on duty -- one staffer in a place with 20+ residents -- said they had had such a bad problem with bed bugs. BED BUGS?! No one told us there was a problem with bed bugs.  The floor in her room was filthy with dirt crumbs and what appears to be RAT PELLETS and some kind of sticky substance where you could clearly see footprints on the floor.  The staffer started to argue with my brother and tell him how abusive and aggressive our mom is like somehow that was a defense. She is abusive and aggressive. We pay them a lot of money to take care of her and keep her clean and safe. If she's fighting them when they try to care for her shouldn't they 1) work with her doctor to address the behavior and 2) TELL US THERE IS A PROBLEM?  My SIL was in her room three weeks ago and everything was normal. My brother was there the week before but sat with her in the living area and didn't go into her room. I honestly cannot understand what has happened.  I'm driving up first thing in the morning to ask a lot of POINTED questions and to find a place to move her. I'm thinking the thing to do is get her to a place with respite care for a couple of days while we find a new place. We'll leave her stuff and get everything new because of the possibility of bed bugs. Then we'll be filing a complaint with the company and the state regulatory agency. I don't know how to find the family members of the other residents to tell them what happened but I will try.  Has anyone gone through this? Have any tips?

This is my first post.  My father has recently ended up in long-term care in a dementia ward and generally we are incredibly impressed with the level of care and even love the staff gives to the residents.  However my father is not able to ask to go to the bathroom and is often left needing to go and has the body impulses or memory to hold it in but that brings him increasing amounts of pain and discomfort and when he finally does end up going in his pants it leads him to become very frightened and confused because he doesn't know what is happening. Tomorrow is our first care meeting and I would like to ask them to take him to the bathroom more frequently but I am wondering how frequently is reasonable.  A care consultant from Alzheimers Association said every two hours and I was wondering what some of your experiences are.

461,62104b8a7b65de9a5b6601f7,2147538023,2017-12-06 14:54:00,frustrated. need to vent,So since it's my first post let me introduce myself: I'm a 24 year old female living on and off  with my grandpa and my uncle (switching between living alone and with my mom every so and so) since 2010 due to the fact that i cannot live with my mom due to her mental instability and the cohabitation issues it causes also i've noticed we get along better when i don't share a place with her and have also historically gotten along better with my extended family in this case my uncle and grandpa.  so a little background about my current situation: my grandpa was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease i believe in 2013-2014-ish. i'm not exactly sure when but the symptoms go as far back as 2009. nothing too overt though just things we would gloss over and shrug off as consequences of aging.   i'd say the decline has been very rapid though specially since late 2015 one week he was driving and going to work normally and then the next week he had to be forcefully -and silently- retired and his car taken away due to an out-of-the-blue wandering incident in which he tripped got hurt real bad and became very disoriented and just stayed sitting on the curb unable to walk back home due to the pain and disorientation. thankfully it happened near the house so my aunt (who lives a 10 min walking distance away) was able to find him and take him back home. unfortunately this became a watershed moment in the -already strained- relationship between my aunt and uncle and their fundamental disagreements in regards to the care my grandpa needs.   so my uncle advocates for allowing my grandpa as much independence as possible or to it's effect creating an illusion of independence (i'll elaborate on this later) whereas my aunt is on the side of medication and having a trained nurse or carer coming to the house and in the worst case scenario having him admitted to a home.  now a little background on my grandpa: he hails from the mexican equivalent of the bible belt so his upbringing has been reactionary catholic stern and traditional to it's core. even if he's not explicitly religious he does reproduce these (to my judgement) nefarious values he was brought up with. also with his impulse control being next to 0 he has more often than not allowed his true colors to show in casual conversation and in his relationship to his environment making his exchanges with people...awkward to say the least. add that to his inherent stubbornness and the fact that he's a doctor with a modicum of prestige and renown. so in short: he by default thinks he's above everyone else has always been unable to accept any of his faults shortcomings or the fact that he doesn't have to know ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. i think it's redundant for me to say the disease exacerbates these horrible flaws in his character.  now for about a year or so he's become extremely agitated and aggressive and he gets progressively worse with time. he wanders around the house picking fights with everyone about the pettiest crap he can come up with and makes everything a huge argument and borderline deathmatch when the original issue was -for instance- that i was looking for a paper clip in a drawer  (i'm not exaggerating this is 100% no lie).    i'm not sure why but he has developed this beef specially with me and the handyman who's worked at my house for 3 decades. fortunately i have the option of just locking myself in my room and pretending i don't exist but he can't really hide from him so he gets constantly accosted and scolded and talked down and shouted at by my grandpa every time he feels it's time to pick a fight with an innocent passerby. i believe he genuinely wants to interact with us but given the fact that he's no longer capable of understanding sentences that are longer than 4 words (his working memory has gone to the shitter at this point) he gets extremely desperate and his only resource is lashing out. i have tried to tolerate this and tell myself it's the disease but i have severe inattentive ADHD (and i also suspect some form of ASD) which makes me hypersensitive to auditory and emotional stimuli and has made me prone to extreme anxiety so i just end up extremely upset/angry and violently shaking every time i try to have an interaction with him. he has driven me to tears more often than not. i can't even walk around my house carefree because everytime i bump into him i am in for a fight and i really don't have the mental fortitude or energy to deal with that every single day of the week.  i am 100% sure the geriatrician has recommended my grandpa medication for the above because the lady who does the cleaning chores at my house has told me my uncle has mentioned something of that nature to her. I of course have not been directly told by him any of this but then again ever since the disease took hold of my grandpa my uncle has become secretive sneaky manipulative and an all around liar. i believe this to be his way of keeping all control of the situation in his hands exclusively and not allowing anyone else to have a say on it (what can i say being a control freak runs in the family).   i have tried on my own accord suggesting asking the doctor for medication for my grandpa's agitation and the constant violence that stems from it but have only met resistance excuses and downright negatives from my uncle. you see he thinks medicating my grandpa for his constant mental discomfort qualifies as elder abuse and argues that the best alternative is allowing him to go out 3-5 times a day whenever he pleases (he thinks this will deplete him of his apparently infinite energy and that it'll  calm him down) and giving in to his daily tantrums instead of having him medicated and with a trained professional who can walk him around whenever he feels like going out instead of having us pause or activities to cater to his irrational needs.   sorry if the whole post is a mess i'm really bad at conveying my thoughts and writing coherently i think i might have missed a lot of stuff but i'll add it eventually lol,False,shinjilauper,2017-12-01,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147538023,,,AlzConnected,,,

463,62104b967b65de9a5b66024f,2147534951,2017-07-01 15:17:00,Absorbing the hatred gives me panic attacks,We recently moved my mother with dementia into a memory care home after my father who was her at-home caregiver passed away suddenly and probably due to grief reaction she had a health crisis and steep decline in cognition and physical strength. They had no support system in their home town and had become quite isolated so we moved her to a very nice facility in my city where I can visit her often and she has extended family who also come to see her.    She has unfortunately never liked me her only daughter very much and is much happier with and closer to her sons. When she was in crisis with her health she was sweet and grateful for my nursing and it was a pleasant time. I kind of let my guard down which was a mistake--I used to have stronger defenses against her. As she gets healthier she remembers who I am and her hatred of me has grown tenfold because she believes I'm the one who stole her house her dog and her money and imprisoned her in a home with crazy old people. She is often so confused she thinks I'm a nurse or her sister (she never had a sister) and days go more smoothly when this is the case. When she recognizes me as her daughter her agitation increases and her outright abuse is hard to take. Mocking me making fun of my appearance shouting at me that I killed my dad etc.    I feel like I'm being a baby but I'm having a hard time with it. I have a lot of strength and inner resources and have a lifetime of learning to protect myself against her frank preference of my brothers and open dislike of me. I don't let my young daughters visit her for very long any more because she has started to turn it on them as they grow out of the baby stage and I would like to protect them from it. It might be because my grief for my dad is so fresh and painful. We were really close and he was a wonderful person. Her accusations against me are so ugly and even though I know the words aren't true including my dad in the diatribes of what a terrible person I am is the thing that makes them unbearable. I am probably a little weakened by grief and most days I feel like I'm starting out a little wobbly and her words are like a kick in the face. I can't absorb her hostility that is so specifically targeted at me--it's like my walls are weakened or something.     She would rather that my brothers were her daily caretakers but that wasn't a reasonable option for her care for many reasons. She has always liked my husband a lot and he can sometimes bridge the trouble by staying with her for awhile when she needs help but can't stand to be around me. But he has a busy work schedule my brothers are all $$ plane flights away and the regular care falls to me. I try to be detached as if I'm a professional caregiver and try not to listen to her words or pretend they are about someone else. Sometimes it works.    The past two days I've come home from visiting her and had a full blown panic attack. The first time I really thought I was dying I could not catch my breath. I feel stupid about it because that's never happened before and I should have more mastery over my emotions.     I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else. If it were a complete personality change I might be able to attribute it to her illness and say she's not herself. I know her dementia is causing some of this. But she is so lucid and focused with her hatred of me for robbing her of everything and killing her husband and she touches on so many specific details of our past and she knows it's me she's talking to. She rehashes old arguments about what a terrible person I am and how I'm trying to take dad's affections from her wounds that I thought I had healed over. Obviously they have not.   I know it's probably a good idea to just leave her in the home to adjust by herself. My brothers will eventually be able to visit her there. She has extended family who have said they will come. She needs follow up medical treatment from her recent illnesses that is more comfort care than something the home would get in trouble for not providing if that makes sense.  I can't stand to think of her being in pain and alone. The staff is competent but she's frankly not very likable and I've seen them treat her professionally but without any compassion and often with impatience. There are enough times when she is happy to see me and thanks me for the cold compress or extra blanket or foot rub that I keep coming to see if I can help her. I don't know what to do.   This is way too long and I'm sorry. I was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.,False,CarlowChoir,2017-07-01,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534951,,,AlzConnected,,,

Today I treated an 88 year old female who came in with her husband (92) along with their caregiver. She in a wheel chair and him with a walker. They both had appointments. As I look at her health history and see all the same medications my mom has been on and needless to say this tugged at my emotions real hard. The patient was calm and cooperative and I did what I could keeping in mind not to agitate her. I put music on from her era and cleaned her up as efficiently and quickly as possible. Despite stopping a few times so she could go to the bathroom she did well.  I bring this up for a few reasons. Before my mom went down this road I didn't have any experience with this disease and when I saw a patient come in for a cleaning who's spouse brought them I didn't truly understand what they were going through. Now I have experience and I know what those patients who I treat and their spouses are going through. It has opened my eyes and made me a better hygienist in treating them. Work not only keeps me busy and meets my needs but has opened a door that I wasn't expecting. As I talk to the patients to get to know them I have found out that so many are on this same journey. I always tell them about this site and message board and how great it has been for me.   I won't lie it was difficult and I had to suck up the tears from starting when I took care of this patient because I saw my mom in her. And today my mom's hospice nurse called to give me an update that she's lost more weight and is not eating as much (which I know) &amp; she's managing well with her pain meds. She is shrinking ever so slowly and it breaks my heart. But one thing is for sure this journey and experience has changed my life and I will pass on to others what I have learned.,False,Wgonzo,2016-01-08,365.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147537553,,,AlzConnected,,,
465,62104baf7b65de9a5b6602db,2147537637,2017-11-14 21:01:00,Coping Mechanisms,Hi all - this is my first post here and it's not really something I've even spoken about much. I appreciate any advice.  My dad is 78 and was officially diagnosed about a year and a half ago (with symptoms a few years before then). It's been a gradual decline since the diagnosis and while his short term memory is pretty much shot he is still able to have a conversation recognize everyone in his life etc.  I would guess he is in the early to mid stages right now and his cognitive condition has been relatively stable for the last year.  There has unfortunately been a corresponding physical decline. His neurologist does not think it is because of the Alzheimer's - he thinks there is another neurological cause that we can't seem to pinpoint. In any event he stopped being able to walk about a year ago and is usually in a wheelchair (occasionally he can use a walker but his knees buckle). Over the past few months there have been a number of inexplicable accidents - he can't ever seem to explain what's happened but my mom will get home and find some diarrhea on the couch.   I don't live at home so this all falls on my mom. But when I do go home I find myself fixating on manifestations of the disease (like a mess on the couch) and I get either critical or depressed and can't stop focusing on it. We have a week-long family vacation coming up next week and I am stressing about the process of getting him there (airports transports etc. are a huge pain) but then also worrying about how he'll be when we're there: accidents doing stupid things etc. But he genuinely wants to be included on these trips so it is important that we take him.  Does anyone have any coping mechanisms for just enjoying the moment and being grateful for what I do have rather than constantly focusing on the disease and getting upset / critical / depressed / grossed out? My reaction comes from a good place but it doesn't make anyone happy.   Thank you.

467,62104bdc7b65de9a5b6603cf,2147536940,2017-10-08 18:08:00,Wheelchair or walker?,For the time being we've put my mom's move to a NH on hold as we were able to get Medicaid to finally pay attention to us.  They got us approved for pretty much full time caregivers at home. Well from 9am to 8pm with 2 consistent workers.  So far it has been a huge help.  My back is so much better with the help and my mother is very happy as well.  I think she loves the one on one attention she is getting.  My question regards the whole reason for the NH or full time caregivers.... she is so weak and walking tires her out so much that she threatens (not verbally!) to fall.  Right now we are using a walker to get up and moving every couple of hours during the day to toilet.  Sometimes we do a mirror dance to walk her to the bathroom and/or bed.  But even that 15 feet of a walk exhausts her.  She is on 1L of O2.  She is very sleepy and sleeps from 7/7:30pm to 9/9:30am.  And then a 2 hour nap in the afternoon and dozing in her chair periodically other times.  I get that this is normal for later stages I just didn't realize she had gotten to that place already.  4 months ago she was walking and talking coherently and now?    This morning she was up and seemed almost perky (and by that I mean she didn't have her usual flat affect) went to church came home ate a TINY bit took her pain pill and has been sleeping every since.  That just wore her out.  She has a doctor's appointment on the 19th.  I wonder if I shouldn't try to get her in sooner.  She has a neuropsych appt on the 17th as well. I wonder if her psych meds need to be adjusted down or something.    She also hasn't had a BM in 4 days but also hasn't eaten much in those days either.  Before that her BM's were always easy and daily so maybe that has something to do with it?  But basically should I move to using a wheelchair for her?  Or is it good for her to keep active even if it exhausts her?  I was of the mind to use a wheelchair while she was out and about but at home try to walk.  Now I'm wondering if even walking at home is just too much for her.  She will need to do a certain amount of getting up and down and walking up and down stairs until I can get a stair lift though so.....   My goal was to make sure this home care-giving was going to work before going further into home modifications.  Sorry this is so long.  Hopefully it makes sense.  I'm just the tiniest bit freaked out that she seems so tired and worried that she might be shutting down.,False,StarEcho,2017-06-08,159.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536940,,,AlzConnected,,,

He recalls asking the neurologist about a timeframe that he could expect to live after this diagnosis.  The doctor was very kind and explained that the disease is life-shortening but said he probably had years to live--maybe 10-15 years.  When the panic attacks began my husband began to focus on the numbers 10-15 and began to doubt the doctors words.  He now decided that he had 10-15 months to live---or maybe even 10-15 weeks.  He then decided that we were all withholding information from him and warned me of how he would react when he found out the ""truth.""  A great deal of time and energy has gone into looping conversations in which he asks me about telling the 'truth' and what the doctor meant with the numbers 10-15.    He has paranoia about my use of my phone or computer. He doesn't want me to leave the room to have a phone conversation because he thinks that anyone I am talking to is ""in"" on the conspiracy to withhold the truth. The same is true of typing conversations to my children or friends using Facebook or other media.  I am typing this now because he is asleep and I have five minutes of quiet.  The situation is worse because even if the doctor sends an email clarifying the diagnosis and life expectancy time line (which he did) now my husband thinks that he has Alzheimer's but he ALSO has something else (that we are not disclosing) and that this 'other' thing is going to kill him in much less than the years given by the doctor.  Last night he claimed he could actually hear his brain 'cracking' and said this was his proof that he is dying.  I am his primary caretaker.  We do have four adult sons (two from his previous marriage and two from my previous marriage) but they all have families and obligations and can't just run over to the house every time he has one of these episodes.    For meds he is only taking Mirtazipine 30 mg for depression and Klonopin .5 mg 2x daily for the anxiety. (He keeps telling me we are giving him meds because the pain is getting too much to bear).  I honestly don't know what to do.  I understand he has early-onset Alzheimer's but I somehow (stupidly) thought that we would have time to do things together. We used to sing in church together but he doesn't want to do that now. He won't plan activities with me either. I've been told that this is a phase and that he will come out of it---but his own personality is so stubborn and oppositional that I fear that he won't ever have a 'good' day again.    I am exhausted already and it has only been two months since diagnosed. Feeling alone and forgotten by those who said they would 'help' but the only help they give is to be judgmental and tell me I need to 'pace myself' or 'take care' of myself.    Feeling discouraged and alone",False,MicheleF,2017-09-29,9.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147537842,,,AlzConnected,,,

Nonambulatory incontinent higher lidt for transfer not oriented to time place person. She has no idea that she is in her home.  Complete assist with ADLs. She can (usually) feed herself but often requires a lot of cuing and reminders. Her appetite is still mostly good. We have a live-in unlicensed private hire Mon-Fri and agency HHA for days in the weekend. We take turns staying overnight: when I say ""take turns"" at least 50% of the time it is me driving 400 miles round trip to do so. Siblings? One lives a distance away and does what he can two are nearby...one of whom never shows up the other shows up for ten minutes at a time most days.    The live-in did a good job for what we hired her for: companion to a mobile continent at times confused elderly lady. Mom's status has changed; the aide is doing more than we hired her to do and is clearly operating out of her training and skill level. If you have read my posts before this is the aide that handled Mom's dislike of being transferred by putting pads in her diaper and leaving her in the chair for 12 hours at a time. Meals have become slipshod affairs; mom is living almost entirely on frozen food as when I buy fresh food I throw it out two weeks later as it is rotting in the refrigerator. I found some deficiencies in care which I have addressed but I really don't know what goes on every day. Trying to move and turn Mom single-handedly is very difficult--I have done it--and I am concerned that one person trying to turn her causes pain (as evidenced by Mom screaming) and I really think that one of these days her femur will snap from inappropriate technique. I assist with hands-on when I am there; I have tried scheduling a second aide to help with care; the live-in always finds fault with them and has picked fights with them. I believe that part of the reason she rejects assistance is because she wants to keep her job and will not admit she is in  over her head. Aide has needed many days off lately for personal business necessitating that we pay a second person in her absence.    I live out of town in another state. I work full-time thankfully with a somewhat flexible schedule. I drive there frequently to care for Mom in addition I am tasked with all of the grocery shopping household/hygiene products shopping medication prep orientation of agency aides supervision of aides and communication with Hospice and other care providers. Hospice has a tendency to call me in the morning and say they are coming in the afternoon; I simply can't drop everything and drive 200 miles to meet with them so much of my communication with them is via phone. I am not looking forward to another winter of hazardous highway driving. My health is suffering: weight gain stress depression anxiety and I have put off scheduling some much-needed appointments. My significant other is tired of hearing me vent complain and cry. I wish I could say that caring for Mom is a joy but as many of you know caring for a person with advanced dementia is drudgery.     Something has to give. Either mom has to go into a facility where she will have appropriate care or someone will have to live with her. That someone of course is me.  Selfishly I don't want to give up my well-paying job; I think I would have some difficulty getting back into the field after a hiatus of a few years. I would like the opportunity to save for my retirement I like my community and my home and I am fond of my partner. We found a good facility close to Mom which offers the full range of care she needs and is geared to people with dementia.  What's the problem? I mean besides my complete and utter selfishness? Local brother has control of the purse strings. He is obsessed with the idea that the ONLY way for Mom to go into a facility is for her to have an incident requiring 3 days of hospitalization (""3 midnights"" rule) then Medicare will pay for 100 days in a SNF. I have fruitlessly explained to him that 100 days is a maximum not a guarantee and that if Mom had an incident and were in a rehab facility she would be booted out sooner rather later since she would not be likely to make progress in rehab. Not to mention that an incident or accident would cause Mom pain and suffering. And that admission to SNF from hospital means first open bed not facility of choice. He and other local brother think facility would be awful and think Mom has a rich home life. Her rich home life consists of sitting in a chair watching TV while the aide plays with her phone interspersed with indifferent meals and changing her diaper. Brother has an unreasonable sense of loyalty to the aide despite having fought tooth and nail against hiring someone when Mom first needed help. When I point out deficiencies in care he is now sticking up for the aide at the expense of me.   This weekend has put me over the edge. I worked the holiday. Purse string brother was present for dinner at Mom's for how long I don't know. Other brother who lives five minutes away stayed home with his family. I got to Mom's and found the refrigerator completely empty except for some scraps of unappealing Thanksgiving leftovers.   Mom owns her home and has adequate financial resources for her care. I really don't care if all of her money is spent on her care. I believe that the role of the POA should be to use her resources to provide for her care not to ensure that he has a good inheritance.  Am I the interfering clueless out of touch out of state sibling who is seeking to shuck her responsibilities and guilt? Or am I seeing this situation clearly and recognizing that we have reached the limits of what can safely and appropriately be done at home? We have an opportunity to get Mom into a good facility that has an open bed now; that open bed will likely be filled soon.  Sorry for the length of this.

Mom has osteoporosis and arthritis.  I have talked to several of my friends that have gone through this with their mom or day. I was told they had aches all over.

I just can’t see momma continuing like this. She was slightly dehydrated already. It’s upsetting because some of my siblings are simply telling me it’s only going to get worse. I get so tired of hearing that. I understand there is no cure. But do I just let mom be in bed and do nothing. I just don’t know what to do. I have six siblings.

Is this a normal progression?  Dad is worried she is slumped over because her neck hurts and uses a heating pad occasionally to help alleviate the pain.  I believe it is another stage of the disease.  I'm sure a warm compress/heating pad does still benefit her because she is slumped over so much and her neck probably does get stiff and sore.

MIL stage 6 lives in AL moving to MC in January pulled muscle in back in October treated at ER tested for UTI's (negative) now basically non-ambulatory and eating very little food on palliative care did not get approved for hospice last week.            MIL wants to get up a few times an hour and walk (down the hall to the restroom etc).  She tries to get up but never manages she stops while getting up before her feet hit the ground.  No sign of pain and she is on tylenol motrin and a lidocaine patch.  During PT or when they come in to change her she gets a look of utter terror on her face and start screaming and sobbing that they are trying to kill her - this happens either on transfers or when they try to help her stand.  It's happened with the AL staff the PT staff our family and the palliative care doctor.  I have watched their approach and it is fantastic.  They will leave and come back and try again if she is too upset.  She is becoming weaker because she will not walk although she can walk and we've seen her take a few steps and those few steps are what is keeping her off of hospice.  Sometimes when they are out of the room she will transfer herself from her lift chair to her bed (only a few times a week).  She complains of pain in her leg but then if we ask her to point to where it hurts she's pointing to her arms hands chest everywhere BUT her leg.  Also PT put a lap blanket over her leg last week when she was complaining of pain and she instantly said the blanket cured the pain and she was fine.     My question is do we continue PT and try to get her mobile again? The PT person is seeing small improvements.  How do we address the screaming and sobbing with the two person lift?  She's been seen by two doctors and two RN's and none of them can detect any lingering pain.

My MIL wouldn't get up out of her chair even with two people assisting her she was screaming and sobbing - 'don't make me do this'.  It was heartbreaking.  Best we can tell no pain just some stiffness from being immobile and a huge fear of falling.  Her food intake was 1/2 cup of coffee and about 1/2 cup of fruit.  Staff told me she is now a two person transfer since she refuses to even stand up any longer (she can stand and shuffle but refuses to do so out of fear).  She will be released from PT due to not cooperating and the inability to make any progress.  Three weeks ago we could hardly keep up with her she walked so fast and she was eating 2 meals a day.      Tomorrow she is being admitted to hospice and she has been on palliative care for the last few weeks.  She has lost a lot of weight.  We are surprised that a pulled muscle could lead to this sudden and significant decline.   Other than her AD she is healthy.  She has been tested for a UTI her blood chemistry run her meds evaluated her pain is being managed so there really isn't much else we can offer her at this point.    Not sure I have a question but would appreciate hearing from others that have seen this type of sudden decline after a mild illness or injury.,False,rosepoint,2014-01-22,573.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147537363,,,AlzConnected,,,

I figured I would do it because this is what you do for your family. I did not expect it to be rewarding at all.   I am about a year into what I consider real caregiving. I had to take over his finances in the spring of last year. For me that marked the dividing line between helping out and caregiving.  For most of this time caregiving has been a battle and most of it was because of his personality and choices not his disability. I have had to find ways to get him to do what obviously has to be done. A large percentage of my time has gone into persuading him to do or not do one thing or another. He has been capable of cooperating; he just didn't feel like it. As things have progressed (ironic term) he has become more aware of his limitations and he has noticed that I do a great deal for him. He understands that he has been a pain in the butt a lot of the time and that he has made my life harder. He feels bad about it these days which is something I never saw coming and he has started to appreciate what I do.  I believe he has started to feel very badly about the way he has treated me and other people in the past.  Now he has less ability to change his ways but at least he feels something when he causes a problem for me. When he screws up because he can't help it and he sincerely wishes he had not inconvenienced me it feels a lot better than having him screw up on purpose because he feels entitled to be served.  I have changed too. In the past my dad's mind was sound and he made bad and selfish choices causing other people unnecessary misery with full awareness of what he was doing. Over the decades I got used to being angry with him over his ways and that habit persisted after he reached the point where his bothersome actions and words were caused mainly by his disability. I have been impatient with him when he has been trying. As it became clear to me that his attitude was changing and that it was wrong to be terse or overly assertive with him I had to work to change my mindset. I still have to remind myself that it's wrong to be upset with someone who can't do any better. It's like talking to my aunt who apparently thinks she had a love child with Elvis. There are certain people you should not hold completely accountable.  It seems that the changes in our interaction have changed our hearts. He sees me fixing problems he knows he caused every day and he sees that I am not nasty about it. He goes into his bathroom and sees that the floor and toilet have been cleaned. He sees his clean laundry waiting to be put away. He has started saying supportive things which is something he never did when he was young. When I make a mistake he tells me not to worry about it. When he was young he always berated people who made mistakes and did his best to make them feel like the mistakes were major catastrophes.   I used to feel that caring for him was a chore but now it feels more like a project. I want to do it well. I don't want him to feel abandoned or neglected.When he has a problem I can fix or which I should have prevented I take it personally. I want to get on top of things and make them right not just because annoying jobs have to be confronted grudgingly but also because I want to do right by him.  Because we are both changing we are getting more attached to each other and treating each other better. On top of that I'm becoming much more industrious patient and responsible. I have to have good habits in order to stay on top of things and the constant effort is changing my character. I'm more effective than I used to be and I am considerably less irritable even though the potential provocations have increased.   I wonder if other people see these changes in themselves and the people they care for. I'm relieved to get something positive out of this problem. It would be burdensome to go through this without some kind of reward.,False,Svc Monkey,2017-07-09,95.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536129,,,AlzConnected,,,

She also advised that it is possible that the wound will never fully heal due to the circumstances (which I understand).  Hopefully the antibiotic and anti-microbial dressing will take care of the infection but there is no guaranty.  What do I do if nothing works and hospice doesn't have the ability to do any more than what they are doing now?  Has anyone else been in this situation?  Sorry for the long post -- and thank you for any suggestions.",False,Luvsadog2,2017-07-19,31.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536685,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am waiting for her doctor to call back to see if we can discontinue the Flexeril today.  Possibly thinking about PT or rehab for her back pain.  Not sure how much she could follow to accomplish PT.  However the big issue is the AL wants to have an emergency care meeting where I suspect they are going to ask us to move her to somewhere else (NH or MC).  I think if we get her off the Flexeril we will see some improvement in her functioning (some not a complete recovery) so I am worried about moving her to a NH to find out in a month she really belongs in memory care.      Any suggestions for a next step?  Any experience with Flexeril with your LO's? What could we use to address her discomfort that won't cause these issues?  Anyone have experience with this?       I'm waiting for a call today from her doctor the facility and our GCM but am trying to think of all the options we may have before we agree to move her.  On another note she is early stage 6 so moderate-severe decline which will probably impact how we treat her issues.,False,rosepoint,2014-01-22,573.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536975,,,AlzConnected,,,

She has a lot of anxiety which is being managed with xanax quite successfully. She has gotten very weak and has almost no ability to stand and in addition has pain in her left knee due to bone-on-bone arthritis.  The situation: I had made an appointment for mom to go to the orthopedist for a cortisone and/or lubricant shot in her knee. I'm hoping for perhaps a bit less pain when she does stand or try to walk. It's hard to encourage someone to walk when you know it hurts them!   She had not had her hair washed in several weeks (she fights hygiene tooth and nail). The night before the appointment I suggested a shower so she would be fresh and clean for the doctor. She thought I was ridiculous and that the doctor would not be looking at her hair. Very true but it had started to smell and had a very greasy look. I suggested a compromise...that I take her into the beauty salon and wash her hair in the sink. She wasn't going for this idea either and said it was NOT a compromise because it would still mean that I was getting my way and bossing her around. She was very angry and refused help in the bathroom and said she wanted 'to leave this world'. She was also very afraid that because we were fighting (we weren't) that I would abandon her. I told her I would just cancel the appointment so she wouldn't have to shower. She thought that was a great idea. About 1/2 hour after I left (in high anxiety myself) I got a call from mom. She had showered and felt much better and was sorry for her behavior. I assured her that I hadn't been angry just frustrated and that I understood why she had been upset and that we were 'good'.  The next day when I got to the facility she was resisting the caregivers attempts to get her out of bed (at 12:45pm). She complied once I was there. I took her to the appointment (with help @ both ends in &amp; out of the car). She was cheerful and glad to go out for awhile.  She has no problem going to the doctor even if it means shots etc.  I was wondering how I should have handled this differently. Should I care if she smells and looks disheveled when we go out? (she's always disheveled a bit). Should I have taken her without insisting on hair washing? Was this appointment important enough to go through drama?  She ended up getting a cortisone shot and we're going back in 2 weeks for the lubricant (can't remember the name...chicken comb stuff). Should I make her wash her hair in 2 weeks????,False,ilovebutz,2016-04-16,40.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147536377,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her health history includes very common pain inducing conditions combined mainly:       trigeminal neuralgia     fibromyalgia      vascular dementia (which has made her a total care patient)      stroke (has resulted in left arm contracture and weakness)      arthritis (especially in the fingers)     After a UTI she was transferred to a nursing facility and placed on hospice.     She did not report trigeminal neuralgia/fibromyalgia-related pain in the months before she stopped communicating nor did she complain of pain from the other conditions. The only pain she complained of was from a previous fracture in her left shoulder due to a fall.    She had always been reluctant to disclose pain or discomfort but in recent weeks she has ceased verbal communication including any vocalizations (such as groaning) that could indicate discomfort.          er lucidity is unclear but it seems that she drifts in-and-out of alertness and a half-dozing state but due to her lack of communication it’s also unclear if this is delirium or disease progression.      The only means she communicates any form of pain/discomfort is through furrowing her brow. Her foot jerks intermittently throughout the day and sometimes wakes her at night. She flinches if touched there.          It’s unclear if these responses are due to pain anxiety/surprise or due to some other cause. Her left calf is really tight despite stretching.     The hospice and facility doctor don't visit often enough to understand her pain issues. I think it's some kind of neuropathic pain but I'm not a medical professional.         The family is considering giving her 5 mgs of Lexapro at night to avoid circadian disruptions while addressing any underlying depression/anxiety. When cognizant she was not one to express sadness. So I’m really not sure if she’s depressed delirious or just succumbing to the inevitable progress of vascular dementia.        In the meantime does anyone have any experience in caring for someone like my grandmother someone who’s always been really stoic?

They took her off the pain meds until I complained about it and asked if they didn't understand the connection between pain and agitation.... then they put her on Tramadol 50mg 4xper day.  That seemed to help tremendously.  Schedule it give it to her before her pain gets severe and she stays at a low level of pain and is much more easygoing.    They discharge her on this med and give me a script to fill at the local pharmacy.  Go to do that and pharmacist says that it's too much tramadol since she is on seizure meds and tramadol increases seizures. and then tells me two days later that the facility cancelled the script.  1st of all she was given seizure meds 2 years ago by a neurologist who apparently did an EEG and diagnosed her with epilepsy based on an EEG report that said ""abnormal awake drowsy &amp; asleep EEG because of bilaterally present epileptiform discharges.  This recording does may (sic) indicate a lower seizure threshold""  2nd she NEVER had a seizure.  She was put on Keppra 750mg at night.

My mother sees a PCP and 11 specialists; cognitively she's fine but has a couple of medical conditions that require specialist care. Not sure if it's better medical care or a reduction in stress from dad's issues being out in the open but she's in better shape than she was a year ago. WShe may be released from care of two of the doctors if her vasculitis and autoimmune hepatitis remain resolved.  Dad has dementia (83 stage 5-6ish) and a much smaller team; our goal for dad is freedom from pain and best quality of life with the least amount of making him uncomfortable. He's pretty happy to go along to the appointments because he seems to understand we care about his well being. He has breathing issues (COPD sleep apnea and pulmonary fibrosis) and a recurrence of prostate cancer which is being treated to avoid it moving into his bones.   For the last 6 or 8 months my dad has been complaining about having pain in his upper belly. Just last week he was telling his urologist about how he thinks his ribs are broken because of the pain. His pulmonologist ordered a CT Scan to get a baseline for the condition of his lungs.

Not sure how long this will be true.  My husband has also confessed that he does not want to take on the responsibility of having to maintain moms house.  Having her with us is already a lot of work.  I guess I'm inclined to agree that selling seems to be the best choice.  Mom is understanding when it comes to the sale of her house.  The house is part of a family trust that she set up 3 years ago.  I assume the proceeds from the sale will be put back into the trust/or remain in the trust as cash vs property?? Still not sure if selling is best for moms long term finances.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  (I did search the message board and didn't find what I am looking for.  I also searched for elder lawyers and will be researching a few alternatives.),False,cmf13,2017-07-10,30.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147535361,,,AlzConnected,,,

The staff were great at first: frequent nurse visits social work intake chaplain visits supplies...but since then I feel as though I am pulling teeth. For months her nurse has been telling me that she will likely lose hospice services--she has based this on the single parameter of arm circumference as a proxy for weight. I have documented the many cognitive and functional changes I have seen and have succeeded in getting her recertified. The NP was very reasonable listened to my concerns and agreed that she continues to meet criteria.    Today Mom had a nurse visit; the nurse called me at my request and told me how great Mom looks but mentioned she was surprised and concerned that she  was in bed. She told me that being in bed puts her at risk for a bedsore.  My mother once put in her chair does not move at all not even to shift her buttocks. She is incontinent of urine and stool. Moving her requires the Hoyer lift (per assessment of the PT) as she is completely non-weight bearing. She gets very frightened when being moved and complains of pain. The alternatives are:  1. Leave her sitting in a chair for the whole day with a wet diaper and pad (the aide's preference as this requires less effort)   2. Put her in the chair then transfer 2-3 times a day chair-Hoyer-wheelchair-Hoyer-bed to be changed then bed-Hoyer-wheelchair-Hoyer-chair...by the end of just one leg of this journey she and her caregiver (often me) are exhausted.   3. Sit her in chair for a few hours then to bed for changing rest pressure relief and repositioning then back to chair for awhile as tolerated.  (This was PT's recommendation.)  Call me crazy but I think option 3 is the best. Last I checked the physiology of decubitus ulcers is tissue compression from immobility exacerbated by the acidic effects of urine and stool on the skin. Repositioning someone every 2-3 hours is supposed to prevent these complications.  Anyway I feel as though this nurse who has spent approximately 30 minutes with my mother in the last 3-4 months is condemning me for poor care. I feel as though she thinks I am lying when I describe my mother screaming in pain when we try to gently turn her to clean her as she said she doesn't see any indications of pain.   The hospice visits are short visits during the afternoon when Mom has been washed dressed groomed and is usually sitting up. They do not ever witness her being transferred washed or dressed. She has never had a full skin assessment.   Honestly I feel as though as an elderly person dying a slow death from advanced dementia they find her uninteresting. I am sorry that it is not the heartbreaking drama of the young person dying from cancer but I don't think that makes her less worthy of care. I think at times they are clueless...one of them asked me about eye doctor visits. My mother is completely housebound; the only option for taking her somewhere would be an ambulance and a stretcher; she cannot even sit up in a wheelchair for any length of time. WTH do they think she is doing when they are not there...taking laps around the house?  I thought hospice was supposed to be a benefit and that I would have kind knowledgeable people helping me with Mom's care.  Instead I feel like I am begging for scraps from the table and that I am on the verge of being accused of elder neglect.   Sorry for the whining feeling a little discouraged.,False,Iamnumberfour,2016-02-29,1265.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147535984,,,AlzConnected,,,

521,621050907b65de9a5b661fc4,2147535369,2017-07-20 18:36:00,My Day with Mom. Sorry so long but it means a lot to me.,Sorry so long again. I enjoy being able to reflect on my time with my mom  and put it into words and it is my hopes that somewhere in all the mumble jumble I write it helps at least one person who is also struggling.   Drove down and spent another day with my mom today. Looks like I'm back to going there 4 or 5 days out of the week but that's okay. As long as my dad continues to show some respect and communicate better with me and my brother stays out of the way and is not a continued obstacle to the care I give my mom I am not at all opposed to being with her.. I love being with my mom! Always have always will.  When we went for breakfast she seemed to be more distant than usual just starring a lot and not saying much. I know eventually most people with dementia/Alzheimer's become like this where they do not speak or look at you and just sit in silence. However my mom is not at that point yet she is not that advanced yet. I later found out from my dad that she started the second week in the Namenda starter kit when the frequency is increased to morning and night. Could it have been the increase in medication that made her like this this morning? Has anyone ever had this problem with this medication? I know it is still new and she's just starting on it so we will continue to give it and just monitor her closely. I just don't want her on something that is going to make her like a lump on a log so to speak. I would almost rather her be hyper and agitated than mute and seeming lifeless does that make sense?  I was able to finally get her in the shower again thank God. After unsuccessful attempts on my part 2 days ago and my dad and brother were unable to get her in last night as well. It took a while but I was very patient and persistent. I turned off the air conditioner in the house put on her favorite song in the bathroom and ran the hot water for a bit before trying to get her in and after several failed attempts she finally took that step over the ledge and into the tub. I always point the shower head at the tile wall and after she gets in she adjusts it on her own. This time around I realized she did not pay attention to the labels on the bottles (shampoo conditioner body wash etc.) which she has always looked at in the past. So soon as she got in she put conditioner on her washcloth to wash her body with. I let her be but while she wasn't looking I grabbed the bath sponge put body wash on it lathered it up and asked if I could wash her back for her she always loves that then I handed it to her and she proceeded to wash the rest of her body. When she finished in the shower she let me blow dry and curl her hair (always having to take at least 2 breaks because she can't seem to sit still long enough to finish in one sitting).  Later we drove and met up with my dad and when we finished I got my mom in the car with him said goodbye then began my drive back home. As I was driving (a 45 minute drive) I started bawling the car. That wave of sadness I felt the other night was back again and I couldn't seem to stop. Mid cry my phone rings and it's my mom (she has an icon on her cell phone she taps and it calls me). She too was crying and told me she misses me and I am welcome to come back to her house tomorrow or any day I want. Sometimes she surprises me when she says things like this because a lot of times she cannot even seem to find all the right words to finish a thought or sentence. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart and thanked her for always being so sweet and kind to me.   Thank you Lord for the gifts You give us and for helping us recognize the little things in the midst of the pain and sadness that weigh so heavily on our hearts.,False,MRY4Mom,2014-01-12,394.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147535369,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is now 75 and the decline has been very very gradual. My husband and I care for her at home.  I would say she was at stage 5ish in April of this year. Not very verbal but able to feed herself dress herself if given her clothing one item at a time attending and loving an adult daycare and walking unassisted with a walker. She still originated and got up and down by herself often. She stood in the shower and let me wash her daily. She has been incontinent for some time now.  May brought a UTI and a course of antibiotics which didn't fully work because June was filled with a more severe UTI 4 days in the hospital 20 days in Rehab and then a discharge because she wasn't improving.  She was still behaving like she has a UTI: screaming anytime she is touched/ moved/ cleaned. Incapable of doing much of anything talking to people that aren't there dumping juice on her dinner plate putting water cap in her mouth etc.    We brought her home. We have medicare paid OT PT and nurses coming to the house. We are also getting hooked up with a home visit Dr.   Once home there was some improvement some walking and getting up unassisted (occasionally) for a few weeks. No origination and a lot of fear still. Neurologist put her on Seraquil. I couldn't really tell much of a difference.   And then last week a worsening: hallucinating inability to walk smelly urine sediment in urine. So back to the ER we went. The ER doc told me they didn't see ""much of infection"" but they still kept her for two days and did two bags of IV antibiotics.  While in the hospital she was completely wild: crazy screaming not eating much. Turns out they weren't giving her Seraquil.   Since home on Friday she is afraid crying and miserable. The Seraquil has helped some with her calm times but when she is touched to move or clean... pandemonium! She cannot walk she screams and fights she is not just deadweights but actually pushes against us when we are trying to transfer. It's completely untenable.  I still don't think she is better from the UTI but the hospital doesn't care. Of course I will be insisting the the home care nurse gives her another cath and culture.  But there is also a good chance that this is her new normal. She cries and begs up to leave her alone says things like ""I don't wanna do this anymore"" ""I can't"" She seems acutely aware that she is messed up and is (understandably) horrified by it. She calls out for help (for example if she is sliding down in her chair and needs to scoot back up) and then screams and pushes when anyone approaches to assist. We have tried every person every approach we are past the point where Teepa Snow methods can help. There is absolutely no circumstance under which she will submit to any hygiene or moving related actives. I can't even remember the last time she let me brush her teeth properly.  This morning my husband who's been risking his back deadlifting her could not get her showered and had to settle for a wipe down and a new diaper and clothing. He put her in a wheel chair and brought her to the living room. She ate breakfast and is now eating lunch as I sit with her. She will need to be changed soon but only he is strong enough to lift her.   We are thinking that it might be time to switch to comfort care. She is most upset by being made to do things she is clearly no long able to do. We think we need to adapt her care plan to her current abilities.    But is this giving up on her? And comfort care brings new problems too:  Skin integrity issues are my main fear especially because she won't let anyone cleanse her properly. She's pretty strong and if she won't open her legs I can't get in there to clean and inspect.  How the hell am I supposed to keep her clean? Hold her down and force the issue? We cared for his father when he was bed bound so we know how to do all of this but his Dad was of sound mind and willingly rolled and moved.   Also the less she moves the stiffer and more painful moving becomes. I see some joint locking just from her last stint in the hospital. I plan to ask PT to concentrate on keeping her joints moving even if she can't/won't walk. She can walk physically speaking but that doesn't much matter if she is too afraid to try.  Pain: She used just react to moving her ""bad leg"" (not really bad repaired but in her mind...) now it's both. I still was unconvinced that there was genuine pain I thought she was just upset about being touched until I saw her call out when moving her legs on her own off the bed onto the floor. So if she's in pain... particularly if the pain is result of not moving... how can we help?   She experiences some relief for the Seraquil... would more help with the agitation during hygiene? I guess if I have to choose between catatonic and punching me in the face I would choose catatonic.   When left to sit or lay she is mostly calm but falls asleep and wakes up screaming. We try to reassure her but it's clear she cannot understand a word we say. Hand motions are mostly not working either. She is so sad and so afraid.   We are reading the signs and making arrangements to sell her home to liquify her money to spend on additional help OR facility care... whatever is necessary. We will move her and us back to our house which we have been AirBnBing while living in hers.  I worry that the move will be tough on her but her bedroom is painted the same color we've lived there with her before and there really isn't a choice.   Once her house is sold money will not be an issue for whatever she needs. It's tempting to throw in the towel and put her in a home... if she is going to be afraid and miserable either way... why are we doing this to ourselves? But she still lights up sometimes when her son walks in the room and with a new care plan and more home health aides we could provide a loving place to spend her last years like we always intended... I think?  I've read the threads about end stages and she is checking a lot of those boxes but on the other hand she is 75 still eats ok and is relatively healthy. Is that were we are now? Is this normal? Is she dying? Is it time for comfort care?",False,DeepDish,2016-01-03,54.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147535566,,,AlzConnected,,,

Why is a full neuro workup important?  If it's clear from the information on stages and behaviors that I have documented plus an internist's assessment of ALZ what can a neuro workup tell me and future medical professionals that would change anything about the treatment during continued progression?  2. Do NH's or MC's require this workup before admission?  3. If a PCP is not referring us to a neurologist or neuro/phych or geri/psych doctor how much do I push?  I love this doctor she's kind and easy to work with.  She seems to truly care about LO.  But she wants to manage everything about LO's care.  With insurance and LO's trust issues changing doctors is a huge pain.  This is the first doctor LO has listened to in over 4 decades.  And the first one who has truly listened to me.  4. LO has long history of untreated (mildish) schizophrenia.  For the last 20 years she has been highly functional lived alone and caused no problems.  What is the best type of doctor to see for a complete workup?  She's on Seroquel for ""agitation"" based on here current ALZ diagnosis.  It's working pretty well - better than I expected.  I don't want LO's last years to be full of psych drugs when she's been against them her whole life.

Last week he became verbally abusive to another resident and now the facility wants to move him to another facility that is more secure.

He told me that:    1) I was rewarding her ""bad behaviour"" by going to see her and all she had to do is act up for me to come.   2) Her restless and combativeness was my fault because I visit too much and that I should limit my visits to once a week maximum.  I visit her about 3-4 times a week after work on the weekdays and take her out once on the weekends.  My brother lives about 10 minutes away from Mom and maybe visits once a month.  I don't put any expectations on him to visit him but advise when I arrange any family visits with our out-of-town brother and his family which he comes to.  In our argument he suggested that if I limit my visits to once a week that he would visit her once a week as well.  I told him that I was uncomfortable with that and suggested that we talk to someone who is familiar with Alzheimer's like the AL's Director of Care or our family doctor.  He was uncomfortable with that as he felt they would tell me I'm wrong and I would be angry at him.  Talked to Mom's doctor and he said that 3 times a week is more than enough.  My brother is the only close relative in town with Mom and I since we moved her from our hometown 4 hours away.   I called him a week later and he brought up a minor fender bender that occurred a month and a half ago.  Mom was in the car with me at the time.  He feels that Mom was traumatized and caused the restlessness and combativeness. Again it's my fault that I had her out in the car.    Told him that Mom was fine and the doctor is changing her meds to Seroquel which has helped Mom.    Haven't heard from him since and don't want to call due to his negativity.       I'm angry and very frustrated with him.  The stress he adds to the pain of watching our Mom progress further is difficult to deal with. I feel that my support is being pulled out from under me.

Well an hour or so later my brother calls wanting to know what my mother had called me for.... she had been in the hospital the week prior and apparently the docs there had required that a home health nurse visit the home.  My guess is that my mom had bruises or said something to them to make them suspect abuse or neglect.  According to my brother the nurse had told him that my mother called me.  Ok...well during that conversation my brother related how downhill my mother was going and how abusing she was being to them.  Screaming at them and whatnot.  And that my SIL had researched how to counter that...by having a neighbor call the PD and having her committed for a psych eval.  Well low and behold the very next day he sends a text to us all saying that the exact scenario my SIL had researched had come to be the night before.  So now my mom sits in a very poorly reviewed nursing home undergoing a psych evaluation.  Aside from the sibling issues -- my sisters and I are not speaking.  I *was* on good terms with this brother but after this probably not.  Anyway aside from those issues they have all agreed that our mother should live with me because I have room in my house and I am not working outside the home.  I have the time to give to my mother which my SIL(due to her own health issues) was not able to do.   So that's where we are at right now.  My mother is in phoenix and I'm calling her everyday.  She is furious with my brother and goes on long rants about him and ""that wife of his"" and about how he doesn't love her anymore and wants nothing to do with her.  My sister has arranged a conference call between all of us for this Sunday to discuss my taking over medical POA and moving my mother up here when she is released from the nursing home.  My sister has told me that should be June 17th.  I plan to be down there by that time.  So.... I'm terrified confident happy and sad all at once.  I've wanted my mother to live with me ever since my dad died.  I was her last choice.  So there is that sadness as well to know that I am a last resort.  I'm terrified though that I won't be able to take care of her.  I have a 3 story house with bedrooms on the top and bottom floors so there are stairs involved.  I keep envisioning her falling down the stairs in the middle of the night.  I'm confident though that I can help her far more than my brother could since he was not with her for most of the time being at work.  My SIL never sat with my mom to DO anything just left her to her own devices.  I'm pretty sure that I can do well in that regard.  And being a retired nurse I think I can handle the meds well and doctor visits and maybe get a handle on what's happening.    At the moment all I've gotten is second hand reports from my brother.  I did go to one ""pain management"" doctor visit and was appalled at how they treated my mom.  The doc did not talk to her but to my brother and actually talked about how demented people did this or that... right in front of my mother who look about ready to tear the woman apart.  They tell me that she was the best of who would accept my mother's insurance.  Ack!!!  So my question to all of you is.... is it wrong of me to want to start from square one?  IE have her seen by a neurologist up here and confirm the diagnosis?  From what I can tell she was just told by her doctor in Washington that she had ALZ and that was that...she definitely had it.  No question about what else her cognitive decline might be due to.  So can I start again or is it too late?",False,StarEcho,2017-06-08,159.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534466,,,AlzConnected,,,

Okay I understand my mom is difficult but it seems those aides just like to rush through - which in fact they said they were rushing because my mom was combative and acted like she had pain.  I spoke with both supervisors and I'm trying not to overreact because it wasn't intended to hurt her.  Of course the psych nurse said maybe we'll give Seroquel twice a day - which I told her will only make my mother sleep and we want her to get out of bed.  The Director of the memory care unit also listened and agreed with me and said the aides need another work-around   - I should add yesterday they didn;t change her pads at all until evening when my sister got there because she refused.  I told all in charge that they are to call me on the days she is not cooperative and I can come earlier to see if I can help.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having her in a place.  This has always  been the problem - my mother will only be slightly more cooperative with family members.

She is probably has stage 6 alzheimers she is having issues with bowel adhesions which cause her pain.  I took her to the ER last week because of this since the doctor she sees at her MC facility didn't think he could do anything for her since she refuses medications.  At the ER they used a catheter to get a urine sample which she hated and she had a CT scan (during which she complained loudly and seemed afraid of the machine).  They gave her some antibiotics through the IV for a slight UTI and diagnosed the adhesions for which there is no solution except surgery.  But she kept wanting to leave and get out of bed and I was afraid she would pull out the IV.  I don't think surgery would be an option for her...they would have to tie her to the bed to keep her from harming herself.   She has lost 10 lbs in 3 months... the doctor says if she keeps going like this we should call hospice.  I agree since I don't think she would tolerate any kind of medical intervention.  But it's so hard to watch...I want to help her I want her to feel better.  But I don't know that she would tolerate having teeth pulled.  She asked for and took a tylonel for pain which was a surprise since she usually refuses that.  I feel guilty that I haven't forced her to go to the dentist.  She's not ready for hospice yet....but how do you go about waiting until they are ready when there is nothing you can do to help them.,False,tangocastillo,2015-09-02,103.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534534,,,AlzConnected,,,

The infection required several trips to dentist and oral surgeon. I was not going to allow her to have surgery of any sort and thankfully an antibiotic cleared the infection. I discussed the importance of removing the partial nightly per the written instructions of the dentist to the wellness director of AL. All seemed well for a few weeks until I was out to lunch with Mom and noticed she had difficulty eating. I removed her partial which was difficult and she had pain when I probed her gums with her toothbrush. Back to dentist and another consult with wellness director and I'm feeling confident the matter is being handled. I miss a couple of weeks visiting Mom and our other caregiver visited her but I did not ask her to check dental partial. Mom probably would not have let her anyway. So I'm with Mom this week and ask her to remove dental partial. She could not remove it easily and had to force it and deal with pain. I removed partial from her room and placed it on director's desk with instructions to leave it out until I can decide how to handle this. My decision is to leave the dental partial out to prevent another infections. The first infection was determined by a home health nurse. Mom's jaw had a swollen and red knot on the exterior of her face but AL staff did not notice it or alert me of it. I'm most likely going to leave the partial out and have Mom served soft meals.   Have any of you had this problem? Even if we paid for the highest level of care I'm not sure I can expect the dental partial to be handled as necessary. I welcome your comments.

No response. Kept calling until 5am at which point hospice told memory care to call 911.    So our first notification was a call from a strange ER Monday morning (memorial day) saying they had my FIL.  Ummmm WHAT?  Hospice you had ONE JOB - to keep him out of the hospital (four traumatic hospitalizations this year totalling six weeks).    Good news - they were very caring and responsive when we said no interventions. Put him in a room we got my MIL and we all got to spend time with him where thanks to morphine drip he was non-agitated and calm.   Hospice nurse showed up and said she didn't think anything would happen Mon or Tues.  So after 7 hours or so we take my MIL back to AL we go home with the plan to pace ourselves.   Get a call two hours later saying his vital signs were sinking fast - my husband and I head over sit with him for 20 minutes or so and he took a breath and... just never took the next one.  My husband and I looked at each other like... was that it?  It was way more peaceful than we thought it would be and mercifully short. We were honestly a little surprised. Hospital staff was caring and supportive.   And that's it.   Lessons learned:   dayn2nite - ugh i remembered your awful hospice story more than once.  this was obviously a case of holiday short staffing and we are still a little like... hospice told you to call 911?? is that a joke?   I guess hospice can be ok but our experience was pretty terrible and they ended up taking more time to coordinate than we wanted with undesired outcome.  We would have done better on our own.   That being said you just have to kind of go with it. For us the hospital experience wasn't a bad one the morphine drip smoothed out his agitation enough that we were certain he wasn't in pain the staff was very caring and understood what we wanted and made that happen.    We were happy it was over he is free from the pain agitation worry that characterized this disease for my FIL.  We were glad it was quick - not overall but in terms of that day - and we had some time with him but it didn't drag on for too long with the unending stream of difficult decisions.   Of course we did not escape the day without the predicted bout of family drama - but we emerged unscathed made the arrangements w the mortuary and got out of there before the crazy arrived. Another lesson learned - I have no time for nonsense. If you're not helping get out of the way.   Its been an intense year - and I think we're still a little stunned.  I feel for you all who are caring for your loved ones with dementia.  It's definitely changed me as a person - I feel like I look at many things differently now.  I think when you're involved in the day to day progression and decision-making it can't NOT change you.  Bless you all.  I will never meet someone with a LO with this awful disease and not feel a kinship.    Rebecca   RIP James E Wilhelm 5-29-2017",False,rebecca2000,2016-09-25,321.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534270,,,AlzConnected,,,

I've had so many phone calls and emails from all kinds of people whose lives she has touched telling me their remembrances of her or asking for the information about the services.  I told our brother to be prepared because there are a lot of people coming just for Deb.  Her dentist who custom-made her dentures several several years ago &amp; his wife told me they would be there.  The owners of the Residential Care Facility where she lived before she went in skilled nursing are not only going to be there but the man is going to be a pallbearer.  Her friends from the Residential Care Facility are coming.  People from the sheltered workshop where she has been gone from for at least the last 10 years because of her health - but where she worked for 26 years - are coming.  All four of her regular nurses from the nursing home &amp; other staff members are coming.  The hair stylist from the beauty salon at the nursing home requested to do her hair for the last time.  The funeral home agreed to that request.  Deb loved getting her hair done &amp; went to the beauty shop there every Wednesday health permitting.  I've been an investigative analyst in Federal law enforcement for many years of my life.  My old boss who has since relocated out of state contacted me just to let me know his feelings about Deb - how deeply she impacted his life &amp; made him a better person brought me to tears.  My God the place will be filled with people who all loved her.  The outpour of constant messages and phone calls has been - to say the least - overwhelming.  I'm trying so hard to pull myself together for these last two days with her.  I knew this would be hard but I never dreamed the pain in my heart would be this deep.  I know.  Silly me.  My husband's life and mine have totally revolved around her for 14 years.  The other night we went into a little local restaurant for dinner.  For the first time I didn't have to sit my cell phone on the table in case I'd get a call about her.  We're trying to figure out a new ""normal"" for our lives.  It's all so surreal right now.  Those of you who have gotten through this time have my complete &amp; total respect.  I'm just not sure how I'm going to get through these last 2 days to give her the most beautiful send-off possible.  My God I miss her so much already.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147534086,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am currently staying with my grandma who has Alzhiemer's.  I am not sure when she was diagnosed exactly but I know it has been at least 6 years.     In the last few months I've noticed her eating and sleeping habits have been getting worse.  She wants to nap on and off throughout the day while I'm working from home. At night she suffers from the common Sundowners issues that I have read about on many of the Alz websites. She gets nausea but actually doesn't throw anything up gets dizzy and can hardly sleep. Is there anything I can do? I hate to see her in pain and only want to provide comfort.  Has anyone had to deal with this sort of thing at night? Her doctor is really no help only states this is typical and something that will happen due to the Alz. Family that is in town is really no help.  I stay up all night to help her and make her realize she isn't home alone.     Sorry for the long post just looking for help.,False,ladymuscan,2014-11-04,9.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147510625,,,AlzConnected,,,

So alittle background they are all asleep right now so I will have to update later on but I'm really desperate for a solution.  Her mom has had Alzheimer's at a very early age I think around 60 and its prob been more than 15 years since the first signs of Alzheimer's.  There seems to have been a couple of different stages during the years but at this point she was able to walk and answer simple questions and do potty with her husbands assistance without any problem and eat her favorite things.  But all of a sudden on April 1st 2017 she couldn't raise her head up and wouldn't respond when talked to and will not potty.  She can't lift her head up and if forced to she would scream in pain but if you are able to lay her on the bed the head will actually straighten without a problem. it doesn't seem like she can't lift her head up as she will lift it up like nothing happened randomly like for a split second in the whole day.  Since her head is looking straight down she can't see where she's going and will hit the wall or door and bulldoze everything in her way. She needs to be walked with both hand but when she refuses to follow she has the power to throw me to the ground.  The main problem is that she has become very very anxious and would refuse to sit down and rest even though we walk her around the house literally all day from 2am when she wakes up till 10 pm. She will be sweating like crazy from wrestling with us all day but will not sit on the chair and even if we are able to convince her to sit down and rest she will stand right back up and pull us wherever.  She will say she needs to pee or pop ASAP and once we take her to the bathroom she will refuse to sit or take her pants off and will push or pull herself and the caregiver with superhuman strength out of the bathroom and continue to walk us around endlessly around the house saying she needs to go pee or poo or go home.  Also she will refuse to let go of her hands and grab on so tight that it bruses the caregivers arm and hands.  So basically it's the circle of walking her to the bathroom and living back and forth for 20hours.   The only time she ever pees or poo is at 2am on the bed as she wakes up and it's a great mess.,False,Bk888,2017-04-20,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147533454,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom went onto hospice care back in the fall after a couple of vascular events. At the time it seemed as though she wouldn't last out the month but she bounced back to some degree and is still with us although greatly declined. She is completely nonambulatory double-incontinent and unable to perform any self care. She cannot wash dress herself or brush her teeth. She can usually feed herself although there are days when she can't and she usually has a good appetite. Indeed I think she eats more than I do and unfortunately weight gain may disqualify her from hospice. Mom is verbal but not oriented. Her speech is hard to follow as it is mostly indefinite articles and random words or phrases based on whatever is in her field of vision or what is on the television with little coherent narrative. She can usually identify me but will use my name for the hired caregivers. She often speaks of outings with her sister who died years ago.   Moving her around to get her washed dressed and out of bed is a huge chore as she is about 130 pounds of not just dead weight but resistant dead weight. I can lift and pivot 130# but when she is trying with all her might to fling herself on the ground it is difficult. She screams curses and accuses me of trying to hurt her and ""throw her on the floor."" I have spoken with the hospice team about pain; the nurse is convinced that it is fear not pain. I disagree. Mom has significant arthritis and a broken arm that is probably only poorly healed.    Mom's day consists largely of watching TV. She can't read books anymore. She used to enjoy the newspaper even if just paging through it as an old habit; now it just seems to agitate her. She never did any crafts; even if this were something she liked to do she no longer has the motor skills. I bought her a fidget blanket; she just seems to find it an irritant. She occasionally gets some pleasure from holding a baby doll for short periods. Taking her outside in the wheelchair is very distressing; she screams cries out in fear/pain when taken down the threshold ramp (let alone the stair ramp) and shakes uncontrollably. I don't think the pay-off of fresh air is worth it. She would not be able to participate in an adult day program. There are few or no resources for socialization in the home.  Her friends have mostly died or disappeared.     We have live-in care which costs a lot and the usual family dynamics of involved adult children adult children who have checked out and sibling infighting. I am concerned that her increasing disability will sooner rather than later make her too difficult for one aide to manage. As it is I feel as though there is a significant risk of injury to her or to a caregiver. I live and work in a different state and spend a lot of my free time traveling to Mom's.  I am physically exhausted from working traveling to Mom's and the sheer physical demsnds of getting her cleaned and cared for. I do all of the shopping as my siblings refuse to do so; as well they refuse to provide meals leaving meal preparation to the hired caretakers. It is mentally and emotionally exhausting as well. An afternoon of sitting with Mom and trying to follow her conversation is mind-numbing and if I walk out of the room she gets anxious and calls out for me. And just when I think she is totally unconnected she coherently speaks of feeling lonely. Watching this slow death is like watching the lights go out one by one.

Dad died in August and since that time Mom with AD has gained a few pounds is more interested in her hygiene and appearance which is still not fabulous but better.  Mom  was so anxious and mean when Dad was dying.  My husband and I moved into my parents home to care for them so they could stay in the comfort of their home and familiar surroundings. I have finally gotten over feeling like people would think I was mooching ( I have a brother who did that many times over the years until he and his wife stole over $500 from my mother's bank account which overdrew it.)  I have even fallen into a semi-comfortable rhythm with Mom we added a ROKU to her television in the front living room where she spends most of her time.  She can watch or listen to episodes of old shows like Dick Van Dyke without too much concern over the remote since episodes keep running for awhile.  She isn't mean or argumentative in the last two months. She can't seem to hold a thought together long enough to gripe or criticize.  She seems to have forgotten things and people that caused her to be anxious and irritable too. She only talks about who is right in front of her or is here frequently.   Recently Mom has stopped trying to do chores she was doing after Dad died.  She is down to washing some dishes (which takes her most of the day and would take the average adult 15 minutes).  This makes her happy and occupied.  I have noticed that I am doing more and more of the dishes finishing what she starts re-doing what she did incorrectly.  Day before yesterday she put a sweater and pants in the washing machine and remembered soap but that is as far as she got.  She is spending more time walking outside and enjoying the yard.  My husband and I have spent countless hours with my teenage son transforming almost three acres into a lush sanctuary.  Mom loves plants and flowers so did Dad as well as feeding birds and squirrels.  We did all the gardens and flowerbeds for her as well as ourselves and I'm glad she is loving them and finally getting regular sunshine.    While doing some painting with my son on the out-buildings (I hired my nephew to do it because of my physical limitations but he got paid and left half the work unfinished) I hurt my back and ended up laying on alternating heat and ice and taking prescriptions for 2 days.  I was able to come out of my room and putter around after a couple days but on day two Mom came to my room at 3 a.m. and asked me if I had her baby.  This has happened in the past and mom was prescribed anxiety meds which worked wonders.  I think my inactivity and obvious pain is freaking mom out and every morning she gets up asking me where her baby is.  It's been about 8 days since I hurt my back and for 5 of those days she has been waking at odd hours like 1 a.m. 3 today 5:30 a.m. and she eats and asks me about her baby.  When I explain her kids are grown it takes a few minutes and she tells me she has been taking care of a baby and it seems so real to her.  She asks why she is so ""crazy"".  Night before last I dreamt Mom was standing in the front door eyes wide having tremors.  She was pale and called out my name in a panic.  She stood there with a blank stare and her mouth open like my dad looked when he was on his death bed.  I woke up screaming.  Since then I have had the thought ""what will I do when she is at the end"".  I cared for my dad physically (I got certified as a CNA in 2012 so I could care for my parents when the time came) and now over 7 months after his death some of the mental images still come to mind.  I worry that Mom's physical care will become an issue sooner rather than later and I'm a little scared that it will leave a mark on me the way caring for Dad did.

As caregivers we deal withpain every day and often it's our own. We get so caught up withtrying to help our loved one that we lose sight of our own needs.   One of those needs ( for meat least ) is to remember the beauty in the world around me. Toremember the wondrous creations of our God.  To remember that  He isin control.

She has a body alarm so if she gets out of the recliner or wheelchair everyone will know.  However she is STILL trying to walk on it which is causing it to still remain swollen &amp; can't have surgery yet.   Does anyone have any experience with successful treatments or meds or anything that might help or make it register that if she doesn't stop walking on a swollen broken ankle that she will damage it beyond repair and the alternatives to that suck.,False,2Aussies,2016-09-04,13.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147533226,,,AlzConnected,,,

My dad is able to manage his day to day living right now-no burners left on he can cook clean drive etc.  He just has an insistence that someone is breaking into his home every night to smoke pot drink his coffee and generally be a pain in the patoot.  Dad is not afraid just ticked that his measures (deadbolts alarms) aren't keeping the intruder out.  I am the only local child 20 minutes away versus 300 and 600 miles so I am the assistance giver and sounding board for him.

Second so mom got diagnosed with stomach cancer and two suspicious spots one on each lung back in Dec.  After much painful thought and discussion we decided not to do any treatment.  So the oncologist who supported and actually somewhat encouraged our decision has said just call if you need anything. Ok fine.  But now what's happening is....well nothing.  She seems to be exactly the same as before.  I feel like I want or need to know what the cancer is doing is it progressing has it spread are the spots on her lungs cancer??? I am tortured with these questions even if I know we would not treat them.  Then she fell down and broke her wrist!  The doctor said the only perfect cure for that was surgery but he said he would not recommend that for her.  We have been in a full past the elbow cast and now to a cast to her forearm.  She complains of pain picks at the cast stuffs Kleenex or cotton down in it...... she now cannot dress at all.  She is totally reliant on a walker but they don't want her to put pressure on her hand.  I am trying to manage her pain by alternating small doses of the pain meds with regular Tylenol.  I haven't yet found the right combo to keep her totally comfortable yet not out of it.  Her new neuro tests came back and said her vocabulary scored high and her memory processing ability to make decisions processing all scored very low.  initially they told me Alzheimer's 4 years ago even though she was diagnosed by the family doc and has been on meds 12 years now but now they say due to her high vocabulary they will say dementia.  She may have all of her words for now but she sure as heck doesn't know what day year month it is.  And the thing is I just feel like I am on my own here.  The doctors are all very nice but I need concrete suggestions for stuff.  I mean maybe this is just the way it is.  One of my elder caregivers mother was just diagnosed with lung cancer and she is 86 and will not accept treatment but her doctors are doing a PET scan and giving them lots of info.  I just feel like I don't know what's next.  I feel like someone handed me a ticking bomb and said ok hold this.  It will explode at some point but we don't know when.  But just go about your life and keep holding it knowing it will explode.  I guess I don't even know what my question is....just upset.

Her behaviours are such that she has been discharged from 2 adult day care facilities. She was only going 2 days a week.Not sure what to do yet as I am her only caregiver and she does not qualify medicaid.  I also feel she has not been properly diagnosed. Her behavior is odd even for dementia.   The other issue is that I am emotionally tied to my mom. I am an only child and my mom and I were buddies all of my life.

My mother has been showing signs of confusion for some time.  Initially I thought it was a medication issue took them over got her off one med and she's shown improvement.  I've not had her diagnosed although I brought it up to her G.P. who did the three question test which they all seem to do.  Just over a month ago she took a fall in a store and was helped up (she's fallen twice before that I know of).  A week later we found her down called EMS and they took her to the ER.  She had a compression fracture and was released from the hospital after she got on a walker and almost ran around the ER.  Ironically my back blew out just after EMS wheeled her out.  So when she came home my father (her ex) took care of her for awhile.  A week ago she was down again said she didn't fall.  The next day when I came by to help get her out of bed she screamed in pain.  So off to the ER again.  This time they didn't release her and kept her.  She apparently had more damage than they discovered the first time.  She had difficulty with bowel movements and at one point screams at me to get her to the bathroom I did and she fell again off the toilet seat (the next day I stopped her from getting up and she went in the chair).  She wound up with a full-time nurse watching over her.  I spent a lot of time with her in the hospital.  She was very confused about where she was but she can be very cogent as well and she understands a fair amount.  The night before she was transferred I was talking with her into the early evening seemed really lucid when she thought I was my father (she did that twice but once it was on a narcotic for the pain).  She's was very confused about where she was when she was leaving and she tried to leave on her own (I guess walk out).  Her care records include the words dementia senile debility and I'm fairly comfortable that there's more in there than what I've been given.  She's been transferred to a physical rehab facility where she called my father completely confused about where she was.  I called her talked her down so to speak with more than a few alterations of the truth.  She's been a very hard patient because she keeps trying to get up and walk around.  Apparently she also declined a psych evaluation as she's still able to make her medical care decisions although I've been helping her and making them for her for the most part.  She will be medically evaluated on Monday and a care plan set up on Tuesday.  I don't see any way she can come home as she won't let someone into the house (hated my father being there) and she just keeps falling.  But she can't live alone because she doesn't eat well isn't caring for herself and a fall could kill her with the xarelto.  I've been talking to her about getting her an ""apartment"" so maybe she'll go along with things at least until she realizes where she's going.  Oh and she has a list of medical issues beyond this including diabetes blood pressure issues swollen feet osteoporosis and more.  A very stubborn strong and confused woman.  So to her medical POA.  It springs if a medical doctor I or my father declare her incapacitated.  In other words I can write words to the effect of ""so-and-so is incapacitated"" on a piece of paper and it is so.  I haven't done it because well she's mom and she can be really lucid and well I'd rather have a medical professional do it or try to convince her to do the right thing which she's mostly done when I've been around.  But I'm genuinely worried that she's making medical decisions that she can't really make.  I guess I just have to make it until Tuesday they have to already know this but I sit her worried that she might try to check herself out or something.

They mean more than you will ever know.    I've decided that I've worried my self to the point of not having an appetite (I've lost 13 lbs in 3 weeks) barely sleeping (I've taken a sleeping pill for years)     I'm done trying to get support from my brother/cousin. Don't need it don't care. My aunt asked me many years before she died to take care of my uncle so that's what I'm going to do. She obviously didn't ask anyone else but me so I'm thinking she knew I would step up/be strong enough and do this. No one (including cousin/brother) want to step up and do this so I will. I've asked them both in front of each other so there will be no misunderstanding later.    My uncle had a brief moment of clarity while at the Neurologist appt and said to me ""I love you and thank you for doing this"" there is my answer.    I don't care anymore that no one can understand/accept that my uncle is slowly losing the ability to make medical/financial decisions. I need to do this for him. My ""goal"" is to keep him safe and at home as long as he's able to.     At this point I will work with his Dr's to create a care plan. I'm not at this time going to live with him (he has his ""woman friend"" there now and she's absolutely NO help in taking care of him) Due to my own chronic pain issues (I had to medically retire from my job) I can not physically take care of my uncle. So I'll be taking the steps to get POA (with his Dr's/attorneys help) I'm going to find out if my uncle can get help through the VA to pay for home health I'm betting my uncle won't let them in the door (unfortunately there is no ""talking to him about this as he's stubborn) All can do is try.         I will make his app for MRI and let the office call him to remind him of this appointment same with his appointment for the Neuropsychologist. If he's non compliant I will then talk with his Dr's about applying for conservatorship (I have already contacted my legal insurance through my retirement benefits they will pay the cost for attorney to represent me in this)          I will also start researching for assistant living places in Las Vegas for him when the time comes he can no longer live at home safely (after I get conservativeship so I can access his insurance to see what they'll pay for as he has money house assets) I already know Medicare won't pay anything until all of his money is gone so if need be I'll get permission to sell his house (the woman friend will have to leave kills 2 birds with one stone as she's a thorn in my side) his car and whatever else needs to be sold so my uncle can live in the best place available to him as he deserves this and can afford it. I will spend every last dollar to make sure he is comfortable and safe!    Thanks again I actually feel so much better.

Just wait for them to come help you with your pajamas and medicine.  You can watch a show on TV. You’re home mom.  Everything is okay.”     No it is not. Not remotely okay. There is no home home and if home is the Self my mother has most certainly lost her way.  As Gertrude Stein once said of Oakland “There is no there there.”     I end the phone call and resume our couple’s therapy session.  My wife makes a joke that maybe my mother is in fact in the wrong apartment and I snap at her and tell her that isn’t funny. We snipe back and forth until the therapist asks “Who are you really angry at about your mother’s dementia?”     I take a moment.  “The universe?”    It’s a reasonable question but I don’t have a good answer.    I am angry.    Angry at this horrible disease that has progressively eclipsed my mother’s mind.       Angry that there remains nothing to do to stop or reverse what my mom and about 50 million other people worldwide suffer -- the memory loss confusion with time and place difficulty understanding spatial relationships and visual images problems with speaking reading and writing words poor judgment and decision making withdrawal from social activities the mood and personality changes depression fear and anxiety.     Dementia is like watching a solar eclipse with the moon completely blocking the sun.  For the purposes of this metaphor the moon is composed of deposits of plaques or the protein fragment beta amyloid and tangles or twisted strands of the protein tau.  These proteins damage nerve cells and murder the brain.  The sun is my formidable mother around whom like the earth we all orbited.    For the astronomically unenlightened a solar eclipse was regarded as a bad omen. The sun’s disappearance and the darkening of the sky in matter of minutes scared the daylights out of people. Instead of fear and sadness I am prone to anger as my world spins out of control.     So who am I really angry at?    Angry at my father for dying and leaving me the surrogate partner to deal with my mother’s decline a full-time and thankless job.     Angry at my older sister who with her studied Buddhist detachment stands at a distance unengaged except to encourage me to do all the work.     Angry at my younger sister for not standing up to my mother and now through no fault of her own is inaccurately deemed incapable of taking charge putting all the responsibility back on me the competent one.     Angry at my mother’s sister occupied with her Maj Jong and online card games who stopped showing up for my mom as the disease got too painful to watch.     Angry at my wife who does not seem to see me who does not soothe my pain.    Angry at my narcissist schizoid mother who requires me to be present and take care of her even though she did an inadequate job of mothering me.    “You should write about transitioning your mother from Assisted Living to Memory Care” the therapist suggests.  “A lot of people like you struggle with these issues.”    “What can I possibly tell them?” I counter. “It’s not that our journey has been exemplary.”  It has taken such a specific toll on all of us.     Earlier in the day I took my mom to her primary care doctor who needed to complete an assessment form so that I could proceed with moving my mother from her 1-bedroom apartment into a studio space in the 12-unit memory care space behind a locked door in the same Senior living facility.     When instructed to draw a clock my mother who once operated her own pharmacy business read voraciously invested in the stock market and prided herself on her fierce independence and command of all things practical with a very wobbly script added the numbers one and two at the top of the circle then placed three four and five in a little clump at the center. She looked at her work then announced “I think I flunked.”     “That’s okay mom.  If we had your crayons we could color it in and at least make a pretty picture” I offered.     The picture for many dementia patients is far from pretty.  My mother thanks to her financial acumen has had enough money to pay for the ridiculously expensive Senior living facility and services she has increasingly required.  However the costs not covered by Medicare are approaching $8000 a month and after three years we will have depleted her savings.  People with dementia often wind up overmedicated in skilled nursing facilities or vegetating in small group homes that professionals warned us away from.    We have struggled with the timing of when to move my mother.  When we took her to visit the “Connections” program a year ago she looked around at the small group of people seated at a large table about to play a game of Bingo and announced “I am not interested in being with a bunch of retards.”  Always blunt and brutally judgmental she saw herself as superior to the residents. “Pat” she ingratiated herself to my partner “Don’t let Sue put me here.”      We backed off and as the months passed I found myself having to take a half dozen anxious phone calls each day where often I had to reassure my mother and set her “right.” I’d say “Nothing is broken” even though she insisted “Everything is broken.”   She was right.  She was broken. Her brain was broken.     I made do being my mom’s executive function managing my mother’s activities with phone call reminders stepping up the Assisted Living services so that my mom was dressed bathed medicated checked for incontinence and reminded of meals each day.  I hired a caregiver to spend three afternoons a week with her my sister would see her on one weekend day and I would see her the other three days a week.      But as my mother’s mind deteriorated she grew increasingly unable to function not getting up from her overstuffed green swivel chair in front of the loud mind numbing TV blasting Rachel Ray and Judge Judy and the horrific news of the day.  In her massive confusion I was and continue to be her lifeline.  “Come get me now” she demands. “Come take me home.”     After turning down a spot in memory care two times the third time when a spot opened up I was unhesitant.  Here’s what I told my mom.     “Mom I know that you have not been happy.  You don’t know what to do with yourself and you spend too much time alone feeling scared and confused.  I think there is a good program for you where there will be kind people to help you whenever you need help and more things for you to do during the day.  We will still come to visit you and take you to the movies out-to-lunch and to my house.  But you need more help and people around you so you are not alone.”     Surprisingly she responded with four words “Sounds good to me.”     I used to think that dying was the quintessential experience of aloneness something that each of us must do by herself.  But dementia has preempted or eclipsed that final eclipse. She is alive but who is she?  She knows she is no longer herself and she is unable to reconcile her life because it has been stolen from her in broad daylight.      A total eclipse of the sun is seen if the Moon's inner or umbral shadow sweeps across Earth's surface. The track of the Moon's umbral shadow across Earth is called the  Path of Totality . It is about 10000 miles long but only about 100 miles wide and covers less than 1% of Earth's entire surface area. In order to see the Sun become completely eclipsed by the Moon you must be somewhere inside the narrow path of totality.     I am living inside that narrow path of totality as the trajectory of my mother’s dementia proceeds mercilessly. I am angry at the audacity of dementia.  My mother’s world is getting narrower and narrower with each passing day and on some days she still has the wherewithal to recognize this for a few moments.  I find myself in darkness grieving though she is stubbornly still here though not at home living in this umbral shadow.    It shatters my heart in  pieces like a billion stars.,False,suezemel,2017-03-21,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147532783,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'd love to say she spent her entire time on hospice in peace and comfort but like all things dementia is still alive well and kicking and confusing the actual 'active dying process'.  The last 8 hrs of her so called 'life' (that is a HOSTILE reference to dementia and not to to my Mom) I sat up with her while the continuous care nurse sat by her too.  The first 4 hrs were AWFUL.  I have sat/gone through end of life/hospice journey with multiple people and while none are alike I was in agony trying to figure out why shewas making this awful noise. The nurse and I talked about it possibly being the body restarting when breathing would slow we allowed for all the normal 'noise'/utterances.  After noise escalated and was more frequent despite her respiration rate I called crisis team and had them listen. The doctor and nurses thought it was more of a pain sound.  One of them actually said she sounded like she was in ANGUISH.  I thought I was going to lose it....they doubled certain meds we broke out Haldol and they rushed a nurse out on site. Finally after 4 hrs of the horrible noise she was quiet but breathing and her face relaxed.  Of course I beat myself up on both sides - for not easing her from possible pain earlier to wondering if it was somehow a 'natural' sound and while increase in meds didn't ostensibly killed her....did I just help euthanize her?  I still err on the side of having her peaceful.  I think if it had been 'too much' she wouldn't have lasted another 4 hrs or maybe this is wishful thinking.  A little after 7 am I was so exhausted from emotional distress that I went to bed. My Mom passed at 8:20 a.m.  I think she didn't want me there and as I've been with her every step of the way on this journey there was nothing left unsaid undone and I had been with her constantly and actually ensured I left for breaks in case she was waiting to be alone  Now as I try to write something about a woman who was one of the best people you could ever hope to meet but also my best friend..NOTHING is coming to mind/flowing.  Her funeral is Friday and I have yet to write a cohesive sentence!!

Tonight I'm in so much pain emotionally and I have no one to talk to. I apologize for what I labeled my subject I just didn't know what else to call it. I'll try to be as brief as I can. My Mom died from Alzheimer's in 2008 and my Dad because of his love for my Mom refused to put her in any type of facility and provided all of her care at the age of 77. He did a wonderful job. Then in 2014 my Dad was diagnosed with this same cruel disease. My one sister and I live in Pennsylvania nearly ten and a half hours away by car from my Dad's who lives in North Carolina. My other sister lives about a thirty minute drive from my Dad's and she early on she would provide all his care but because of the stage my Dad is in with the Alzheimer's he's become argumentative and combative. Saying and doing things he would never do otherwise. What is causing the unbelievable pain I'm in now is that my two sister's have sort of joined together and have said they both no longer cares what happens to my Dad. They seemed to have forgotten that my Dad's behavior is being controlled by the disease and that the things he says and does are not my real Dad. Months ago we all agreed that we would not take my Dad out of his home and put him in some type of facility but now they both say that they won't do anything to keep the Social Services people from coming and putting my Dad in their extremely dirty nursing home where all they do is to medicate their patients so they won't be a problem. My Dad does not deserve that!! My Dad has long periods of time where he is extremely lucid and is able to carry on a conversation and he seems like our old Dad and he's not at the point where he need's to be in a facility!! God I am in so much pain right now that I've even thought about taking my own life to spare me the horrific pain of knowing what happens to my Dad at the hands of my two sister's.  I know how drastic that sounds and it's not something I could actually do but when you're in so much pain you think about ways to get the pain to stop. Please can anyone give me any advice on how to make my sister's realize that my Dad's behavior is not his own any longer but belongs to the disease and to once again help and love him like they always have? I already suffer from depression and extreme loneliness because I have absolutely no friends I can turn to that are knowledgeable about this disease. I apologize for the length of my post but can anyone help me please?

So yesterday I decided to move her to MC.  The boyfriend spent all day yesterday telling her how awful I am how awful the move will be that she doesn't belong in MC etc etc.  When I arrived for dinner she was crying and said - do you know what they are doing to me tomorrow?  Also one of the boyfriend's cronies at the dining room table also launched a tirade against me saying that I am separating them unnecessarily that I made Mom cry etc etc.  I then took Mom aside talked to her about why this is necessary that she has been wandering and will now be safe that she will be with staff who are experts in dementia etc.  I got her calmed down and she eventually thanked me for taking care of her.  Meanwhile the boyfriend sat on her couch fuming.    I also took her to the MC wing of the AL and showed her her new apartment.  That is the part that killed me.  All of the residents seemed much worse than she is - she is still verbal and it did not seem that any of them are.  Sigh.  But Mom was chipper with them - she commented to several residents as we walked by ""you look as unhappy as I am"" - but with a smile.  There was a gentleman who looked at us blankly as we walked in - but she got a smile out of him as we left.  I think she may actually brighten the place up.  In my heart I know this is the right thing - but nothing in my life has been as tough emotionally.  Frankly I had hoped she would pass away before she needed memory care but her body and mind had other ideas.  So here we are.  Thanks for reading.  Cheers.",False,lccaredaughter,2017-02-03,172.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531952,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's almost been 2 years and has progressed in a downward spiral. He started at my house then moved to an assisted living and ended up in a nursing home. He is now on hospice.

We have endured occupational therapy physical therapy and speech therapy. He has had a cane walker wheelchair and now a high-back wheelchair. We've spent the night together in emergency rooms and hospital rooms. We've struggled with incontinence limited conversation and a frantic search when he got lost at the VA. We've been to neurologists nephrologists cardiologists podiatristsinternists and opthomologists. We sold his home and property to fund his care. We've been to attorneys banks and Medicaid specialists because he has now exhausted his funds. We've held hands shared hugs smiled cried laughed and spent time together without saying a word. I tell him that I love him and he smiles at me. Sometimes when I look into his eyes I see an empty stare. Other times I see a flicker of lucidity and I know he's my Daddy. He sleeps often and he seems to not be in pain. He is warm clean fed and properly medicated. He still loves Diet Coke. That is the only comfort that I have now. I'm feeling this intense sorrow and the tears are flowing tonight. I am physically feeling the effects of this grief and the pain of seeing him slowly deteriorate.  I don't know how much more we can endure. I pray that he passes peacefully while he sleeps.

My mom 88 was diagnosed with Alz about 14 years ago but hasn't shown any problems that anyone would notice until about 2 years ago.  She lives at a retirement community that provides 3 meals a day in their dinning room. First it's her right foot last year that hurt. So we went to the Dr. and got her a walker.  And now it's her left foot. She called the other day to say she is having trouble getting to the dining room! So DH and I take her out to a casino the next morning and she walked so fast we had to hurry to keep up with her! Her feet seemed fine and she had no trouble getting around the casino and the buffet line.  She has been asking to move in with us but we don't have the room. DH and I are retired with a small pension and have a little house we can afford. Would she be exaggerating her foot problems so that she has a reason to move in with us?  Whenever she has pain or says she can't get to her meals it's an emergency in my opinion and I have to call the Dr make appointments take her and then explain what the Dr. said over and over. She may do what the Dr says or she may not. She was stubborn even before the Alz.  I'm afraid I sound un-caring right now but I guess I'm feeling a little stressed. Mom is always needing some kind of attention and my DH is getting stressed to.

Her pain is always worse than anyone else's. No one understands her. No one listens to her and everybody talks about her.  Geez!  She has always been this way.  No one (including all three of my siblings) can stand my mom more than an hour at a time.  She is better behaved around others generally which annoys me even more because it shows me that she is capable of controlling her inappropriate and selfish behavior.  It feels bad to say she is selfish but I heard it said once that being sick doesn't make someone a saint.  She was selfish before she got AD and now it is magnified.  Rather than just vent I will ask what is a compassionate way to tell Mom I would like time alone in the den without having to ""hide"" in my bedroom?  I don't want to hurt her feelings if I can keep from it but I need space sometimes.",False,DAnn45,2016-06-23,22.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531944,,,AlzConnected,,,

Recently she kicked one of her favorite CGs out because my mom said she disassembled all the flashlights in the house- of course it was my mother who did this.

To my question:  Is moving her into her new home possibly as early as two days after hernia repair surgery a reasonable idea?  Is that too soon and if so any suggestions on a better time frame?  A week later?  The owner was a nurse and she gets up with residents in the night but is tacking on a recent surgery on top of the dynamics of adjusting to this new living situation going to be too much for both of them?    I haven't asked the AFH owner yet but intend to.  She's a saint and I could see her saying ""no problem"".  Who knows how Mom will respond to the surgery anesthesia (don't know what they'll use yet) sutures tape over the sutures etc.  She had to have a sitter while in the hospital last summer because she pulled her IV's out twice.    After typing all of this I think I know the best course of action  .  But I'd still really appreciate any suggestions experiences feedback...

She is keep falling these days. But she have another health issues like COPD type 2 diabetic Sciatica nerve pinch and pain in her hip and knees because of Arthritis. According to her Insurance case manager she is ready for Hospice care She told me that i will get extra help from them to manage her pain and all. I agreed with her nothing i know about Hospice i told her to set up arrangement for her. Last Monday Hospice nurse stop by and sign all those paper work with me. in my understanding they are going to help my mom's pain and her Alzheimer. right now she is ok not bad. Her family doctor call me left a massage on my answering Machine saying that my mother does not need hospice care she is in her early stage. I told Hospice nurse about every thing what my mother's doctor think. I am lost here. Now i am thinking did i make an wrong decision for her. Right now my mother is living with me and trust me i do not want to take her trust away by making any kind of wrong decisions for her. I have other siblings but my mother trust me and my husband. My mother is having a delusions that my other siblings trying to kill her so is my dad. I do not know what to do I need help from you all.

I stayed Tuesday night but had to attend a work meeting the next morning. I came back in the evening later that day (Wednesday) for several hours and she had been slightly delirious that afternoon (per the nurse report) because they had to give her pain meds as her pain was at an 8 per my mom's report. When I got there she seemed better but as the evening wore on she thought she was staying in a hotel but wasn't combative etc. I (with her care coordinator who does all her in home care coordinating) hired a retired nurse to ""sit"" with her overnight. They seemed to get on well but my mom was a little ornery (that is not out of the ordinary for her personality) but oriented- mostly. By midnight she was delirious I was home asleep 30 miles away exhausted and the nurse told me not to come. I found out this morning when I called at 5AM the hospital staff had to give her two doses of antipsychotics (shots-against my mom's will essentially- I'm fine with that she needed them) use a lap restraint and have two sitters in the room with her so she wouldn't get out of bed. I was really trying to go to work today but they won't discharge her until her mentation is back to baseline and if she doesn't get discharged she has to stay another night which of course means more delirium.   The morning I was to  pick my mom up for her surgery I discovered my car got broken into over night. Huge rains here in CA so had to park my vandalized car in her garage and take an uber to the hospital. Long story short I had to go back to her house in the afternoon yesterday so the glass people could fix my car window. While there and waiting for them to arrive and do their thing I decided to clear out a layer of crap in her garage-who needs three kitty litter boxes when your cat died two years ago? or boxes from her computer (7 yrs old) for that matter. You get the idea. While sorting through things I came across 6 dissembled smoke detectors. I thought crap she has no detectors in her 3000 sq ft house?! I frantically start looking for where I know they were and see two remaining- one on the upper level and one on the lower floor. The ceilings are high so I haul out the ladder and in both cases they had no batteries in the alarms and I was only able to find one new battery in the house. There are a host of issues around the house that I don't have time/energy to fix that are potential hazards (light bulbs on the walkway that have to having house unscrewed to access the bulb and the correct bulb purchases replaced.... and other stairways that have fixtures from the 70s that only take 40W bulbs etc)   My brother (who is in Japan on vacation now- in his ""defense"" he didn't know she was having surgery during his vacay- not that he'd have helped anyway) who does nothing generally could be helping me with these types of repairs: (and I have asked) and help her sell the car that sits in her garage etc. When he is in town while he relaxes at home on the weekends and takes day trips and gets a new puppy and kitten....I have to miss my work (I'm just beginning a new career) for the second or third time in about 5 months to be there for my mom. He makes me angry ( I did send him a text today telling him what's going on and how it's impacting me- not that that makes a hill of beans difference) and so does this disease.

This likely isn't due to the disease this  most likely would've been her response under the best of circumstances.

My Grandma is at stage 6 and is currently living in a memory care facility.  Up until August of last year she was living alone in Prescott.  Her boyfriend gave her his car to drive home when he was hospitalized (she has no license and hadn't been driving for months) and she got lost for hours and ended up stuck very far from home unable to work the car anymore.  In order for her to be safe and near all of us in Phoenix she was put in this facility.  Now that we have had time to plan we have made a plan to move her to our house and care for her.  We are being told that this is a bad move that she will go downhill that she will be so scared and disturbed by a change in surroundings that she will just die.  We are able to  and do take her out into the world 2-3 times a week she eats at restaurants goes to museums visits houses goes to holiday celebrations.  She has said she would love to live with my family when asked casually when she's here.  She's mostly fine at the facility although she hates being locked in she hates not having freedom to go outside she hates crafts and coloring and cutting out paper.  She frequently has her bags packed and is ready for us to pick her up.  She doesn't like to see people ""disappear"" from the home.  So everything I have read has been a person going into an assisted living home in the stage where they think they are doing just fine and the struggle is making that change.  I understand they go downhill they are scared disturbed when this happens.  However I haven't read a situation where you take that person home to be with family.  Am I having wishful thinking that this is the right thing for her and I will really cause her pain?",False,Samars,2017-01-17,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531342,,,AlzConnected,,,

Some days it just feels like we're caught in the middle and we'll go before any of them.  My own physical pain levels are exploding after all this time.  The worst part is we feel no one is there for us.  How do we keep going on without dropping over ourselves?  I don't really believe there is an answer for that one.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531583,,,AlzConnected,,,

It never gets easier with this disease,As I stated in another thread my sister and I have been caring for mom since she was diagnosed with VD ten years ago.  My sister lived with mom and went through pure hell taking care of mom.  I had mom in the afternoon until my sister got home.  Sister took over all evening till the next morning.  In the mornings we have a caregiver from 9:00 - 3:00 (weekdays only)    Then my sister suddenly passed away in December 2016.  So I moved in immediately to take care of mom.  From my experience in the past 10 years I'm afraid to say it just gets harder every month.  Just when you think things are unbearable things get worse.  I absolutely hate this disease.  We're now in the very final stretch.  Mom hasn't eaten or drank anything for the last two days.  Her body is just dead weight.  I used to hold her under the shoulder while she took clumsy baby steps but now she can't do that either.  I almost fell last night while trying to hold her up and pull up her diapers and pj's.    All I can do now is sit next to her and moisten her lips with one of those sponges that has a stick.  I used to clean her mouth with it after dinner but now it's just used to keep her lips moist.  And once in a while she opens her mouth and I try to rub it inside her mouth as well.  It's really depressing.  She doesn't seem to be in any pain.  The hospice nurse was here a couple of days ago and showed me the morphine in their emergency pack they had shipped to me.  The hospice has been absolutely horrible and provided very little support.  I hate not having my sister around to help and share in the pain.  My sister had a burst brain aneurysm in December.  Whey they took her off life support they said she could possibly breathe on her own for months.  So they administered morphine every hour every time increasing the dose.  They do this until she stops breathing.  My sister took her last breath after 6 hours.  I asked the hospice if they could do the same for mom.  They said it's not the same thing.  They are not allowed to do that.  I can't believe watching her deteriorate away is considered more humane.  I mean she's not eating drinking can't talk just stares into space it's almost like it's already over.    But I know there are only a few more days left and it will all be over.  10 years of pure hell.  And I know these are gonna be the hardest of all the days.  Just watch her rot away in bed and try to keep her comfortable.  As a 50 year old male I'm a living mess of emotions.    My best wishes to those who are just starting their journey.  It's gonna be a really rough ride that will test your endurance and emotions to the greatest extend.  Good luck to all.,False,HowardVal,2017-01-30,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531660,,,AlzConnected,,,

I so feel his pain.  This past weekend my mom was convinced that I was my sister.  I suppose that I should be glad that she thought I was my sister but I'm not.  Not really.  I don't think she always knows that she's our mother.  I have a picture that my mom took maybe 45 years ago.  She's standing proudly with her three daughters all dressed alike.  Perfectly put together.  For some reason that's how she stands out in my mind.    Sometimes my sorrow over the loss of that woman is so overwhelming.  She has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  The two diseases have stolen my mom most of the time.  Her vision has been attacked and she has a cataract in her one good eye.  Because she constantly picks at herself the doctor says that the surgery while simple isn't a good idea because she could lose the sight in that eye if she picked it right after the surgery.    She was anal retentive in her neatness.  Now I have to bathe and feed her and clean the food off of her.  Her nose will run but she doesn't seem to realize it.  She has no clue about how to dress herself or take care of any hygiene.  I can do all of that for her but the hardest part is when she tells me that something hurts.  She may have a headache but she may say that her arm hurts or or stomach.  It's a guessing game because she can't point to the hurt either.

Her CG assures me it is nothing unexpected for the surgery she has (her CG has been doing exercises with her been with my mom when she is visit by the in home Physical Therapist and assures me she is fine).  The PT will come again to my mom's today and I briefed her on the above situation and ask that she be on the look out for anything indicating something has been torn or broken- bruising swelling the like. The PT said she would and if she saw any of that she would suggest to my mom and her CG that she be xrayed). I know that my mom is just confused and she's never been this way before to this degree this is new.  To add to this I had a BFF living in my building (HAD- she still lives in my building but we no longer speak) and around the time my mom was beginning to show AD symptoms and I was growing increasingly concerned she wasn't there for me. She hurt me in a lot of other ways and our friendship broke down. In the last year her HEALTHY 82 year old mother came to live with her. Her mother never liked me (her mother is an odd angry woman) but that's another story. What is really bothering me today is I was doing laundry in the communal laundry room and she came in to retrieve her laundry. She says hello to me-and for the last year or so I couldn't even say hello (I was that disappointed in her as a my ""BFF) to her. She was folding her laundry and I had just had a relatively incoherent phone discussion with my mom and I wanted to say to my former BFF "" just so you know as I suspected my mom does have AD and she's loosing her mind and thanks for NOT being there for me when I needed you."" But I didn't I just seethed and thought- get out of here before I tear into you and she did.  Everyone in my life who I need to ask me how I'm doing (my oldest childhood friend who works has two kids a marriage and constant support) my brother who has a daughter and GF who are always doing fun things as a family my former BFF (described above) who left me when I needed her most doesn't. They don't call they don't check in. And I am MAD. Mad as hell. And alone and feeling stuck and grieving. I know I need to reach out and seek support but I am stuck and sad and wounded and unable.  Help me. I need advice and perspective and have no one to ask or to give me a hug or distract me and encourage me.",False,Radar007,2015-11-20,366.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531377,,,AlzConnected,,,

She gets little exercise and if her calories just came from meals she'd probably do fine.  She watches what she eats at mealtime.    But there are at least two issues:  she gets up in the middle of the night and snacks.  I don't always wake up but I see the cookies gone lots of them.  I don't think she's sleepwalking but she doesn't remember doing it later.    Then there is Starbucks.  When she lost her driver's license she seemed to develop a kind of fixation.  Her loss of independence meant she couldn't just run down to Starbucks if she wanted.  So she doesn't get to go as often but at some point she started ordering two venti drinks each time.  The drinks alone are probably over 1000 calories.  I tried speaking to her about it but she wasn't very receptive.  She hasn't said so to me but to her mom she's mentioned several times that ""we all know what I'm going to die from...""  She is already having more trouble moving around and is having problems with one of her knees.  She had lost weight several years ago and before losing it had pain in her hip.  If it keeps going at this rate it won't be the Alzheimer's she dies from it will be this.  And as she starts needing help in some later stages with hygiene and such I worry that I won't be able to help her physically if she gains much more weight.",False,mcarley,2016-05-16,95.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147531511,,,AlzConnected,,,

I had hoped they would be able to use a local anesthetic but the anesthesiologist felt she needed to have general anesthesia.

623,62105ab57b65de9a5b6658e9,2147531054,2017-01-05 00:36:00,Everything at once. Need to vent even if it makes me feel guilty.,Just to start I just joined this website a few minutes ago. So Hiall!  I have been saying almost as a joke for for years now  Ineed to join a support group for caregivers. In the last year itstopped being a joke and something I really should have done. But Iavoided it I don't know why. Maybe because it made me feel like itwas more real and like if I need a support group I am not handlingeverything like I wish I could. You all probably understand thatsomewhat.  But recently my mothers (shes really my mother in law but Inever ad the 'in law') anxiety has gotten worse to where I cantleave her alone at night (after the sun goes down) any longer shegoes into a panic attack. Realizing I may need someone to come intothe home so I can go out made me search seriously for a group andman my area of Canada does not make it easy to do anything from thecomfort of your home. I would need to go into their office (but Icant leave her to go do that) and making the call to ask for infowould have hear listening and getting upset. So here I am    I wish I had a friend to vent to who understood but at this pointI don't know anyone else who has had a family member with memoryissues. This is my third person. I was involved daily wih mygrandmothers care from the time I was 15 and she went into a seniorshome. I was not there for the final stage when she got angry and meanand then forgot everyone. And for that I feel guilty and blessed aswell. My mother lives on the other coast in California and she hasalzheimers which started after a stroke. She was not the nicestperson before the stroke but now she has no filter. She now cares ifshe hurts people it makes her feel bad and upset but she has noidea what shes saying and cant help it now. I talk to her daily andhave to call the siblings who live more near her when something seemsoff. But I cant do anything active from 3000miles away. Then theresmy mother in law. I left her son almost two years ago (spring 2015)and when I told her I was leaving with the kids she said 'where arewe moving'. I joke that I got my mother in law in the divorce    She was diagnosed when she was 60 with early onset alzheimers butin all honesty she had had it for three or four years prior to meforcing the doctors visits and diagnosis on the family. Everyone else(her son and sisters) wanted to live in denial. She immediatelyhad her license revoked. Theres a center here that does a road testand cognitive testing on a computer which she failed. She was upsetand wanted to tell them they were wrong until I just straight outtold her Mom have you not noticed you have not driven my kids fortwo years? They are not aloud to get in the car with you. So she saidfine and gave up driving.   Shes only in the first stages. its been so slow progressing that Ihave to think back 6 months and try to compare to get a honest isthis the same or worse perspective. I know a lot or even most of youare dealing with situations so far down the line from me that maybeme complaining seems unfair. You probably look back and wish for theeasy days that I am now going through.  Her personality has changed alittle bit shes a HUGE flirt now after thinking men were uselessfor most of her life. But she doesn't seem to realize shes flirtingeven as men turn red she thinks shes just being nice. Things irritateher that never would have years ago. Her patience for noise is gone.She was the most meek and mild person you'd ever know and now shesnaps at people on occasion. You'd never think it was a big deal ifyou didn't know her before. She lies constantly to cover forsomething she doesn't know of confuses her. She sneaks food in herroom for some reason no one cares if you eat a chocolate bar LOL noneed to eat it in your closet in your room. hahahaha. small thingslike she forgets shes met people so shes 'happy to finally meet' myfriend once a month even though shes been in and out of my house foryears before the divorce. She no longer has access to herinvestments she was draining them without realizing to by callingher person and asking her to sell X for 5k for a vacation. 1 shedidn't need that kind of cash for a small cruise with her sister and2 she forgot shed already asked for the money so she had called fourtimes before her person called and asked her if she could come intothe office with someone who she was okay with talking about her moneywith. So that's all good. she has her bank account with cash forliving and her sister watches the other stuff. So really shes notbad. Its really the new anxiety that's giving me pause. Yes we arewaiting to get into her doctor to discuss. But it seems like mylittle family of four is all being beat up at once and I am alone indoing it all.  My youngest had and injury summer of 2015 and then pain disorderwhich stemmed from it. It effected everything. Constant pain kept herfrom friends school at times made her isolate herself from family.She used crutches for 8 months. Barely got out of bed. Suffereddepression and I had three nights I didn't leave her room except topee because I was scared she would hurt herself. She was mean and ithurt everyone around her. Just as she started recovering WALKING! wefound out an unrelated genetic issue we had been just keeping an eyeon had awoken and we totally missed any chance of alternativetherapies. She needed a surgery. She was under the knife for a backsurgery before she was even walking without a limp yet. As f today mydaughters still depressed some still working on anxiety and hassensory overload. So large groups of people or noisy places just dontwork for her.  Only after the surgery did we all start dealing withthe divorce before that we were all in a shock stage and then toobusy with health. My older daughter has gone through a breakdown ofsorts for herself. She missed a week of highchool the first month shestarted. Her anxiety peeked to such levels that she called methinking she was having a heart attack. I had to drive to the schoolwhile on the cell phone trying to talk her through what I knew 100%was a panick/anxiety attack. Shes in therapy dealing learning tocope but as you all probably know its a slow road to travel.  Im also monitoring her for another health issue she may havewhich if the testing proves positive can cause infertility and lifelong weight issues among other things. We just started testing tofind out why my younger daughters memory doesn't seem to be bouncingback she is healing it should be improving too but its just notand she walks around in a daze sometimes for no reason. I just had amass removed from my throat a few days ago I haven't heard anythingback about it so it cant be anything scary right? And they also hadto stretch my esophagus and apparently my stomach is up in my ribsfor some reason guess thats explains a few things. I ended upback in the ER with a post op complication and for the first timecame up against 'what do I do with mom'? Until then I had always hadtime to make a plan with one of her friends or getsomething done when I knew she would be out with her church friends.Thankfully her friend was home and able to drop everything to comeget her. But I was left in the situation of waiting to call anambulance until she left so she wouldn't be more upset than shealready was.  What if her friend hadn't been home? Within twodays of this I realized there is some hard mass growing in my nasalcavity in the last two weeks while waiting for my Dr apt nextweek (holidays what can you do) its grown and changed the shapeof my nose.    I wanted to go unload on a friend but she works so could onlymeet up after work. I went to leave and mom had a panic attack. Shejust couldnt deal with the idea of me leaving her in the dark myteenagers were home still but for the first time that wasnt goodenough. And I don't know if this is my imagination but when she getsscared she turns back into a child. Crying the way she holdsherself the words she uses and even her face all the sudden seemschildlike somehow. Is that even a thing?? It must be my imagination.So I ended up bringing my entire family to dinner and just sitting ata second table within visual distance of my kids and mother. I didntknow what else to do last minute. I really needed to get out. So Ihave spent this week doing phone interviews with people responding tomy add about a companion for my mother. There are three retirednurses who worked with alzheimers patients whom I will meet with inthe house with Mom Friday. Time to start something now so I can getout and stay sane. So I can go to the doctor sense it appears Imfalling apart. And so when she really needs more 'care' maybe shewill already know and be comfortable with this person.       Im so overwhelmed with everyone'shealth. If it was just one of them Id never say boo to anyone. I canhandle a lot. But three anxiety riddled people with their ownsituations they cant each deal with. With one active child and oneisolated child and mom who puts away dirty dishes and is attached tomy hip well... I seem to cry a lot at night when everyone else isasleep. I dont even know why Im crying. Other than maybe exhaustionstress worry raging hormones (did I mention mine are all out ofwack) and no support besides one of moms sisters who will keep an eyeon her finances. Thats all.      Honestly if I read this four years agoI would have thought the writer was exaggerating or hell maybe shes ahypochondriac. And I didn't even mention that I had a back surgerythe year before all the stuff above which was held off for a yearwhile I recovered after acquiring a heart virus while on vacation inHawaii which nearly killed me.

She was getting out of bed to go to the bathroom and the blanket tangled around her feet. She fell and got a pretty nasty gash above her eye that require stitches they also found 3 compression fractures in her spine.  She went into the ER on Wednesday and has been in the hospital ever since. Its really hard to tell if she's in pain... her elbow definitely hurts but other then that she will say she's not in pain.   The options for treatment for her back injury was a brace or a minor surgery called kyphoplasty. The brace sounds ridic given her mental status there is no way she will keep that on. She doesn't even remember she fell she keeps trying to get out of bed.   Apparently kyphoplasty is a half hour procedure where they stick needles into your back and fill broken vertebrae with cement. Its supposed to help with pain relief and stabilization of the spine.  I worry about putting her through any kind of procedure I have asked for a second opinion from a renowned spine surgeon who works at the hospital where I work. My dad seems hell bent on getting it done he scheduled it for tomorrow.   I just don't want to put her through a potentially traumatic procedure (and anesthesia) without being certain that it will actually help. The goal from my dad's standpoint is to stabilize her spine so that if she were to fall again the injury would be less severe and not require a more major surgery.  Adding to this.... she had a seizure on Saturday morning. The first time that has ever happened. Her EEG was normal so they don't seem to be concerned with the surgery from a seizure standpoint.

629,62105b107b65de9a5b665ade,2147530951,2016-12-31 17:29:00,Reposting for CleoS,"CleoS - I'm starting a new thread for you so you can get some advice:  This is my first post. I apologize that it is lengthy but I am at a loss and feel as though I have no support. I need some honest advice. Here is some background to help you understand what I am dealing with.   Just returned from Christmas. My Mother (75) is a narcissist and has always been difficult. She has to be center of attention treats my father terribly gaslights never takes responsibility for bad or hurtful behavior unbelievably defensive and easily hurt and has given little to no attention or concern for her 7 grandchildren. She gives money as gifts as she truly does not know who they are does not care or want to put in any effort. She can only show her love by worrying constantly about everything. She had a very difficult childhood (foster care) but since marrying my father she has had a really nice life. My father is no picnic and is a narcissist as well. He has never given her enough attention but she is an endless pit. He is not cruel and in his old age has become a whipping boy.   This holiday was incredibly difficult. Although she has never been easy her behavior was different. She usually manages to be injured or have some malady that she can talk about or have everyone focus on. She came with no injury but was constantly talking about future procedures that she would like to have but cannot due to money (they have a ton of money). My three siblings and I feel that these surgeries are not necessary and cause her harm. She waits too long for necessary procedures and when she finally has them there always seems to be complications. She claimed to have a heart condition for years which was anxiety. She needs to have something wrong.  She had to be a part of every conversation. She would interject at inappropriate times with nonsense that somehow referred the conversation back to her. She would insult the kids and then laugh about it and continue as if it were a joke. She would complain at length about her insomnia her back aches her muscle cramps. When you offered solutions she would go as far as threatened to kill herself if you forced her to do something that was a clear option to help. Every time she entered the car she informed everyone that she has back pain and she has to get in the car and out a certain way. The 5th time she said this one of the kids responded ""For the 100th time gram...."" She laughed and said ""oh you be quiet."" She wasn't angry.  The entire family went for a walk after dinner and she started to lag behind. You have to watch her as she falls often and has broken bones including her nose wrist and foot. She became agitated and when we asked what was wrong she claimed we were ignoring her. We were a party of 14+ people walking.  When we all gathered around her her mood improved. At another point she yelled across the room at my brothers who were having a conversation demanding to know what they were talking about.   She would attack my father out of nowhere. She was abusive. She has always been cruel to him but this was out of control. She rolled her eyes and called him a wimp. All this because my brother asked him about his shoulder pain from golf. As my father started to answer she hissed and told him to shut up and nothing compared to the pain she has endured. When my sister told her she was being harsh she ripped into her and then bolted out of the room. This is not normal. My father is getting more quiet and squirrelly.   At dinner she forgot major parts of dishes that she had been making for 25 years. When pointed out she would angrily explain that she meant to do it that way. She could not follow directions regarding plating food (potatoes in a too small container) and became defensive and angry when you tried to redirect. She would ask crazy questions regarding obvious things that were right in her face. At a restaurant she yelled at a waiter to take care of the cool breeze coming in through the door. She was cold!  Her mental state is off and we feel she is experiencing signs of dementia. She is making my father's life hell. I know that if we say something regarding getting her evaluated she will go nuts. This is an injury that a narcissist like her cannot handle. She will threatened to kill herself she will blow up. I don't know what to do. She will refuse. I am concerned about her driving. I am concerned about my dad. She has always been an emotional endless pit but this level of verbal abuse that will be directed at my father has to take a toll. Where do I start? She had an eye lift at 73 against everyone's advise including the doctor. My father begged her not to do it. She had horrific complications and now seems to relish complaining about it. She will not listen to anyone. My brothers and sister don't know what to do. All the grandchildren don't like her due to her past behavior and this holiday was especially bruising. They are having a hard time understanding that this behavior is somehow different. We are all afraid of her response and what she will say to my father. She is verbally so vicious.   How do I start?

It was mainly affecting his short-term memory but in recent months he has really seemed to go downhill to the point that my 80-year old Mom is just unable to care for him anymore. He was up all hours of the night and couldn't be left alone. Right before Halloween we had him admitted to the hospital when he had a really bad episode saying he was in pain and he was in tears. They determined he had Congestive Heart failure his kidneys were only functioning at 5%-10% and he had pneumonia. He was also diagnosed earlier this year with multiple myeloma which is contributing to the kidney issue. They inserted a shunt two weeks ago and started him on dialysis. He never liked being in the hospital before but now he is getting angry and having outbursts and getting really nasty to us when we tell him we can't take him home which is not my Dad at all. I understand all this is part of the disease and I can deal with the outbursts and the fact that he pushed me a little once but he has pushed my Mom a few times during these outbursts too and she is not able to handle him physically. A social worker at the hospital had him admitted to rehab at a nursing facility last week to build up his strength. Yesterday they arranged for a ride to his foot doctor to treat an infection but he refused to get in the van to go back to the nursing facility after the appointment. They finally got him in but when they got back he refused to go back inside. The facility called the police to take him to our local psychiatric ward for evaluation because he was being so belligerent. The police refused to transport him there so the nursing facility gave him something to calm him down and then they called a local mental health center in to evaluate him. They recommended in-patient treatment but because of his other underlying medical issues they couldn't take him. They then recommended 3 other local hospitals that could handle both the psychiatric and medical issues. The nursing home said they tried getting him in those but couldn't get him in and he ended up being sent to the local psychiatric ward and was put on a 72 hour hold which means he will be released late Sunday or Monday morning. I live 30 miles away and my sister who has been helping out too just found out this morning that she is having surgery and will be out of commission for a while. I had taken the day off yesterday to attend a financial planing seminar put on by the Alzheimer's Association and had just gotten out of that when we found out the police were being called to take him away. So we know we have a lot of work to do to find him a safe place to be and get things in order but right now we need some immediate idea of where to go when he is released this weekend. My Mom doesn't feel she can take care of him anymore and is afraid to be alone with him at home with his recent outbursts so going home is not an option. Any thoughts on how to find quick care for him?,False,bphillips,2016-11-18,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147530101,,,AlzConnected,,,

We saw his neurologist as soon as possible and his diagnosis is apraxia (multiple kinds).  His EEG showed the activity in the left side of his brain is very slow.  There has been a lot of white matter damage including in the frontal lobe.  My LO had some mild dementia before his illness but now it is very bad.  The first 10 days home from the hospital he could not communicate any of his needs.  Cutting back on his seizure meds helped and now he can hold simple conversations and watch TV.  He still cannot tell us what he needs.  We watch his body language and ask him if he needs food drink pain meds etc.  He cannot support any of his own weight on his feet.  We have to keep an eye on him because he will try to get out of bed when he feels an urge to go to the bathroom or is bored.  PT OT and ST will all start after Thanksgiving.  I'm hoping they will teach me how to give him more help in relearning very basic skills such as using a spoon or fork.  out of space,False,Mary T,2016-01-04,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147530174,,,AlzConnected,,,

Being nonambulatory she is a 1 or 2 person transfer either stand and pivot or two people living with pad. She resists being transferred strenuously. I can lift and pivot someone of her weight but when she is actively trying with all her might to sit back down it is challenging to say the least. I have a PT coming for an evaluation of transferring; I would like to make it as stress-free as possible for her but I have my doubts as she is not able to be very cooperative.   When we transfer her she screams.  She yells at me for hurting her. She screams that I am cruel and that I am trying to hurt her: 'what is wrong with you people? Why do you like to hurt me?' She has said words to the effect that she cannot wait until it is my turn to be treated so badly. I have noticed that when it is our regular aide she carries on less and accuses less. I know that this is the disease talking and I understand the lack of muscle control and proprioception.  The hospice nurse tells me it is more fear than pain.  I am sorry that she is in so much fear and pain and I hope that the PT consult can make this a bit easier.  But I am sick to my stomach that she is screaming at me and accusing me of wanting to hurt her.  In the past 11 months I have seldom slept in my own bed as I sleep either in the call room at work or on the couch at Mom's. At this point I am making a 400 mile round trip on a weekly basis while holding down a full -time job.  My siblings breeze in and out; they live locally so there is no question of missing a night in their own homes and it is clear that they regard the responsibility as mine not theirs. I have to beg them to sit with her for a couple of hours if our regular aide needs a couple of hours off for personal business or if I have to go to the store to buy groceries and adult diapers (yes I am responsible for most of the shopping)...and as for covering a day forget about it...but they do resent the money it costs to have an aide.  Tonight when moving her to the commode I (as usual) explained we were going to help her to move to the commode. She (as usual) told me she didn't need any help and didn't want me to touch her because we are horrible and cruel and just want to hurt her.  I am on day 4 straight of this besides juggling extended family for Thanksgiving visit.  Kinda lost it told her go ahead stand up I won't touch you...or sit there and poop your pants. Yep real proud of myself. Moved her with help of aide got her off commode in bed cleaned up with steady tirade of how horrible and cruel I am.   I feel guilty as hell: I am not there enough and when I am I am obviously woefully inadequate. I hate myself for not finding the joy and enlightenment in this that others do. I don't have children so the schadenfreude of Mom wanting to see me in the same straits cuts pretty deeply  as I will no doubt be dependent on the care of unlicensed personnel in a crappy nursing home if I last that long.   Sorry to be such a downer.

She's hesitant to ask her caregivers to help her with some simple  tasks and instead chooses to call me an increasing number of times a day - somewhere between two and 10 times a day.   As a result my anxiety is increasing I've always had acid reflux but it's causing breakthrough My pain to break through my mess) from all the stress).  Should also add that I have a brother who does nothing so I do everything. The aforementioned  are just kind of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reasons why I can't engage with her at this level anymore. I'll see her once to twice a week and I'm taking her on vacation over Christmas to visit family. I love her to death but I just can't keep doing this to myself. I feel guilty for drawing firm boundaries and I don't know how to stop the guilt though I know intellectually my choice is the correct one.

She doesn't trust any medical providers and uses holistic health remedies only so it's impossible to get an official diagnosis. A retired psychologist herself she talks an  incredibly  good game. I have no idea if others can notice the paranoia manipulation illogical behavior loss of sense of time super-agitated and then sleepy symptoms that I do because she resists telling me the names of her close friends and contacts. She does this because her paranoia is focused on my husband who is pretty good with technology and so she thinks he's wire-tapping her phone interfering in our communication trying to hack her accounts etc. I posted here before to ask 'what do I do?' with such a resistant independent ES mom and many of you sent virtual hugs but said unfortunately I need to wait until she is not as functional to step in hoping and wishing nothing bad happens meanwhile. So I've been in a kind of holding pattern. This year she hurt her back but refuses x-rays etc and is walking with a limp and having trouble getting up and down. I brought her to my own doctor and she refused treatment. It's hard to watch.   This Christmas she is here to visit us for three weeks. I made the decision to have her stay with a close family friend nearby for the holidays. Partly this is to 'preserve' my 5-year old daughter's vision of her as a normal grandma as long as possible and partly also to protect my daughter's relationship with her daddy (mom is master of the snide comment about hubs and kiddo is starting to be confused by her behavior). We see her every day but it is raising a host of issues and questions for me-- how much can I hide from my kiddo? Is this just selfish of me to think I can 'stage' a happy holidays for a few more years? I lucked out for housing this visit but I can't depend on it every time-- how to cope as things progress? How much to a share with my friends about my 'real' mom the ones they don't see as I do? Do I take her to the usual holiday parties with friends and coworkers and meanwhile worry the whole time that she will go off at me in public? Also I notice I go into a depression every time I'm around her from the hurtful comments and the 'veil' of negativity that she sees in everything-- what's my responsibility as an adult child to someone who doesn't want to acknowledge her sickness and causes pain every time we're together? Mom raised me by herself and was a dedicated parent to the extreme and I don't want to let her down but I am miserable around her right now because my hands are tied and I feel I just have to 'take it.'   How do others manage responsibilities to their own young families and ES parents or loved ones around the holidays?    Thanks so much...,False,CaliMom,2015-06-17,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147530594,,,AlzConnected,,,

I knew it wasn't because she didn't have the right symptoms.  The urologist cleared her so I knew it wasn't due to UTIs'.  Her pcp finally referred her to a neurologist at the end of October.  She had progressed rapidly.  At least he started from scratch testing her for the basic treatable dementias.  Then last month Nov. he diagnosed her with Alzheimer's.  I found it ironic that it was Alz. Awareness Month.  I haven't been home except for a quick 2 week trip since April.  My husband has been wonderful.  I am just so angry about this situation.  How could this happen so quickly? The neurologist says it's not an RPD.  I don't know what to do.  She doesn't always remember my husband of 25 years.  She is so verbally abusive to my father &amp; to me at times.  Her neuro. md told her she could not drive.  This has just about put her over the edge.  I lose my patience when she is verbally abusive &amp; then immediately feel guilty b/c I know she can't help it.  I feel guilty when I escape to my room b/c I just can't stand to see it or I feel myself becoming impatient.  All I can think is that one day she won't be here or completely unable to talk to me &amp; I will wish I had spent every minute with her.  I had to take my Dad to the ER the other night.  I thought he was having a dissecting aneurysm.  It turned out he didn't but his heart rhythm is very irregular now since all this happened.  I was there at the ER by myself with him.  Even though I was an ER nurse my whole career I wanted to be able to turn to Mom so badly.  I just at least wanted to be able to call her.  I couldn't.  I could see in her eyes when we left for the hospital that she didn't get it.  I feel I have already lost her. It's killing me.  I get so mad when she is being mean to Dad &amp; me; I just want to be able to tell her what we've been going through...how much we're hurting &amp; worried.  I've ended up in the ER with chest pain &amp; am now on heart med.    I haven't totally accepted her diagnoses because it's happening so rapidly.  I don't know what to do.  I can't seem to fix it or even get someone who can.  I am just so angry.  And profoundly sad. I spend most of my time listening to music surfing a facebook group I really like &amp; playing online games (part of that is that I lost memory concentration ability etc. &amp; the games are helping bring my mind back).  I call it getting into my ""bubble"" because I don't let myself think about anything that is going on. That's the only way I can cope is by dealing with it in bits &amp; pieces.   Thank you for letting me use this space to vent.  It just came pouring out once I started typing.  I'm sorry for the typos but I can't proof it: I've finally stopped crying &amp; if I read over it I'll just start crying again.  So I hope it's not too bad.",False,trazom96,2016-12-16,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147530634,,,AlzConnected,,,

I work full-time and we have 2 high school kiddos at home.      We have companion care 4 hrs/day M-T-W-Th 9:30-1:30 and a friend/neighbor on F mornings (she is in and out during the week also and does grocery shopping for in-laws)  Weekend care givers are my husband and I. MIL was on a variety of meds for pre-diabetes nerve pain and back pain until a hospital admission in July 2016 and since that time began refusing meds.  We tapered and discontinued her narcotic pain meds Fall 2015 since they caused her to be more unsteady on her feet and ""zombied"" mentally.      Due to aggressive behavior anxiety belligerence and sundowning/not sleeping and to be able to bathe MIL change her clothes her Depends Hospice started MIL on Seroquel as a mood stabilizer and Remeron for sleep.  It has been titrated up to a dose of 150mg Seroquel twice a day (which can go higher) and 60mg Remeron at bed time (max dose per all dosing recommendations is 45mg of Remeron).  I crush and give these meds to her in food morning and night so there isn't a battle to get her to take her meds.  I also add CW Hemp oil morning and night and 0.5mg Haldol at night with her crushed meds.  She gets hydrocodone in morning and night and I am now giving her a small dose of morphine (0.25 to 0.5mg) once she is in bed...so...with all this she is still aggressive anxious belligerent and up and down during the night.  Hospice won't send in an aide for bathing because of her behavior so it is up to me and/or our companion care giver (neighbor has a bad back and can't help with any lifting) to accomplish any hygeine and personal care.  We usually manage by literally picking her up under her arms one on either side with her kicking and cursing and grabbing/pulling hair and digging her nails into any available flesh the whole time ... just to get a quick wipe down!  Bedtime is almost as bad except that once the Remeron kicks in she is groggy and pretty much dead weight.     MIL's appetite increased enormously with the addition of Seroquel and Remeron but is now back to what it was before which was very little and very selective.     My ""I don't know"" is:  it doesn't seem like these meds are helping and I don't want to tell hospice how to do their business but is there something we are missing here?  I know she is frustrated but I really dread any activity that requires us to do anything against her will...but we can't just let her fester in her own stew!",False,Chammer,2016-07-31,44.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147530304,,,AlzConnected,,,

I needed someone to drive me home and my mother (who usually drives me to and from and offers support during such events) is no longer really able to deal with these things and she no longer drives. Long story short we arranged for the person who cares for her to driver her to my house the night before (the procedure was early in the AM) and then another gal was to pick us up at my house in the AM and drive us to and from the hospital. The AM person didn't come. My mom could not understand why we couldn't take a cab there and home after (the hospital rules don't allow anyone to go home in a cab accompanied or otherwise-and I didn't want to go home alone with my mother after sedation if something goes wrong she hasn't a clue how to solve it)so we went round and round about that.  A few weeks before I'd asked my brother (he travels a lot for business) to be my emergency contact (it used to be my mother) he said yes but on the day of my procedure he told me he'd be out of town (he was the first person I asked to drive me home originally- I was delusional thinking he'd actually help). When I got to the hospital yesterday AM they asked for my emergency contact- I said my brother then remembered he's out of town so texted his GF who in an emergency could call him or come to the hospital they live 10 mins away from me and the hospital (my brother told me she couldn't drive me home because of work even though she works from home). I texted her and she said he WAS back in town. I could have reached through the phone and strangled her/ and him.  Then after my procedure my friend picked me up we went to lunch and then she wanted to go home and lie down. I went home and spent the rest of the day feeling down and depressed. I couldn't really do anything I had been so heavily sedated in the AM.  I also have the last night of graduate school tonight. My mom and I always said we'd take a big trip (think safari or something like that) when I was done but now she can hardly remember I'm graduating barely remembered it was my birthday let alone go on a transatlantic trip.  I'm single no children most of my friends have teenage kids and are busy with their families. I'm just realizing that even though my mom is still her and sort of with-it I'm alone in the world. To boot she's having a knee replacement surgery early next year this is her second in a years time and she has to have it done or she won't be able to walk and soon she won't understand why she can't walk if she doesn't get it done not to mention what the pain of a disfigured knee (from arthritis) would do to her behavior as she decompensates mentally if she doesn't get it done. After the surgery she is going to lose a lot of cognitive function and she'll likely need 24 hour care for the remainder of her life.  I'm just feeling really sorry for myself and really angry at my brother for being such an asshole.  Thanks for listening.

My DH has early onset Alzheimer's and was diagnosed immediately after an invasive very serious surgery. I am his only caregiver with no outside assistance. He was a white collar professional with serious professional responsibilities who was forced to retire by his employer. Over the past eighteen months we have chased Clinical Trials over most of the United States. He recently succeeded in being enrolled in one. I have watched him slide through at least two transitions during this period as I have watched a pride determined man be reduced to quiet anger and frustration at his growing inability to function. His Mother died of Alzheimer's and we were her primary care givers until the end so he does realize what is happening and what the end may be like. Our two children are not geographically close but very committed to their Father. I am also trying to help them deal with their pain and grief over this. I am tired and I'm not sure how to proceed at this point. Today he lost his two pairs of glasses then his checkbook etc. I spend most of my day looking for his things dealing with his frustration agitation and demands. Then I feel guilty over feeling the anger and fatigue.

She has worsening dementia cannot walk or even stand is on kidney dialysis three days a week has skin cancer and atrial fibrillation. I am 65 years old and have not yet been able to enjoy my retirement because of the heavy-duty care she requires. I have been lifting her (we weigh about the same) from wheelchair to bed or toilet many times a day. She refuses to stay put and is constantly wanting to go from one side of the house to the other. We get up at 4:30 a.m. three times a week so that I can drive her 20 miles there and back to her dialysis. That is the only time those nine hours that my husband and I have alone per week -- and we have to fit grocery shopping and errands in during that time if we want to do them together. We''ve lived fairly happily for a very long time but now as my mother''s dementia worsens she absolutely refused to be alone in one part of the room if I go to another to clean exercise or take a break on my computer. She is frightened about what is happening to her and is very very bored. I''ve bought puzzles books coloring books games notebooks videos and music from her era and she''s not interested in any of them. She refuses to even watch TV unless I sit right there with her. When she fell from her bed one night I heard her saying ""Yeah yeah yeah"" over and over and went to check on her. When I asked her why she didn''t call me she told me she didn''t think I was home. And that''s how it is -- if I''m not in eyesight I''m not home. She gets scared and I try to check on her every 10 minutes or so -- and she always thinks she''s alone in the house. Even writing this brief summation has been interrupted four times by her calling or yelling ""Yeah yeah yeah yeah."" I try taking her with me when I do chores but she won''t stay because it''s boring. Most of her friends are now deceased and she is rarely visited by any relatives. She is falling often now too. Because she will not listen to my instructions about holding onto my neck I am falling with her causing hip and back pain. If I try talking to my friends they either tell me that I'm just lucky to still have my mother or they try to force me to go do things with them when I really can't. We live in a small town with no day care or respite care resources. I wish she could post something here because she could tell you how bored and scared she is. There are always two sides of a story.

I made several phone calls to try and get some services for companion.  Something of an endless loop and companion will have to complete the process and it may be slow.   She may be facing neurosurgery and wound care is something that is offered by these organizations.  I was told that once she applies for assistance she can more easily be accommodated for other services.  She likes the sound of ""free"" so she will more than likely pursue this.      If mom will not evict her after seeing that companion is no longer useful to her I will have to use APS.  Care manager stated that she could see right away that mom sees the world as only about her  (correct) and any action against companion will have to come from her in order to work.  Hoarding is not a consideration only the drug sharing &amp; fear (mine) of physical harm.  I am not afraid now but if companion finds out that I reported drug sharing she may become a threat.  I laid the ground work for the drug sharing &amp; possible physical harm  in my letter to the psychiatrist several days ago which I shared with primary &amp; pain clinic doctors.  The pain clinic doctor's eye brows really went up   he read it in my presence.

She wants to go home thinks I live too far away does not like her view says no one talks with her and people are so old there. She is 83 has anxiety issues and a few other issues. She calls me 30 times a day complaining and saying how miserable it is there. We have only been there a few days but it is relentless. I cant take it. Help.

I wont make it. its too much.  A couple of notes. She is 83. Spends an enormous amount of time in bathroom trying to go pee. She has no problems going it is mental as is her stomach pain. She does take klonopin and tylenol for stomach pain. Her anxiety causes her incredible pain in her stomach been to many doctors and nothing is worng. She cannot take any anti anxiety drugs cause urinary problems. Stops her from peeing. The fact she cannot take anything at all for her anxiety causes problems. Distractions have helped at times but this move has increased anxiety a hundred fold. Feel I made the wrong decision again. Maybe I move her back where she was but a different room may cause same issues or similar issues. I have no idea. She had all same problems at other home just ramped up now with new move. We moved because felt she did not get proper care. Ignored often. She is mentally better than most people. recalls many things its the dam anxiety about peeing and stomcah pain.

She has pain and stiffness when standing and walking and is fearful of falling. She collapses a lot while walking. She only walks very short distances. Always says when she is walking that her legs are stiff and that it's because it is cold even though it is always in the 80's.

And I asked when things get worse what is going to happen? Doctor said she will need full transfer. And if we can't figure it out how to do it she would need nursing home.    I've not been down this road before so I am wondering can this be done at home?

Her test have been perpetually positive for a UTI since June. Her mood has become the new normal but I do not like that she is starting to have a dull pain near and around her kidneys. Meanwhile she has done 3 rounds of Macrobid and 1 round of Ampicillin (which we just finished). From what the at home tests suggest she is fine while she is on the antibiotics but it comes right back as soon as she stops. There is a good 90% chance that this is a hygiene issue.   Has anyone's LO ever gone on low dose daily antibiotics? Her blood sugar has been in the 300-400 range lately even though they increased her insulin.     Also I was told to look into Sitz baths has anyone ever had any luck with those or stick on bidet? I wonder if I could put one in a bedside comode?   We have a lot going on. Her best friend of 48 years recently passed away (so she officially has no friends). My mother cleaned $1245 out of my grandmas bank account (there were consequences for her). AND Mom never came by yesterday to check on her meaning Grams was left alone for 5 hours (and of course bad things happened).   Grandma has also stopped eating. She is on a major sugar kick. (I took her to lunch and she was trying to eat the jelly packets).  She is back to drinking maple syrup and eating sugar packets.    Fhits has really been hitting the proverbial san lately! We finally figured out that my mom has borderline personality disorder. I  am  also relatively confident that we will be looking back at these days in the next few years and realizing she was showing the early signs of dementia too (but she will be going to a home on medicaid because I ain't taking her in).   I tried to give my mother some basic responsibilities and she seems to be responding well to having to be accountable (i.e. less drinking more focused on wanting to work (at her job) waking up before 11am). But then she has these colossal screw-ups. Like stealing 1200 bucks. Or being just so inappropriately rude to Grams that it makes matters worse.   I was a parentified child. She was that mom who needed her kid to pick her up off the floor be tucked into bed and watched all night to make sure she was breathing/ laying on her side. She also used to take my paychecks out of the mail (back when they were mailed) cash them in her name and then reluctantly loan me back a fraction of my money ""because she is the best mom ever to help me out."" The stuff she has put me through mentally and financially... is why I am in therapy.   At this point I am thinking of selling everything and putting them both in a 55+ community but I don't know where to start. I am realizing they BOTH need care...  Mom is financially dependent on her parents since I am DPOA for both its under my discretion what happens to her by proxy. .   Sorry to vent. I just want out so badly but the more I try to get help the worse it gets. Im 25 hypertensive/arthritic and only can leave my house to go to work cvs or the grocery store.

She has intermittent abdominal pain and periods of nausea and vomiting as well as extreme fatigue Her urine has become cloudy gritty and rust colored but since she isn't running a temp and is on hospice the MC doctor has declined to take a urine culture or to treat her with any antibiotics. Should we advocate for her to get tested? I guess what I am concerned about is what if this abrupt physical decline and lack of appetite is caused by an infection and not just the body shutting down the reason we called in hospice.

My dad took my mom to the ER 6 weeks ago because she was throwing up and had diahrrea. She also had a ""shaking episode"" which he thought was a seizure.  The ER doctor said that she had the stomach flu and the shaking was not a seizure.  Also no UTI.  Due to her having another episode in the ER they decided to keep her over night for observation.   Her neurologist did visit her while she was there.  He said she might have been having a mini seizure but he didn't want to do an EEG due to them not showing up if she is not having one during the test. He said that we can put her on an anti seizure medication but it usually causes drowsiness and due to her level of AD her quality of like would decline much more which my dad did agree not giving her.  So now for the past 6 weeks my mom has vomited in the middle of the night 6 different nights (spread out about once per week).   The vomit is very close to dark brown but not quite and is 100% liquid.   There is no diarrhea and bowel movements as normal.  She usually has her last meal around 3:00pm and maybe a snack around 5:30pm and is in bed by 7:00pm falling asleep pretty quick.   Dad has her propped up pretty good on pillows.   He called the her PCP after the first time and he prescribed anti nausea meds to desolve under tongue and bland diet.   Med wont work because she doesnt understand and chews it.   During these weeks she still seemed to be in good spirits.  She is not holding her stomach or showing any signs of being in pain.  This past week mom threw up overnight and also during the day.  She did not eat anything all day and barely had anything to drink.  Dad called the PCP next day and again said bland diet.  I told him to give her plenty Pedialite and lemonade.   So now for the past 5 days she has not been eating very much or drinking much.   Dad says her Depends are not very wet.  She has a physical schedule in two weeks so dad wants to wait until then to talk to the Dr more.  She did have her pre physical blood work completed today.  He has been writing this all down and will show the Dr then.     I guess my question is is this a normal progression of the disease?  Im very concerned now that she is refusing food and drinks.  I love my mom so much and hate that she has this disease.  I know the decline is inevitable but I'm just not ready for it!!  Thank you very much in advance for any and all comments.  And again so sorry for this being so long.",False,Jen A,2015-07-26,8.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147529866,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'm glad I did because I've been stressing over how will we ""know"" if my Mom is at the very end. Mom has been dealing with dementia signs/symptoms for years now. Only in the last year has she declined rapidly. She is presently at home with home health aids hospice and my Dad. My Dad is her primary caregiver and advocate. I live about an hour away from them and for the last year I've driven up once a week and stayed for the day. There were times that I would stay overnight a few times to help my Dad. I have a husband and two young boys so juggling my family and being there for Mom and Dad is difficult but I'm making it work. It's the least I can do. This time last year she was walking with a cane verbal and able to stay by herself a little bit. Fast forward to today and she is completely immobile weight has plummeted barely talking/eating sleeping all the time hallucinations and pain. Also pleurisy was diagnosed a month ago. She was a lifelong smoker up until 10 months ago. Last week was the first time she didn't recognize me. It broke my heart. As I drove home I kept thinking that it might have been the last time I see her. But I don't want it to be like that. I want to be there. I want to be there when she passes. I want to be there for my Dad. I know there's no crystal ball to tell me exactly when the end will come but are there physical signs? Does anyone have advice? I've spent the last year saying good-bye to my Mom to the person she was and its made me angry frustrated pissed-off and most of all heartbreakingly sad. I really want to be there holding her hand.   I hope I haven't rambled on incessantly. I don't talk much about this except with family.

She fell but didn't hurt anything that anyone could see or determine. Obviously my mother couldn't say if she had pain.  The next day Friday my sister contacted me late day indicating my mother was very very agitated.  My sister had hired an additional caregiver to spend time with my mom at the center and between both of them neither could settle her down. My sister called her doctor who is the official physician for the center.  He suggested to my sister to place my mother for the week-end in the local hospital psyche unit.  Then transfer her the following Monday to a geriatric psyche unit in another town to help get her meds back on track.  I had previously learned that my mother had lost 30 lbs since she was admitted and hadn't been eating or drinking much in the past month.  I suggested my sister contact the local hospice for palliative care assistance earlier she chose not to.  My sister had contacted other family members to see if we were ok moving my mom twice to psyche units.  Some were ok with that decision.  I was not.  I contacted a nurse practitioner friend who worked for hospice previously.  She suggested my mother was possibly experiencing 'terminal agitation' and to contact hospice.  I indicated this to my sister and hospice was contacted.  They came out and evaluated my mother's needs and moved her to their local hospice center NOT the hospital psyche ward.  4 days later my mom passed away.  Hospice was terrific in her final days.  Keeping her comfortable and allowing the dying process to take place on its own.    The thought that the doctor suggested a psyche unit was truly troubling to me.  I knew my mother was coming to the end of her life just based on the facts my sister was telling me.  I have been around my share of death bed good-byes to know she was dying.  I know the right decision was made placing her in hospice care.  I'm shocked a doctor wouldn't recognize terminal agitation and the body slowly shutting down.  Has anyone else experienced a similar situation?  Just curious if this is common or uncommon.,False,NCdistantdaughter,2016-05-19,10.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147529141,,,AlzConnected,,,

When the ambulance came to get her she was not talking or responding to any questions.  I thought she was just angry about having to go somewhere.  I drove separately and arrived at the ortho only to be told that the ambulance had turned around at taken her to the hospital.  She was in what may be called a 'catatonic' state.  She did not respond to commands or to pain.  After 1 night in the hospital she began to come around and had a good day yesterday with no problems.  Today however she's having hallucinations and believes that people are coming into her house and taking things selling furniture holding an auction and trying to take her house away.  We kept reminding her she was in the hospital for a broken knee but she still saw people carrying her couch out. She also said she saw little children taking her drinking cup.  Could the trauma from the fall have caused this decline?  and more importantly:  My brother thinks that she will be turned away from rehab to help her walk because of her altered mental status.  I know that I can not bring her home and deal with her needs alone.  I can't lift her and I can't even turn her over by myself.

She started displaying (as I call them  'seeing things' or 'alternate realities' ) around 5-6 yrs ago. We initially attributed it to (which can happen) her glaucoma going blind in one eye as well as (also can happen) UTI's and sadly bad reaction to strong medicines as 'strong' as tamaflu and codeine 3 and the 'latest/greatest' fetanyl patch the past 8 weeks for bone on bone pain. (totally not for that) but I get it...painfree vs. 'being loopy'. Prior to the patch (3-4 months) she started exhibiting more regular 'alternate realities' - it was overcoming her becoming her new normal losing interest in the things she loved. Well she ended up in the hospital for what I call an overdose of the fetanyl patch (really bad so scary); the good news ...they got her off the patch the bad news they put her in TCU one week ago 2-night and in less than a week - they transferred her to the permanent memory care unit. I mean I get it at least my head does my heart is breaking....it's so hard. You see my Mom and I had a very volatile relationship my whole adult life and one year ago I 'resigned' as her Caregiver I couldn't take her verbal abuse anymore. I was burnt out. Thank God our relationship was restored in less than two months and things have never been better for us. I thinks that's why I'm grieving....I want my Mom back. I tell myself... at least she still knows me and I know she is safe now... but....    She still doesn't know she isn't coming home they haven't told her yet. It's so sad. I'm very fortunate I have a great support system; but I'm still so sad.

We have been keeping her condo empty and paying the monthly bills for the past year and a half.  This is not sustainable but it's taken me awhile to come to terms with either renting the condo out or selling it.  I am an only child and do have DPOA for medical and finances.  A relative is going to rent the condo so we have cleaned it out and are preparing it for her to move in.  Today I get a phone call from mom.  Her well meaning male ""friend"" just got there and promptly told her that we were emptying her house out.  She was angry and wanted to know what is going on.  I told her a half truth - we had to get the furniture out as we were getting the carpets cleaned.  She seemed okay with that but I am going to visit her later tonight and don't know what to do or say.  This ""friend"" has told her upsetting things in the past including that I told him that she has Alzheimer's.  His first wife died with Alzheimer's so it seems like he would understand this disease but he doesn't seem to.  In the past he's pressured her about when she's coming home.  The incident with telling her about Alzheimer's resulted in a week long tirade of bouncing back and forth between uncontrollable crying and extreme anger including phone calls to anyone in her phone contacts demanding that they come and take her home - anytime of the day or night.  He also has reported to her that someone was living there (not true) when we'd accidentally left a light on at the condo.  Again this upset her immensely.  I'm at a loss as to how to handle this.  She has anosognosia and vehemently denies that there is anything wrong with other. I was considering telling her that her niece's daughter needed someplace to live and we thought it be okay for her to stay there as long as mom was at the facility. But she probably would forget and this concern may come up repeatedly.  Part of me wants to tell her the truth - she's not going home.  But I want to avoid pain for her whenever possible.  I'm sorry for the long post but I'm looking for support/ideas about how to handle this.

Recently I found a hard patch of skin on her buttocks. It does not pain or otherwise bother her but it concerns me especially now that it has changed from flat and hard to hard with raised bumps. She throws a fit any time a doctor or nurse tries to take a look at her and only rarely lets me help her shower which is the only time I get a good look at things. The patch was about the size of a silver dollar. It may be slightly wider now I'm not sure but again the skin is raised now where it was even with the other surface skin before. There is no redness scaling pimpling itching or other sign of a traditional diaper rash. There is just this weird skin/flesh that feels hard instead of responding to touch like normal skin/flesh. It feels almost like there is a piece of plastic embedded in this spot on her butt. Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Please advise!  Also we could use advise on diapering: i.e. should we be giving her powder or vaseline or other lotion? What can we do to make her more comfortable and to protect her skin?

Long story short - discovered an aggressive cancerous tumor in her throat. She also has a lesion on her lung and it has spread to her lymph nodes.  She was moved to hospice yesterday.  I have been staying with her almost 24/7 except to come home and shower and take care of a few things.  My husband has also been there most of the time and there when I run home.  He has been coming home to sleep.  You really have to be there all the time.  Now that she is in hospice it will be a little easier.  Even though her chart says she has ALZ  the staff would constantly take what she says at face value.  Things like Did you have a good lunch?  Yes (reality drank 2 sips of apple juice and 1 bite of jello) Can you stand up and go to the bathroom Yes (No she has been incontinent for awhile and she is very weak) Any pain? Always says no( Two minutes before said her back and throat hurt.) Any coughing (Always no) Coughed for 30 minutes after meds. Reminding them meds must be crushed and given only a few drops of liquid at a time. And on and on  This morning in hospice my husband and I stepped out to talk for less than 10 minutes.  I came in and she was alone drinking orange juice from a straw.  She had a swallow scan done. She can't use a straw any more. It gives her too much liquid and the orange juice coming back up will hurt.  She has to be supervised when she drinks anything.  Even when she gets something down it sits somewhere in her throat and can return up to 1/2 hour later.  She can't use thickeners or apple sauce.  Clear liquids only.  I realize not all patients have a large tumor in their throat but each has unique needseven more so a patient with Alzheimer's.  I haven't even gone into her confusion that the hospital room is her new apartment and people keep coming in and bothering her. Meds may be discontinued but we are a bit scared given her hospitalization several weeks ago for behavior issues (trying to choke an aid.)  Her attitude has been great she is enjoying having me there all the time and looking forward to her other son and her daughter coming.  I have been to busy to grieve There is no time for that now.  This is not a criticism of the staff at all they have been great.  My MIL does not appear confused most of the time.  But with the change of shifts and multiple staff members doing different jobs a family member has to be vigilant.,False,KellyJ,2014-05-07,270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147529320,,,AlzConnected,,,
676,62105dec7b65de9a5b666a9e,2147529545,2016-10-15 09:42:00,The long hard journey to placement-retrospective,"Today I am putting all of my Dad's records in my attic for storage for the next 7 years.  I am tired of opening my drawers and getting hit in the face with the 9 binders of documentation; there was plenty of paperwork to keep during his long journey.  It's time to remove what I can to spare me any unecessary pain; lord knows there's enough of that without a paper trail of evidence.    Mostly for me but perhaps for some who are just beginning this road a few short excerpts from my notebook which helped me sort things out when we were trying to figure out what was wrong with Dad and how we got to placement.  I lived 2 hrs. away had 2 local siblings. Skip to the bottom if you find this tedious for a few retrospective tips.    2008  OMG what the hell is wrong with him?  It's only been 3 weeks since I saw Mom but she looks like she is dying!  Skeletal confused refusing to go to the doctor.  Dad just sits there laughing saying ""you won't recognize her"".  My head has a hatchet through my frontal lobe I can't think.  My little boy only 4  just looks at me and asks ""Mommy why is grandma so skinny?""  We get to the MD who looks at me disapprovingly (when I can understand what she is saying through her heavy accent).  I sit on the floor of the exam room and play Ba Ba Black Sheep with my little guy while Mom sits ranting on the exam table.  I am going to throw up.    Back at home I receive the barbs and screaming of the brothers.  Yes I failed I should have taken her to the emergency room.  But I had my son and she wouldn't cooperate - why was I looking for her consent when she was out of her mind?  I suppose I deserve the tongue lashing.  But I was there they were not.  They will deal with it tomorrow.    2009  We have a real problem with Dad.  Today I watched in my rear view mirror as he poured all the home made soup and stew I had just delivered down the drain in the front of the house; it took me hours to get the food ready with the kids running around.  He refuses to wash I think his arm is broken and he won't go to the MD.  He got agitated and started yelling when I tried to take him to the ER the kids got frightened and ran outside.  He smells sooooo bad the kids won't go near him.  The washing machine is broken and he won't allow a new one; he is urinating on himself and just throwing his underwear soaked with urine in the dryer. I can't believe my brother wouldn't make time next week to take Dad to the doctor - ""too busy"".  5 hours round trip for me 10 minutes down the road for him.  This is not going to work; but I really don't want to get stuck with this.  There are 2 of them within 20 minutes; 1 of me out of state with babies.  Seriously?  2010  It finally happened - the catastrophic event - Dad is asking for me in the ER.  2 hour drive to get there; he's asking for me. ONLY ME.  I have become that woman the successor to his mother and his wife the one who always took care of him.   The guide.  Crap.    ______  It became clear during my Dad's hospitalization and stay at rehab. that he was as the neuropsychologist put it ""challenging.""  Uncooperative for therapy many days obsessive with many things anxiety out of control and up at night. Wandering the neighborhood; dumpster diving.  Still refusing to wash.      One day he said to me ""I could come live with you.""  I froze; I had prepared for this moment why couldn't I talk or speak?  So many sleepless nights but so convinced it was the correct path to pursue.  Don't start crying yet NOT now.        And so I said my carefully well phrased well rehearsed statement with a big smile and my hand on his arm:  ""I would love to Daddy but we have stairs.  Stairs are hard for you.  Winter is coming and I do want you close by so I am bringing you near my house to get stronger until Spring.  You don't want to slip on ice at home and you don't need the headache of stairs right?  Dad nodded accepted my hug and I told him I would meet him the next day.  He was going to have a ride in a car where he could lay down and sleep the whole time and then he would see me.  We would have a tasty lunch together and even dessert.   I managed to choke that lunch down even had a few bites of the frosted cake they served.  Dad asked when I would be back seemed satisfied at my answer and then I tucked him in bed to watch TV. He barely noticed when I left.  Thank God.  It seemed as long as he had TV and good food he was not going to object.  At least that part is easy.  I went out to my car and sobbed - but only for 10 minutes.  I had to get home to get the kids off the school bus.    ______________________________  For anyone considering placement please realize that what you feel as guilt is really recognizing that the enormity of the situation exceeds ones ability to provided the needed care for both your LO with dementia and yourself an your family; it is regret.  It only becomes guilt when we don't think everything through to realize it was a rational decision and stop at the emotional tidal wave that often hits us.  My mantra is care needs drive the decision making.  Some can provide those at home others cannot.  The ability to meet those care needs can vary greatly by situation dementia presentation and individual.  There is nothing at all to feel shameful about if your conclusion is that you cannot provide the care yourself.  This week I read a  rather negative and sarcastic response from someone on the boards who chose to use quotation marks around the word ""placed"".  It stung me.  The word place suggests a careful deliberate effort.  At best it clearly indicated no insight whatsoever into what is involved in being the responsible party for a LO who is living in a facility.  For those who are in agony over it I encourage you to make a check list journal or pros and cons list to help you see the way to good decision making for your situation.  The hindsight lessons?  1.  Certified Elder Law Attorney (www.nelf.org) will get you the information and documentation you need accurately and help you plan.  They may even be able to get your resistant elder through counseling to realize how IMPERATIVE a Power of Attorney is.  2.  Geriatric Psychiatrist- the absolute GO TO professional for anxiety documentation of competency (need for proxy) and management of all dementia related behaviors that need addressing.  Be aware:  GP's are frequently reluctant to refer.  Insist.  3.  In Neverland?  GP telling you Dad might be OK but you know something is wrong?  See a neurologist (MD) as well as a PhD neuropsychologist.  The MD will diagnose dementia accurately to determine course of disease and possible treatment - the PhD does test of function for areas of deficit.  Very valuable especially if every other MD is blowing you off!  4.  I should have stopped looking for the ""OK"" the agreement of my parent way earlier that I did.  It is hard to let go of ""usual"" of ""how things should be"" but the reality of it is this is a person with a very broken reasoner who is completely and totally unable to help himself.  Both of my parents care suffered because of my late arrival to this conclusion.    Lastly a GREAT read is Roz Chast's ""Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?"".  Cartoons that demonstrate her eldercare journey in a humerous way with many points that will make you realize you are not alone in your sometimes bizarre feelings along the elder care journey.            http://projects.newyorker.com/story/chast-parents/",False,King Boo,2012-01-09,3593.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147529545,,,AlzConnected,,,

The surgery itself was very difficult because of the extent of damage inflammation and bone spurs--however--IT WAS A SUCCESS!  While normally a same day surgery mom was kept for 2-night observation.  Because she had to be monitored 24/7 to keep the sling/brace in place the hospital allowed both of us to stay with her the entire time.  Coming out from under the anesthesia she was confused and very agitated until it wore off.  The first 12 days or so were extremely difficult--she continued to be very combative and constantly agitated.  She constantly refused her medication in the hospital but we were always able to gently coax her into cooperation.  When we got home she refused all meds food and drink for nearly 24 hours (holiday weekend--hard to reach any help).  We began to crush her meds and put them in her Ensure (which she loves and sees as a treat).  Mom continued to be very agitated and combative and would not sleep for days--even though she was on all her regular meds plus a sedative and an added anxiety med.  Mom denied any pain at all so we cut way down on her (as needed) pain med--which was a HUGE mistake.  She directed all her energy at trying to take off the sling/brace that must stay on 24/7 for 6 weeks.  It turned out that her not sleeping agitation and combativeness was because of the extreme pain that she couldn't acknowledge or express.  Once we put her back on her pain med schedule she has been doing relatively as well as can be expected under the circumstances.  We are expecting an acceptable recovery and a great benefit from having had the surgery.  Although we still have 3 weeks to try to keep her in the sling/brace and 3-4 months of physical therapy things are much better and definitely looking up.  She was able to move from the recliner chair for sleeping into her bed and is much more comfortable and cooperative.  Although at one point it seemed like we were losing this battle and all stuck in a horrible nightmare we all made it through the hardest part of it all.  This was a huge learning experience for us and will hopefully help someone facing surgery.  I will never again schedule surgery right before a holiday or when the doctor will be leaving town after the surgery.  Also with AD patients I will NEVER believe that they are not in pain when they should be. I understand that medical procedures for AD patients definitely require an informed approach.  Thank you to everyone who encouraged us and tried to prepare us ahead of the surgery.,False,Armondo,2015-12-18,89.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147529053,,,AlzConnected,,,
679,62105e2b7b65de9a5b666c05,2147528670,2016-08-28 15:37:00,Medicare? Hospice? LTD Benefits?,Hi all.  I’ve posted a few times before but mostly just “lurk”.  I’ve been taking care of mom in her home for over three years with the help of caregivers but now it’s apparent I can no longer provide all the help she needs. It was my hope to keep her at home thru ought the duration of this illness. We private pay for care during the day because I own a business that takes a great deal of my time.  Honestly taking care of her and my business has been all consuming leaving me with time for nothing else. Mom is in solid stage 6 and declining very rapidly and has started wandering wanting to go home even though she’s in her home of 35 years.  Here’s the kicker:  She has a fantastic Long Term Disability policy that now pays up to $5000 per month for a nursing home for the rest of her life. She set this up after the burden of her mother my grandmother became after debilitating strokes that caused her to be bed bound for several years. She had no dementia whatsoever. My mother wanted to spare us the same if that happened to her. I don't think she ever anticipated or even knew anything about Alzheimer's disease when she did this. She grew up in a time when they locked people away against their will when mentally unstable and has always had a fear of that happening to her and I made the promise to never let that happen to her. I don't want to debate weather a lock down memory care facility qualifies or not because we have to do something. She is 86 years old.  I’m in discussions with the LTD company on providing benefits for in home care vs a nursing home but so far it doesn't look promising. However $5000 a month would pay for a hell of a lot of in home care and with myself included it would be doable.. I need to buy some time with getting this resolved with the LTD company one way or the other.  She also has back problems that she aggravates from time to time. She recently did something that aggravated her back and literally couldn't move or get out of bed she was in so much pain. She has compressed disks in her back. We decided to call an ambulance and have her taken to the ER. She spent four days there and had a procedure called Vertoplasty where they inject a cement like substance to fuse the disks in her back.  It was my hope that the Dr would release her to a skilled nursing facility for rehab while we looked at all options available to us and she has to be in a SNF for 90 days before her LTD benefits will kick in. Well the hospital admitted her as “observation only” which means she doesn't quality for SNF under medicare.  I tried to fight that ruling with no luck.  Sorry for the long post. Here’s my question: What benefits are there under medicare that would buy me some time to get things resolved? Would Hospice allow a 5 day respite under medicare? I read on the medicare web site they would pay for that. Are there any other benefits under medicare (or Hospice) that we could use to place her somewhere very short term or provide in home care for a brief period while we get things resolved? Although she has daytime caregivers as I stated there was not continuous supervision which I feel she must have now. She has limited funds and we use all her SS money to pay for these caregivers. Plus I need some time to visit places should we have to place her.  This stuff with medicare is all new to me (not the dementia part) and I don't know what to do?   Thanks for any help you can provide!  Wally!

680,62105e407b65de9a5b666c6d,2147527390,2016-06-24 18:53:00,Seeking info regarding LTC insurance thresholds,My mom has what looks like a very good policy. The threshold for activation is for a policy written in the late 90's rather standard I believe - (a) needs help with 2 basic ADLs OR (b) needs continual supervision due to cognitive impairment. That's not verbatim but close. I am trying to map out best and worst case scenarios for financing her progression through the disease and it would help to have a better sense of how long I might have to finance her care prior to LTC insurance kicking in. So one question I am hoping for some insights on is how bad does it have to get before an insurance company (Genworth in this case) would agree that my mom qualifies under the continual supervision provision. Or the inability to perform 2 basic ADLs? Is the threshold for one more often reached than the other? My mom has chronic back pain seems increasingly frail and has a significant memory impairment but is otherwise healthy (i.e. no heart problems organ problems generally has not needed to go to a doctor ever and nothing other than that which I just mentioned was noted when I recently DID get her to go to a doctor) not incontinent or anything like that.  I would judge her to be transitioning from stage 4 to 5 in the 7 stage model. One webpage which describes those stages (https://www.alzinfo.org/understand-alzheimers/clinical-stages-of-alzheimers/) indicates an average of 2 years in stage 4 and 1.5 years for stage 5. Is it reasonable to expect that at least on average LTC insurance would kick in not too long after stage 6 is reached (which might mean we would need to pay for assisted living [which I am hoping to get her in soon] for 3 or 4 years.

She is in a private nursing home in a memory care unit and her behaviors are becoming more combative paranoid and aggressive. Especially when the CNAs bathe or dress her. She is becoming more aggressive towards other residents and can be a feisty pest because she can't verbalize her thoughts and emotions. The staff at the nursing home just held a family meeting with me and my sisters and suggested antipsychotics meds and pain management. We just had an appointment with her Neurologist and he told us about the meds being classified as black box warnings and impose side effects such as stroke dizziness and  Increased risk of falls and fractures.     As a family we decided to try her on a low dose of the meds  they haven't started yet but the more I research these meds the more I feel sick to my stomach and don't know if we are making the right or best choices for her. It's been so heart wrenching watching her rapid decline and we pray she doesn't suffer much longer. But what's the alternatives? Dope her up to keep her calm and risk her suffering a stroke? Which is worse? These are the hardest most stressful choices to make. She has always been such a sweet loving kind soul and even though this disease has taken her mind it hasn't touched her heart.. Even through her rapid decline she still can express love and affection. I love you is one of the only things she can still verbalize clearly. I don't want her to suffer anymore. I want her to be at peace .         So I guess I was wondering if anyone can give me any insight about similar experiences? Alternatives? Suggestions?

I moved home for 6 months to help my father care for her as she recovered from the stroke. She's improved physically but her short-term memory and judgement are greatly affected and she's now confusing her long-term memories doesn't know what month it is (knows the year) misplaces items is paranoid and accuses us of treating her like a prisoner. The only thing she can't do is drive (and we offer to take her anywhere anytime) but not being able to drive has stripped her of her independence. I'm trying to figure out how to keep her safe yet happy and could  your insight/suggestions based on your experiences.    Following her stroke she was hospitalized for over a month and initially received ST/PT/OT then only outpatient PT which we have since stopped because she is resistant to going (her right foot still drags and she has a weak ankle). She has a brace she refuses to wear and a cane we have to insist she uses when we leave the house. We  have locked up her meds (and car keys) because she can't manage them herself (every day she insists she's never taken these medications before; we've also found her sneaking meds she had before the stroke thinking they were pain pills) and we (and the doctor) do not think she should drive (poor judgement memory loss slow reactions and right foot isn't 100%). She recently (in 100 degree weather) left the house (while my father was taking a nap) and returned a couple hours later...she decided to walk to a graveyard and back after which she began vomiting (most likely due to the heat).    Although she has some good days the bad days seem to outweigh the good (or we are still trying to figure our way through this disease). Most recently she had a melt down because we wouldn't give her the car keys. She decided she wanted to leave but  we blocked the doors followed her into the backyard to convince her to come in. We took her cell phone because she wanted to call the police and we fear that if she does that we may need to proceed with activating our Durable Powers of Attorney which we don't want to do. I actually slept on the couch for fear that she may get up in the middle of the night and walk out the door (she didn't).    Our main concern is her safety (ensuring she doesn't fall have an accident wander off etc.). She thinks the stroke has ""disappeared"" doesn't understand why we are trying to help her when she doesn't need help. Although difficult to hear her anger accusations etc. we understand it's the dementia; however it makes it very difficult to keep her safe and try and figure out how to make her happy.     Any suggestions about how to handle the driving issue ensure she doesn't wander off what to make sure she has if she does wander (she won't wear a bracelet)? Also has anyone successfully set-up a security system with silent alarms to alert you to open doors? Any ideas on how to convince her to wear a brace (when she goes outside) or use the cane?

My heart is just breaking every day to see him wasting away.  I can't see living without him.  We have had 63-1/2 wonderful years together.  He has been my life and without him I don't think I can go on.  I can't do anything to keep him from dying either.  Hospice has a social worker that I can call at any time but I just haven't called because in my heart I think that I can heal him--think I am losing my mind.  I know that 88 years is a long lifetime and I am thankful for that.  I am 81 and not in good health.  What can I do to get over these feelings of dread and fear?  Recently I can't even pray and ask God for help.  My mind is just so focused on wanting him to live.   He is a sweet kind and caring man truly a Southern gentleman has not one time been hard to get along with even in the face of Alzheimer's.,False,Anna-81,2016-09-08,46.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147528926,,,AlzConnected,,,

Week 3... 18 (currently in this week) and Week 4 28mg.  After this point the neurologist plan is for her to move to a 2 in 1 (Namenda and Arocept).        Let me caveat that our Neurologist was highly recommended and we are very comfortable with her experience and true determination to get down to what is going on (dementia-wise).  I currently live in Maryland and plan on relocating my mother out here to us and the grand kids.  My sister is currently living with her and about to go to college so we want to make sure she has the support of family.    Tonight I received a phone call from my sister that my mother today experienced a spell in which she was confused on where she was and wanted to go home... this is the first time this has ever happened and took my sister by surprise.  She kept stating she was not at her house and even attempted to leave and wanted to call a cab until my sister calmed her down.  Again this was an eye opener because she has never done this and my sister said it subsided and she was comfortable again within an hour after she realized the event.  She even was a bit upset with herself and said she felt dumb for the incident.  Does anyone have any experience with the gradual increases during the initial doses of Namenda... is this something as a side effect that is just part of dosage increases over 4 weeks??  Currently she is diagnosed with early dementia but not an Alzheimer's?  What am I missing here they can tell me its not Alzheimer's but they can't tell me yet whether this is vascular or any of the other forms?  So right now we are playing it by ear and making sure we get appointments scheduled as soon as possible.  Tomorrow I will be calling her neurologist to give a rundown of todays events and see what she thinks.  But it was something tonight as we've never seen that from her.    Thanks for listening.,False,cheseapeake_ron,2016-06-19,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147528402,,,AlzConnected,,,

However I remember that many on the boards were beginning to explore hospice.  I do recommend that you go directly to learn about hospice from the people that provide hospice services directly.  There is a SHOCKINGLY  large amount of inaccuracies out there and can come from physicians and even current trusted care staff.  Their mis information can hurt your loved ones care.    There can even be mis-information between levels of hospice care - i.e. in home and inpatient hospice care.  The advocacy does not end even when the dying has begun.  A good hospice situation is priceless and will be your lifeline as your loved one passes.  What did I most learn?  Natural death can be uncomfortable; painful.  Once active dying has begun there is NO TIME WHATSOEVER to obtain what your loved one needs via the traditional medical system.  You will be out of your mind with distress. Even if you have hospiceyou will be out of your mind with distress but there will be some relief knowing you had access to the best end of life care possible.    The signs of pain and discomfort are very subtle; you need trained eyes to see it.  A hospice nurse can perceive tone change in positioning a minor brow furrow - and realize it is a pain indicator.  Your day to day care staff or yourself would not notice it.    Interview your hospice agency well; get educated; get comfortable with your nursing home's staff implementation of hospice treatment; explore dedicated inpatient hospice units in case of need.  Realize as in most of this dementia journey you may have to explore get educated initiate advocate.  Do not rely heavily on your PCP; hospice most unfortunately is an after thought an add on a maybe to many physicians.  The earlier hospice is on board the better.

My mom is not doing too well so I figured I'd pop in to say hi and see if anyone has input.  She ended up living with us for a year but at the end she required 24 hour care. We placed her in a nursing home and she has been rapidly declining. She is very confused and if she remembers anything she is usually in 1982. Oddly she remembered my son who is 15 so I guess there's no reasoning with this disease. In the last few months she has lost close to 20 pounds so her 5'9"" frame is carrying around 100lbs now instead of the 145 she was years ago. They now have her on two Ensure drinks a day but the doctor said there's not much else we can do... it's the disease. She also falls a lot and is in the chronic UTI phase.   The worst part for me when she was here and for the staff has been her colostomy bag. She doesn't recognize it as being familiar so she will remove and hide it up to 6-8 times a day. For a while she was having problems with combative physical behavior and was throwing poop and punching the staff. This also happened here at home.  After a one week psych stay her meds were all changed and she seems better except of course for not knowing who/where she is.    Based on her body's inability to take in nutrition from her food the UTI's not being able to care for herself at all the falls etc... I'm guessing we are at stage 7.  I wish I knew how much longer she has.  Its very painful for me to go see her and she cries each time we leave even though I'm not sure she realizes who I am. There is no quality of life for her now. I don't think she's in any pain but the nurse that I spoke to yesterday said she has really declined a lot in the last month.   I guess any advice you have would be appreciated. Someone on a facebook group suggested I get ready to contact Hospice but I'm not sure at what point you do that plus I'm unsure how that works in the nursing home setting.   Thanks and hoping everyone is doing well.

Newbie here just needing to vent some and would welcome suggestions support anything at this point. My mom has vascular dementia and I was unexpectedly at least to me put in the position of caregiver. She and I have always been the best of friends and it has been heart rending to watch as the perceptive brilliant professional woman I admired and depended on for so many years has slipped away a piece at a time. I never thought I would be answering the same question 10 times in 5 minutes. Not with her. My dad died about five years ago and my best friend died unexpectedly a little over a year ago. My brother who lives far away about 14 hour drive  has done nothing to help except tell me how bad a job I'm doing with mom and running the household. Now he is not even communicating with us at all. Her professional friends tried to help out but being disturbed by seeing her decline they have also said they can offer no support that it is up to her family which right now is only me. I have been disabled for most of my adult life I live in chronic pain from crippling bone spur growth in my spine and massive degeneration of the cartilage in my ribcage. Every breath is painful. I have asked every public agency I know of for assistance but am told that we do not qualify because things aren't bad enough here. APS is the only agency who has come out here and their solution is to get the hous professionally cleaned and de cluttered by an agency that we can't afford to pay. Yeah right!? I was also born with only one kidney and because of medication use for pain over the years I now have renal disease. Last week my gp told me that according to blood tests my kidney is now beginning to get gradually worse and since I am not a candidate for dialysis or transplant there is nothing the nephrologist I'm seeing can do but tell me how long I have left to live. I was never able to have children and when engaged to be married my fiancé died so I have no family of my own. Now all my energy is spent keeping my mom oriented eating regularly and on her medications and driving her to doctors appointments. I used to have so many hopes and dreams for my own life but now I feel I have nothing for myself I just have to keep her going as long as I can. I don't even have the energy to emotionally process my impending death or anything else about my own situation. This may sound selfish to many of you who do such an admirable job caring for your own loved ones and if that is the case I apologize. I have nothing but admiration for those in this situation who face it with much more grace and strength than I am able to. I'm so very very tired and the toxins building up in my blood and brain are making it more difficult for me to deal with stress which is very common among renal disease patients. I don't know how much longer I can keep going physically or emotionally with no support from anyone. I'm frightened of what the future holds for us both. I was born with multiple creative talents for art costume design writing music but have not been able to pursue any of these things with any success. Now they seem like nothing more than a dim memory to me. I don't know how to face this life anymore but still keep dragging on at a very high cost. Anything vaguely familiar to anyone about anything I've said?  Thank you to anyone who was able to stomach this enough to read this far. I just feel like I have failed at everything in my life and am continuing to fail now. The guilt is overwhelming. For those of you who are succeeding at being good caregivers very well done! It's so much harder than most people realize. So that's me as pitiful as I am. Thank you for any kind thoughts or prayers if you feel them. It would mean so much!

701,621060787b65de9a5b66787b,2147527591,2016-07-04 10:54:00,Food For Thought,I don't read or respond here much any more so I thought I would drop by with some reminders of things think bout when caring for some one dementia.    For those who do no know me I am a daughter who has been the sole caregiver my mother for the last 10 years...an I was recently diagnosed with young onset dementia late into the progression of the disease.  So I have a bit of perspective from both ends the spectrum.   AGITATION AN PACING:  It is very common in dementia that we get agitated an start pacing or wanting go home.  I am sure most of you have seen that.  I also experience that...so I can tell you what is behind it...which I hope will help you in handling an dealing with it when it happens for you.    As our brain breaks down...the part our brain that processes pain hunger or other body senstations breaks...but our hard wiring stays.  The best example I have is if you an I hold our hands over a flame - you will get 2 sensations.  1 that you hand hot.  And 2 the hard-wired intense need get away.  Now because you brain has both sensations...it can realize that only you hand needs get away.  I will no have that.  I will just get fidgety an need leave.  Which will progress look like pacing or a rationalizing of I need get out of here this no home - I need go home.    It could be anything.  I could be hot or cold...or need pee...or be hungry...or a big culprit I could be in pain.    Please please please...do no lie us or take us round the block...please please please - see after our needs.  Check if we hot or cold or hungry or need potty...or in pain.    Pain is often UNDER-medicated in dementia patients. So when in doubt try a pain med.    AGRESSION:  As our brain breaks down...our ability communicate does as well.  We may be able hold pleasant conversations...but this does no mean we can address negative things with any skill or savy.  What you likely encounter is instant rage.    Now it is true...dementia an Alzheimer's rage CAN turn deadly.    But that brings us round another point...ok yes some things we no going like you caring for us...but it should no be everything all the time.  If this the situation - place us as you simply are no the person care for us.    As the disease progresses we are 100% reactionary.  Meaning...how you come at us will 100% determine how we respond you.  If you can no fix this you self do us both a favor - place us. Or watch Teepa Snow videos youtube.    Point is do no make us miserable all the time - that hell.    OVER STIMULATION:  We will get worse agitated aggressive if OVER STIMULATED...especially in the evenings.  In dealing with my own dementia an because this a HUGE issue me living with my grandbaby...I think the old motto: KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).    Declutter the environment.  Keep noise a minimum.  Soft music might help you...but in dementia brain it is just one more stimulus hurting the brain.  Keep voices kind warm an loving.     Maybe don't talk us in evenings if this a problem us.  My poor daughter get so excited talk me in evenings.  An I want talk with her as well.  But as soon as she open her mouth it like pin pricks my brain.  It actually hurt the sound her voice.  I have keep tell her no talk me.  This hurt her feelings.  But I am climbing out of my skin in the evenings.    Maybe have a quiet room that can be a retreat for you loved one.  A place they can go sit in silence an quiet while you prepare dinner an talk with family as they getting home.  It would be a welcome space an time both you.    I used write better this subject.    FORGETTING:  Of course we forget names an labels we have dementia - duh!  So stop asking us.  That is the quickest way blank our brain.  It is humiliating for us...an it kills us that it breaks you heart.  Stop making it mean anything - we still get who you are even long after we forget you name.  Just love us an we will love you right back.    Hope that helps.    Oh...yes also...please stop think you job is soooo hard.  It might be personally weird awkward uncomfortable...but that you baggage not us...or no the job.  Raising kids no picnic either...an I am infinitely easier care for than my toddler grandbaby who into everything and real hard get a diaper on her!  We don't complain that caring for our babies is so bad because after all it is what we do - care for them.  Same thing with parents spouces loved ones - it is JUST WHAT WE DO FOR EACH OTHER.    Try stop seeing it as thankless as well...a person with dementia is as grateful have a good day as you are win the lottery...we just have lost ability say it.  You can make us beam an almost purr - in ways that will have be the light in you day.  I do get this I have cared my mom 10 years...an what keeps me going is I know that she ultimately really would no like be a nursing home so even if she no say it - I know it.  That it the right thing do...that what keeps me going.  Find that light an live IN it.  When doubts creep in seek that light gain.   I firmly believe that caring for someone Alzheimer's dementia does no need be hard or sad...that we can have great lives gether.  An I also firmly believe that we can have good end of lives an deaths as well.  It takes an understanding an acceptance that this is what this ultimately leads towards an a willingness no prolong our lives or deaths.  Dementia can cause a nice quiet peaceful death.    Granted everyone's situations are different...but it helps have a picture an goal in mind as you assess where you are now an where you ultimately like be caring you loved one...that helps navaigate a straight path from here there.    Much Love Hang In There EVERYONE.  &lt;3,False,The_Sun_Still_Rises,2015-07-24,3020.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147527591,,,AlzConnected,,,

My brother has DS he's 43 and my youngest sibling. I have not been on this site since August 2014 and of course so much has happened. I'm reconnecting because my brother is getting more lost in this disease that I need to start reaching outside of myself to talk to those that understand.  There's so much of him ""here"" with me still but the changes have been enough that he needs more care. It became clear to me this holiday weekend that my brother is wandering off in public spaces and needs a constant companion. He's not leaving the house yet not sure when to prepare for that. I have started him on a bathroom schedule; he's not incontinent but he forgets that he's already used it or feels like he needs to but doesn't. We have to remove the bathroom tissue because he keeps his soiled tissue in his pocket and cuts it up at a later time when he's alone.  I've stopped working in order to be home with him when he arrives back from Day Services. I must gently ask to check pockets his shoes and his bag to remove all trash that he tries to bring home to cut. We provide him with much paper but he wants food trash. We stopped allowing all food boxes/items from his ""stockpile"" when the bugs came in and then the spiders moved in to eat the bugs!  My brother has become more sentimental towards me and ""misses me"" when I'm gone. He likes knowing I'm here. His short term memory is very compromised. Stopped Namenda and increased the Saraquil. I suspect more med changes to follow after I report to doctor his increased aggression.....I removed food trash today and he threw scissors and became angry towards me. He has not gotten physical but I do feel that it's coming.I have to remind him about our mom asking him if he wants to visit her. He still remembers us all just forgets what is not in front of him.   My brother was recently hospitalized with pneumonia in his right lung. Four days in hospital down at home for additional two weeks and still not 100%. Swallow study shows food and liquids may be slipping into lung. He's not too compliant on using a straw or eating any differently. Men! Having DS increases his swallowing issues due to the thickness of his tongue.    We have a solid ""team"" involved in his care but I am his main support. I love my brother so very very much that I struggle desperately to accept the reality of each piece of him that I lose.

At this point she is completely bedridden.  She cannot move herself at all and when dad and I have to change her she begs us not to move her cries and yells when we do and calls for her momma.  The ""collateral damage"" in the form of the anguish experienced by my 86 year old dad and myself whenever we have to move her is terrible.  The RN advised us to give her haloperidol to reduce her anxiety and morphine for pain.  Neither seems to have any effect when we have to move her.  She drinks very very little and hasn't eaten any solid food for over 10 days now.  Nor has she had a bowel movement.  She is utterly incontinent.    Her communication has been reduced to mumbling which we can rarely understand.  When we ask her questions about her comfort we have to keep them to yes or no answer level.  She sleeps nearly all the time.  She developed bedsores on her heels so we have had them elevated for several days now and they seem to be getting no worse.  I am praying for her release from this torment.  What I would like to know is...how long can she last like this?  I hope the hospice RN is right and she will just go to sleep and not wake up.  In the experience of those who have been there are we (please God) very near the end?  I know there are no absolute answers but does this sound familiar to anyone else?",False,redpondranch,2016-03-07,17.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147527757,,,AlzConnected,,,

Help!,My MIL (84 stage 6ish AD) is in hospital recovering from a partial hip replacement after a fall and fracturing her hip.  Physically (prior to this) she was in extremely good shape and the fall was somewhat unexpected (she was very steady on her feet).  She has never used a walker or cane at any time.   The hospital stay has been somewhat trying in that she (of course) does not understand or remember what happened and why she is there.  She ripped out IV's and tried to get out of bed (prior to surgery - she was in hospital 2 days before it was performed).  She had the surgery Monday night.  We have had a family member with her at all times and the last 2 nights the hospital provided a sitter.  She cannot articulate that she needs to go to the bathroom so she gets very agitated.  My fear is what happens when they discharge her?  She will not remember to use a walker not remember she is healing or any of the instructions about limited sitting etc etc.  We are in Canada and so the hospital social worker is supposed to connect with her Memory care facility to determine if they can provide the care.  Her sleep habits are all over the map so I can see her getting up during the night and falling after experiencing unexpected pain.  What typically happens in this case - does anyone know or what should we do.  I suppose we can hire someone 24x7 while she heals? Is that the best option?  She does live in the MC with her husband who is 88 and also has dementia - so he will be of no help (and may actually hinder...and the MC room is very small).  We have a small family and there aren't enough of us to cover this...please help.  Feeling very stressed,False,meand2girls,2015-01-07,64.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147528071,,,AlzConnected,,,

No good options.,My mother 87 who has been in assisted living for 3 years(MCI stage 6ish) recently suffered a full rectal prolapse. She has pain somebleeding discomfort and she simply doesn’t understand what’s happening. Nursesat assisted living have been dealing with the prolapse but it is reallyoutside the scope of their usual level of care and they urged me to take herto a surgeon. I called around regarding other options—Hospice? Additional nursingservices provided in but not by assisted living—but none of these were viable. Itook her to a surgeon (difficult—I realized that day that I can no longertransport her she’s too feeble and I can’t push her in walker with seat as ithurts my back; could not lift and store a wheelchair if we borrowed one) andhe felt that she was a poor candidate for surgery (elderly dementia floppyorgans bad delirium after abdominal surgery in 2013) and that more nursing carewould be a better choice.  I get that but because Mom is on Medicaid getting her intoa decent nursing care facility will be very hard from assisted living. Longwaiting lists only a few options. Her current case worker suggested that shemight not even qualify for admission unless she were officially rejected forsurgery (pre-surgical clearance in 2 weeks); even then she would not takepriority on a list. Everyone says the best way to get her into a nursing homeis to have her discharged from hospital directly. I get that too. So surgeryhas been scheduled (though not until 8/5!).   This situation seems to have no good options. She’s in painsuffering. The last thing I want is for her to have surgery—very hard on heron me (she’ll need 24 hour supervision in hospital at least until theyprescribe a sitter) delirium is hell and then rehab move to nursing home godknows where…all bad. If surgery is successful she might be continent (she wasbefore prolapse) but a downtown in cognition is very likely. Frankly theprolapse alone has caused a big deterioration in her speech mobility andlucidity.   I so wish she’d have a heart attack and be free. “Pleaseput me in my grave” she says to me.

But here I am…Mygrandmother was diagnosed in late-2001 after suffering a stroke and her lifehas drastically changed ever since. She has been in a variety of care settingsincluding under my family’s roof for nearly two years. I was 9 when she wasfirst diagnosed and it is unbelievable to see how the disease has affected herthrough 15 years’ time.     Here lately I have found myself nearly emotionally numb –unsure of what I am feeling why I am feeling it and how to rid it. A monthago today I walked away from an amazing career in another state to be back withfamily. While I miss the job deeply family is always number 1 in my book.  Perhaps it is a sense of uncertainty if I madethe right decision perhaps this is all timed around brain awareness month butperhaps it is just overthinking and over worrying. Regardless of what it is itis not a pleasant feeling. I want to run away to a happier place where she isnot suffering. I have had passing thoughts of suicide – thinking life isn’tfair and why it is worth living when there is so much negativity and pain. Ihave backed off from many commitments…because I am fearful of breaking down inpublic fearful I will lose friends because of various judgements and fearfulof not doing enough to support my grandmother and my family during thistransitionary time.     Selfishly I want her to look at me and tell me who I amwho she is and talk about joyous memories we shared together. Realistically Iam lucky if she says a few words to me during our time together. Selfishly Iwant her to live for another 91 years so she can experience life longer –perhaps gain those 15 lost years back and live the life she worked so hard tohave. Realistically when you love someone you learn to let them go. Life isvery hard when you cannot do for yourself – you rely on someone for youreveryday activities. How can I help someone I love dearly when I can’t seem togather my thoughts feelings or actions? She has no idea she has Alzheimer’sthankfully. I want to be the strongest support system and best granddaughter I canbe but there is a lot on my end that needs to be done.     To anyone out there who can offer a few thoughts I wouldreally appreciate it. I am excited to finally have the confidence (and words)to see where this sharing process leads.

Response from Zaldy S. Tan MD   Associate Professor Department of Medicine Division of Geriatrics University of California Los Angeles; Medical Director UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care Program Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Los Angeles California In providing medical care to older patients physicians and other healthcare professionals frequently come in contact with caregivers who accompany patients to clinic visits or keep them company during hospitalizations. This is especially true of patients with dementia who often rely on caregivers to take them to their appointments and to provide or corroborate their medical histories. Yet how often do busy healthcare professionals take the time to ask how the caregivers themselves are faring?  In 2015 friends and family of people with Alzheimer disease and other dementias provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care a contribution to the nation valued at $221.3 billion. [1]  Caregivers provide a valuable service to the healthcare system yet most of them receive inadequate training and support for this important role. As a result caregivers of persons with dementia are vulnerable to social isolation financial strain and poor quality of life. [2]  Dementia caregivers also are more likely to suffer from such health issues as depression anxiety and physical illnesses compared with non-caregivers. [3]   With their focus on the patient's well-being healthcare professionals may not recognize that caregiver stress and burnout can lead to detrimental outcomes not only for the caregiver but also for their patient. Persons with dementia whose caregiver suffers from burnout are more likely than non-caregivers to experience depression early institutionalization and increased risk of dying. [4]  Thus the quality of medical care provided by physicians and other healthcare professionals is inextricably linked to the health and well-being of the patient's caregiver.  Fortunately validated tools to detect caregiver stress including the modified Caregiver Strain Index [5]  and the Zarit Burden Interview [6]  are easy to administer in the clinic setting. These questionnaires may be administered to the caregiver in the waiting room and provide a composite score with a higher score corresponding to greater caregiver strain. When caregiver stress or strain is detected it is important to provide appropriate intervention.  The Alzheimer's Association lists the common signs of caregiver stress and provides practical recommendations for the stressed dementia caregiver .  At each encounter with a person afflicted with dementia it's appropriate for healthcare professionals to ask ""While the caregiver is taking care of the patient who is caring for the caregiver?"" Screening for caregiver stress and intervening before stress turns into burnout is part of good dementia care and will ensure that the patient with dementia will receive care that is competent and compassionate.

Maybe it will help her sleep better and maybe her severe anxiety will be reduced - maybe I need to look on the positive side.....

So my husband and I are expecting our first child in September which puts me about 6.5 months pregnant.  This should be a very exciting time for us but it isn't.  Its marred by my MIL's FTD and the baggage she bought into it.  A little back story. . .My  MIL mainly worked for herself as a small business owner. Also in a transaction that allowed her to delay paying taxes she sold inherited property than purchased a 32 unit rental property late in life.  It was a bad idea and everyone told her so but she was persistent.  She didn't want to pay taxes for a war.  If she could save on taxes she would even if it made no sense.  In hindsight she probably had the beginning of dementia then.    She soon became over whelmed  and acquired a large amount of debt.  In 2012 my MIL kids finely realized something was seriously wrong and took over her finances and managing the rental property.  It took months to figure out and a year to set straight.  Also she was diagnosed with dementia that year.   By August 2013 she couldn't live at home and came to live with us for about a year until we couldn't safely take care of her (wandering and hallucinations/delusions).  After several hospital stays and  facilities she has finely found a home at a MC facility.  Since my MIL wouldn't qualify for Medicaid (even if she declare bankruptcy or spent down her money) Two of her children ( my husband included) continue to manage her rental property sell parcels of land and rent out her house in order to pay for her care.  And this is where we are having trouble.  Managing the property is getting too stressful for my husband.  This property is in a lower income community.  A lot of tenants pay late pay partial or don't pay at all.  Some tenants rent garages.  Some have special allowances. Higher turn over. Up keep of the property.  My SIL rents the units and my husband does the finances.  He gets very frustrated with the tenants and my SIL way of doing things.  He very particular. I have often thought he has some form of autism which makes processing negative emotions and feelings difficult.  So when he is dealing with his mother's mess his thought process is ""I hate dealing with other people's messes I have to give up on my interests to manage the apts. so I can pay my mother's bills so she can stay in the MC facility where she is slowly dying in agony."" On days where he has to deal with his mother's ""shit"" he is very moody and angry.  I usually get the brunt of his anger - Not physical but he's short tempered and makes mean remarks.  I also feel he isn't involved in the pregnancy as he should because of stress.  Tonight on the way home from a birthing class we had a fight about him not wanting to be in the room during delivery because I would be very short with him.  (which I feel is true but want him to realize it's the stress and pain of labor and it will pass.  Just something he will need to cope with.  Again autism here will hinder this).  It was said after a day of prepping his mother's house for sale.  He was upset and tired.  But it made me feel so alone.  And I am.  I have told no one of our issues or my fears.  I don't want friends and family to hate him or think badly of him.  But something has to change.  I thought about telling his sister that he isn't coping well with managing the apts. his mother and the baby coming.  Ask her to give him a vacation from the apts.  But she has a life and a baby too. She too works like crazy to keep her mom and us from certain financial ruin.  We are stuck until my MIL dies which I wish for more every day.  Horrible truth.    Thanks for reading.",False,Purring_kitty_kat,2014-08-05,77.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147527111,,,AlzConnected,,,

I feel like I am responsiblefor keeping her comfortable because she can't figure out whichmedication to take.  When I ask which medicine or treatment shethinks will help she is very undecided and not sure.   I do not knowwhat to do  and furthermore I don't think anyone else will. Doctors have tried for sixty years to get rid of her headaches andthey have not been able to do it.  We have found a way to treat thesymptom and it works most of the time but not always.  Her back painis eased somewhat with ibuprofen and rest but there isn't a realsolution.  Her shoulder aches do to a surgery a few years back andthere is no stopping the discomfort other that some pain pills thatseem to help a little.  Recently she has been having complaints about upsetstomach.  I think much of that is anxiety do to the confusion causedby the alz.  I am trying some things to address that problem.   I feel helpless and in pain myself that she is suffering.  Hersuffering is very hard and almost impossible for me to disengagefrom.  Her being in pain also makes me feel like a trapped animal.  Ican't figure out what to do for her and I can't seem to do like othersI have seen who seem to be able to just ignore peoples suffering.  Idon't know how nurses and doctors do their jobs.  On the one hand Iknow they have to disengage but on the other hand it occursto me that they are cold and ""just doing a job"".  I don't want to be judgmental about it.   They are not the problem however.  I amthe problem.  I am the one anxious frustrated sometimes angrybecause I can't fix it.   Are any of you feeling this or can you share what you are doing to address this problem in your caregiving.  Thanks",False,mark47,2013-07-03,11.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147527482,,,AlzConnected,,,

It goes to show that no matter how knowledgeable you are you just need others in the same situation for support. So here goes....   My mother takes to wandering the house at night. She is not (yet) to the point where she tries to leave the house but she gets into things like a child. This morning I found an entire container of potato salad in her room (which I had to throw out because I didn't know how long it had been in there and I cannot afford to continue to do things like this now that I'm forced into early retirement) and a container of coffee creamer and a Keurig pod of coffee which she had peeled the top off of. Just when I walked in there she was about to pour the coffee into the creamer container. Yikes!   I just do not know what to do to stop her from doing these things. I have snacks laid out with her name on them but she doesn't seem to see them or she simply doesn't want them. She has an impulse problem much like a toddler has with seeing something then grabbing it and wanting it. Even if she can't figure out what to do with it.   It's very difficult because I do not have anyone to help me so there are no shared responsibilities here. I am an only child my husband works out of state so we have a commuter relationship and my children do not want to be involved. I wouldn't expect them to be either.   Have any of you ever had to get cabinet and refrigerator locks? I cannot hide my kitchen with a curtain because I have an open air kitchen without a door. The Safety Baby Magnet Locks are ideal for her but I'm afraid she'll simply yank the cabinet so hard it'll pull the locks off since they're applied only with adhesive.   Keeping her awake all day is difficult at best and even if I can she still wakes at night and wanders. I had to install a lock on the backdoor because she kept letting the dogs out at night and then leaving them outside. They're spoiled pups so they bark and cry wanting to come in and one of my neighbors does not appreciate it at all and it's very understandable.   It's just so hard to deal with! Are there any other suggestions? I think my answer is probably the locks but what a pain! I'm not a very patient person and I can see losing my magnet or something.

Visits are heartbreaking (at a NH). She is on hospice (for 3rd and final time) and there is some peace in knowing they are there every day and help to keep her as comfortable as possible but it is torture watching her deteriorate this way. She seems to mumble a lot almost like chanting when awake and she reaches out to us and doesnt want to let go Today she had these body spasms that were frankly very frightening to watch. The nurses had just given her pain meds so we waited for it to take effect and she finally fell asleep.  Yesterday the hospice nurse called me and told me Mom seemed to have a moment of clarity and said she was afraid to die. This killed me to hear and I only wonder how long this phase will last and how aware she is of what is happening to her. I would just like to ask for prayers for God to take her soon and peacefully. We watched our Father die of lung cancer and this is reminding me of that it is just so hard to see your parents go this way. It is heartbreaking!  I dont know how we get through this but somehow we will. I have read some of the posts on this last stage and how cruel it can be and that scares me. So if you could say a prayer for my Mom Claire and for us I would be very appreciative.

She is having serious hallucinations is confused all the timefades in and out loses everything and her judgment is just awful. But before she was diagnosed her doctor said her knees were so bad she would be in a wheelchair in three years if she did not have them replaced. She did not want them done because her friends had very bad experiences with the surgery ( long recovery can barely walk after surgery) . But today she told me she wants the surgery right away a neighbor told her she should do it and that the neighbor recovered  in 3  weeks that she is in too much pain and wants to meet with her doctor ASAP and get the ball rolling. The only positive thing I could think of about the surgery is that is would put her in the hospital and physical therapy while I try and piece together the puzzle of medicaid support and how to handle what is just overwhelming.

Its been a tough road for grandma and I would like some advice from those who might have the same experience.    History:    My 90 year grandma has experienced some difficult things in her past before I was born and throughout her life. I think she's always been depressed about it but she always held it in. She used to live with me for the last 26 years of my life and then we had to move her to a nursing facility in Alameda CA a couple of years ago because she was a fall hazard at home.   Everything seemed great for the 2 years there until she kept falling and we had to restrict her to her room. Fast forward to the present (4 years later) shes now bed bound and is crying almost every time she's awake (sounds and looks like shes in agony but no pain). She cries so much that her voice is raspy and she also has a tendency to rub her head to the point where hair comes off (she's had bald spot before just from this). I asked her why she is crying and she says she doesn't know talking to family members works but we can't be there forever. She only speaks Chinese and none of the staff there speaks her language she will usually cry within a few minutes of them leaving.   She was on hospice program for the last 5 months but was taking out of it this week because her weight has been stable (was not stable dropping before being admitted to hospice program).   Medications:   We tried various of antidepressents but nothing seemed to work. Right now she's taking ativan which is working since she's so tired she can't cry but its just a bandaid and it doesnt really solve anything. She's on zyprexia right now for the last couple of weeks but I dont think its working and i want to see. I've talked to 2 different doctors and they dont know what else to try. I tried to withhold antipsychotics as much as possible but i felt like the benefits outweigh the costs.    Complications:   My grandma only speaks chinese (cantonese) and does not understand or speak english. None of the staff know what she's saying. Staff can't be there 24/7 to be with her. Another problem is that I can't be there all the tiem even talking to the phone helps sometimes but only works for a few minutes before she forgets can cries again. Her left arm seized up and doesnt work her legs dont really work.    Tried:   I've tried many things but nothing seems to help: Aroma therapy having her outside more leaving the tv or radio on having someone massage her phone calls to help calm her down when crying stuffed animals for her to squeeze. It's almost impossible for her to be relocated closer to me because of her crying and SF is overfilled.   I am the primary decision maker for her and I try to visit whenever I can (about 2-3 times a week) and she is calm almost 100% of the time im with her but I cant be there all the time and since she's in another city (im in San Francisco about an hour away) and I have a full time job its even more difficult for me to see her often especially when she has a bad day but im just a temporary solution. It pains me so much to hear her cry and know she is suffering almost everyday. I'm burnt out and I've felt so helpless on whats going on. If you have any advice for me other than medication please feel free to share.   Much appreciated   Eric,False,eng95,2016-05-25,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147526829,,,AlzConnected,,,

None of our local doctors or pain clinics will continue his pain meds ... forcing me to take him back to his hometown at least once every 3 months to get the new scripts.   How in the world do I get him to come back ""home"" after I take him down?",False,JazzyLM,2016-05-07,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147526454,,,AlzConnected,,,

Since then my Mom is grief stricken and I fear she is declining.  I worry she will die of a broken heart.  They were buddies for the past 10 years or so. The past 2 years they were separated but talked on the phone everyday.  I had to bring my Mom to live with me after she was diagnosed with ALZ.  He was 6 years older than her and needed his family to take care of him.  I noticed in the past few months that the daily calls were lessening so I feared he was ill.  We travel back and forth about every 5-6 months between our house in Texas and her house in Florida so that we can take care of her house and to give them time to visit with each other. Every visit lasted 6-7 weeks but it just wasn't enough time for them.  When we got here this time he was sick then he fell and was hospitalized right after we arrived.  I took her to see him in the hospital but he was not responsive so she wasn't satisfied with the visit as you would expect.  They didn't get to talk to each other and she really needed that. She didn't get to see him again until after he passed. It took a couple of days for her to remember that he passed she was confused.  What I want to know if anyone cares to offer feedback.  Is it possible for her to take a turn for the worse in her ALZ process spurred by grief?  I think this would be possible since I know that physical conditions such as UTI sets them back it only makes sense to me that emotional pain could do the same.  Mom normally gets up by 9ish every morning but she has been excessively sleeping. Today she slept until 3PM.  The last two nights she has had an issue with making it to the bathroom in time.  She is not dressing properly she may have on PJ top and jeans Sunday she never got dressed.  One night she slept with her shoes and glasses on. Normally I help her pick out her clothes but I haven't pushed for her to dress. I probably wouldn't want to get dressed either. I am trying to allow her time to grieve and make sure she is fed clean and have her meds each day.  We will be headed home in a few days and if things don't change after getting home I plan to take her in to the doctor. The doctor might want to adjust her antidepressant.   In addition we are in her house but she is getting confused where her room or bathroom is.

If I put another carpet or rug down the urine could soak through into the floor anyway plus it will get that funky smell again.  I am stuck here and wonder what practical solutions there may be especially in light of the fact that we are trying to get mom to move in with us.",False,kelantol,2013-05-03,422.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147526708,,,AlzConnected,,,

In September he had knee surgery and the pain medication after really affected his mind - his personality changed he hallucinated etc. It was pretty bad for about two months and when he got home he got much better. He's been in and out of the hospital/physical rehab since then and he has good days when he's pretty clear and bad days where his memory is pretty bad.  He goes to a neuro who says he has dementia but not bad. There's been no mention of Alzheimer's - just a broad dementia diagnosis.   Here's the thing: my dad's wife (my stepmom they've been married about 5 years) went out of town the past week to take care of her son who had surgery. My brother and I have taken turns caring for my dad but haven't been there all day every day as dad gets really unhappy when he thinks he's being babysat. This is where I'm struggling. Because there is no diagnosis he believes he is totally fine to be on his own. I don't think I agree. He was good on Saturday clear. Then yesterday he couldn't remember which of his wives was my mom. I'm 36; he was married to my mom for 35 years until she passed. These are the things that worry me.  What do I do? This is my dad and I love him and don't want to go against him but I also feel like we're at a crossroads here and I need to do what is best for him  to keep him safe even if he disagrees (I'm the power of healthcare if he can't make decisions). He still has a drivers' license (though he doesn't feel comfortable driving thankfully).   How do I get a clear diagnosis whether it's alzheimers or not? If he does need supervision now where do I even begin looking for help during the day that won't cost a billion dollars so that his wife can do what she needs to do like errands etc.?   I'm torn in this middle ground of having no idea where to go from here not wanting to make my dad sad or mad but wanting to make sure that he is always safe and taken care of.

My mother has had generalised anxiety for about six years.  Mirtazapine (Remeron) at 15 mg served her well for 18 months but 3 months ago she had a spike in anxiety and sleeplessness mostly due to breaking out in sweats during the night.  Her Mirtazapine was then increased to 22.5 mg (two months ago) then 30 mg (two weeks ago).  Her anxiety is worse now - previously her day time anxiety was fairly under control but now that is worse as well.  She has cold sweats and shivers (bit like the flu she says) pain in her upper back severe agitation mouth sore (never had a cold sore in her life until two weeks ago) and a few other things - all these I have seen can be side-effects of Mirtazapine.  The psycho-geriatrician says we must stick out the full month to see what happens.  But the plan after that is to increase it yet again...  it seems cruel to put someone through this if these are indeed side effects.    Anyone have any experience of this medicine or have any alternative medicines that have worked for anxiety/sleep?

The cardiologist started her on a blood thinner so that the sluggish blood flow at least doesn't result in clots.   The cardiologist is also suggesting a procedure (ablation) to stop the electrical misfires.   It would be a one day procedure with a couple weeks or less of recovery.    The problem:  Mom isn't able to follow the diagnosis or recommended treatment.  She can barely retain information as to why she's even at the hospital.  She remembers having chest pain but can't seem to grasp much beyond that.  She asks over and over what happened and why she's still in the hospital.   She says she should have just gone home and laid on the couch ""until the chest pain passed"" so she wouldn't have to be at the hospital.   All she talks about is wanting to get out of there.    Her reasoning skills and ability to thoughtfully weigh the pros/cons of having the ablation are compromised.   Chances are that if left up to her she'll pass on it so she can go home faster.   Since she lives alone that decision will most likely lead to her death when the next episode of a-fib happens as it's unlikely she'll call anyone for help (stubborn).     To complicate matters she hasn't assigned dPOA to anyone.    We (her children) feel she has good quality of life and will have several more years if she has the ablation.         Help?!",False,JustLikeMom,2012-02-07,494.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147526100,,,AlzConnected,,,

When I've done so gently she has begged me not to ""turn against her too"" because the rest of the household does not have much patience with her. In addition she has begun verbally mistreating my grandfather. She treats him as the reason every bad thing happens. And almost every good thing he tries to do for her she twists into something that was meant to hurt her. I can see it wearing on him and he has been spending more time away from her outside as a result which makes her suspicions grow.  I'm at a loss as to what to do or how best to comfort her or fix this situation if it can be fixed. It has been a long time that this has been going on and my hopes of the situation slowly getting better naturally with time are waning.

She does tend to complain of low back pain and has for months but this is definitely abdominal.  Well she was not actually complaining but she will grimace and press her hands on her lower abdomen and sometimes cuss a bit. I believe she had a UTI the week before last and had just finished up antibiotics last week. Her behavior had improved last week with an increase in her cannabis dosages but I could see by her expression and body movements that she seemed to be having this pain. I mentioned it to her caregivers and they had her urine tested and it was negative. I suggested we have her doctor check her out I think last Thursday. On Friday her behavior started to deteriorate which at that time I attributed to a drop in her cannabis. Talked to the caretakers got her dose back to what it was and again asked them to get her doctor to examine her. His practice is just down the street and he sees patients at the residence so he is there quite often. I was away on the weekend and had my brother go in Saturday and Sunday and he said her behavior was not good. I went in Monday as she was finishing lunch and she was a mess. Angry being mean to the caregivers just overall not in a good mood.  Had been refusing her medicine all day. At that point they had crushed medication up in yogurt and were trying to feed it to her. I think she got most of it down but not all.  I could see by her face that she was uncomfortable. Called her doctor's office throughout the day and finally he examined her last night. Of course she was relaxing in bed when he came and didn't seem to have any symptoms. He couldn't find anything. Abdomen soft no pain that he could find. He said we could order an ultrasound or a CT scan but he didn't seem to think we would find anything. He also didn't think we would be able to get her to tolerate either. He came up with the possibility of it being bladder spasms and said he could try medication for that and see if it helps. The last thing we need is more meds but we can't just go on like this.  I had never heard of bladder spasms but after some reading it does seem to describe her pain and reaction to it as far as I can tell and she has had recent UTI's so maybe that's what it is.  We are going to go schedule an ultrasound also to rule out anything else. Has anyone had bladder issues but negative for UTI? From what I have read it doesn't appear to be a simple fix.,False,Dawn831,2015-10-30,262.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147525711,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am now scared to return to the facility to face the anger!  I also feel guilty when attending my children's activities and I look at other grandparents that are older and in good health and wander ""why my mother?""

749,621065047b65de9a5b668eaa,2147525373,2016-03-09 20:43:00,Feeling Sad and Guilty,Sometimes you feel so alone in dealing with this disease. I have one sister but she lives in another state and both she and her daughter are disabled so it is difficult for her to get here very much to visit Mom. I do understand the difficulties my sister faces but it still is hard not having her here more often. Prior to Mom being diagnosed with dementia/alz. my sister used to take Mom down to her place for a week or so at a time. It was nice because it gave me a little bit of a break. However since her diagnosis she doesn't have her down anymore. I haven't asked her why but it is more difficult to have her come and stay now. I know she doesn't always know what to talk to her about. Mom doesn't initiate much conversation now.   When Mom first went into AL I visited at least every other day and sometimes more. The last few months I haven't been going quite as often. I still try to go every two days but sometimes I might go three days between visits. However I always end up feeling guilty. Today was one of those days. I was going to go late this afternoon but I kept thinking of things I should get done so I didn't go. Problem is I feel guilty about not going then I get to feeling down and I don't accomplish the things I thought should get done anyway. I'm single and have no children so it's not like I have other family who need my attention. I deal with a lot of pain as a result of some health conditions so that makes it hard for me to get stuff done because my mobility is not very good. I originally planned to take Mom to a movie today but it has gotten more difficult for me to take her places partially due to her illness and partially due to my mobility issues. So that just layers on some more guilt.   I love her so much and I have tried to be there for her as much as possible. It is so difficult to see all the changes that have taken place in the past couple of years. For a couple of months now she doesn't want to sit in her apartment unless someone is with her. I haven't been able to figure out why. She often goes down the hall and sits in a straight back chair and sleeps with her head dropped forward. I guess a couple of positives are that she is out around some of the other people a little more and she is involved in activities a little more. However it is very difficult to reach her by phone. Sometimes I call the facility and ask them to have her call me. I have wondered if it has anything to do with my not going quite as often. She doesn't get a lot of visitors and so I wonder if she just feels lonely sitting in her apartment.   I'm sorry this is so long but I appreciate being able to share my thoughts.

Early in my life I became addicted to drugs and ended up in state prison for nearly 20 years. When I finally came up for parole I called home to share the news with my Mom and Dad. Dad usually answers the phone and this time wasn't any different. After a couple of minutes I asked to speak to Mom but was told by my Dad that Mom couldn't come to the phone. When I asked why my Dad told me for the first time my Mom had Alzheimer's. I was devastated. My goal when I came out of prison was to do something to finally make my Mom proud after all the years of heartache and pain I had caused  her. My Mom and I had been very close. When I finally made it out I went down to see my Mom and I wasn't prepared for the pain I felt when she no longer knew who I was. My Mom passed away on November 16 2008. Thankfully my Dad had refused to put my Mom into any type of home and stated that he would provide all the care she would need. My dad was 75 at the time and he did an unbelievable job. Four years after my Mom passed away my Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's also. Thankfully we(my three sister's and I) were able to find caregiver's to come in to help as us kids as we lived 101/2 hours away. With both my Mom and Dad developing late onset Alzheimer's I am scared that I will also. I don't have the financial ability to pay for any type of care and the relationships with my sister's have become strained beyond repair. My fear is if I do developed this horrible disease the only option available to me will be to be out in the local County home where care is minimal at best. I pray that I don't develop this disease but I want to be as prepared as possible in case I do. Does anyone know of any type of research that has been done to find out if in fact Alzheimer's is hereditary?

After two weeks on medications for that she became more aggressive slapping people and exhibiting uncontrollable repetitive behaviors. The night nurse sent out to a senior behavioral unit first time for a few hours and the second time she was there for 12 days.  In hindsight I wish I had gotten her out of there sooner it seemed to break her spirit.  She returned depleted congested and miserable.  Hospice came in to help a little over a week ago just a few days after she returned.  She is now at peace relieved of the confusion agitation and her loss of independence which was so important to her.   I want to thank everyone here for all your help when I came here to read lost and confused in pain and sometimes just looking for people who understood the chaos and confusion in our world.  This is such a wonderful resource for people dealing with this horrible disease.  Before Mom's diagnosis in 2014 I hadn't any idea what AD was...and since then have felt so sad my brother and I weren't aware the changes occurring in Mom were not a result of her 'turning into a cranky old lady'. We both would have responded differently if we knew her anger and pushing us away was the result of a disease and not my Mom's fierce need to be independent.

Two days later we go back and they give her tramadol and take an Xray. ( I won't go into how the care wasn't very good)/\. Went to her doctor who orders a kidney sonogram as well as one for the bladder. Last night I couldn't get her to eat so she couldn't take pain meds. Finally got her to eat some toast because she seemed to really need the meds. Slept for the first time in a week. We have an appointment at the back doctor next week. She has previous back issues as well as type one diabetes. Any ideas on how to get her to eat/drink? She is 80. Any information on pain in Alzheimers patients?

A little over two months ago she moved in with my husband my 1 1/2 year old and myself. Prior to this she resided with my cousin and his family (wife son mother aunt) who lives 833 miles away. She was supposed to stay with him until I finished graduate school but ended up staying with him for three years. Mom always begged me to take her home and when I would try my cousin argued that I had my career to consider and then after I had my son my baby to take care of.   In all honesty I could not percieve why anyone in their right mind would volunteer to take on such a task caring for someone with Alzhiemer's so I believe that the money we were giving him gave him incentive which I was fine with. Everyone needs an incentive. But he always insists that he cares for my mom and loves her like a mother. I don't belive him and I don't know why. Maybe I'm just too suspicious of the entire thing. Maybe I just don't believe that anyone will love and care for my mom as well as I can.  My cousin's wife is a nurse and she is considering opening up room in their home to other patients with the same needs as my mother's but whenever I visited I couldn't help but notice that they did not spend much time with my mom so how they would manage more elderly residents who's to say? The family would harbor in their rooms between meals. Twice a week they would go to church and every morning they took a brisk walk. But that's the extent as far as I could see of their interaction with my mom. This made me uncomfortable because I feel that my mom needs more activities and interaction.   On our last visit I noticed mom's wardrobe was lacking there was toothpaste all over her face one morning and no one was assisting her with her baths so I told my cousin I was taking my mom home for the holidays and I haven't returned her since. Needless to say family is urging that I return her.   I'm burning my wick at both ends trying to find the needed resources to keep her here with us (in home care day care support groups Alzheimer's programs) but it just isn't happening fast enough. Watching my mother suffer is hard. I don't sleep at night. I have a continual pain in my throat like I'm on the verge of crying.   On the other hand my son loves my mom. Mom plays with him and watching the two of them together brings me such joy. My son asks for her all the time. This is what's kept me from a nervous breakdown so far.  Mom also speaks mostly in her native language and unfortunately I never learned this language. The benefits of staying with my cousin is he does speak the language. He also knows how to cook her favorite foods (I can't cook if my life depended on it. It's frozen pizza waffles eggs and salad for us). So what I'm asking is:  Did I make a mistake bringing my mom here? I'm suffering because I have to watch her decline and I can't pull myself together. Is this something I can really handle? Are there other mother's of young children out there in the same boat? How are they coping? Should I just return my mom to my cousin and tell myself I did the best I can? I can't help but resent my mom for me having to make these decisions without her input. I tried to get her to help with the decisions early in the disease but she was so stubborn and refused to accept that she had Alzheimer's. So here I am making these decisions and I don't know if I'm making the right ones. I want to chersih the time I have left with my mom not throw her away like a broken toy.

They are treating the UTI and yesterday she was in better spirits than she had been before. There were a few calls a couple of nights that she had been pacing and very angry. (The reason they called was because they noticed that when she heard either mine or my sister's voice- she would be more willing to follow the Nurses' instructions and settle down for the night). Last night she was better but the Sundowning effect was setting on and there was a bit more confusion. She did have some fairly lucid periods during the day she called from the Hospital wondering when we were coming there to get her. She is on Haldol. 0.5 - I am not sure how often she gets it but they took her off the Seroquel which did not appear to be working so well. I can tell that the medicine makes her more cloudy because she has difficulty remembering her phone number and address which she could quite easily recall last week. As I said I have mixed feelings if these medicines take the edge off and help her to be less anxious and confused- do they do so at the expense of the Dementia?- are there other suitable drugs? or are these effects temporary and wear off after the medicine is completely in her system. Chances are she may be there for at least another week then possibly a stint in Rehab because her hip pain symptoms have not subsided. All I know is that Mom wants to come home- she now has much more of an awareness of where she is and she's not very happy.

I'm sad I'm angry I'm lost.,I've been reading these message boards on and off for the last few weeks.  Its been extremely helpful to me to know I'm not alone.  However I feel alone!!  My dad is 83 and is living in a nursing home since November.  He hasn't been officially diagnosed with anything besides mild cognitive impairment back in the summer. Over the years he has had 3 strokes couple of heart attacks blocked carotid arteries and over all poor health.     I was a stay at home mom of 1 child I was in school part time and I had my own house cleaning business. I ended up leaving school for a few reasons one of them being my parents needed more help.   About 2 years ago I became more involved with my dads care. He was in a car accident which he caused because he blacked out.  I convinced him to not drive anymore.  I started going to his doctor appointments with him.  Looking back I now realize his primary care physician was not the greatest.  I wish I stuck with my gut and got him a new doctor but my mom convinced me otherwise.    We went to many appointments and he was treated for various  physical ailments (he has a dropped foot severe back pain shoulder pain etc) over many many months.    He was living at home with my 82 year old mom who is in pretty good physical and emotional health.  I initially got them into a new apartment because they needed one level living.  I did so much research and endless paperwork to get him and her the care they need.  I was able to get him home health aids with minimal co-pays.  Then he started to need more care.  Physical therapy occupational therapy.  It became harder and harder for him to walk.  The messages from his brain were not getting to his legs in order for them to move.  He had good strength in his legs just not the ability to move them like he wanted.  It got worse pretty quick.  He was falling ALL THE TIME.  We tried to convince him he couldn't walk unassisted but he just kept forgetting and would get up with out even using his walker.  I was called so many times by my mom to come help get him up off the  floor.  We had to call EMT's several times to assist.  One night at 2am I got a frantic call that dad made it to the bathroom thought he had used the toilet but missed and was now lying in his own feces.    All the while we noticed his cognitive behavior getting worse by the day.  He was never a happy go lucky kind of guy.  He was always a bit depressed and angry.  He and mom never had a loving marriage but always stayed together.  They don't like each other very much but also love each other very much you know what I mean???  All this was gettting way too much for mom (and me) to handle on our own.  He was going 3 days a week to adult day care but I had to be there 2 times a day to help him in and out of the house and into and out of the transport van. We made the decision to place him in a nursing home.  We were lucky enough to get him into one fairly quick.  Which was good and bad.     Did I mention I have 5 siblings???  No?  Well that's because it doesn't feel like it. One of my jobs was to keep everyone in the loop another time consuming bitch of a job.  But hey I didn't have a REAL job anyway.......That's another part of the story I have yet come to terms with and a huge part of my anger.    Dad is now safe in a nursing home but it hasn't been any easier on me.  I am so sad for him.  I am so sad for me.  I am feeling so guilty.  Maybe I could rent a bigger apartment and I could take care of him full time maybe I could find a nicer nursing home maybe maybe maybe.......  I try to visit him almost every day.  I can't not.  He is in and out of his dementia state.  Sometimes he seems just fine except for his physical disability.  Sometimes he calls me (I got him one of those one touch dial phones) and asks when I 'm picking him up to go home.  Sometimes he calls and says he can't find mom or he doesn't know where he is.  I can usually talk him down and calm him down.  But its so damn sad.   I don't know how to handle the grief.  My siblings don't understand.  They are all in their own little world of denial.  My mom is trying to understand but has her own crap to deal with.  My husband is as supportive as he can be.  My 12 year old son is just pissed that I spend so much time with my dad or working on something for my dad.  I've been trained by PT at the nursing home to assist him with toileting so at least I feel like I can help when I'm there.  However the last few times he has had a bowel movement (in his depends)while I'm with him and I end up cleaning him and changing him myself....its sometimes easier than trying to get aids in to help him.  If you've read this far thank you. It feels good just to write it all (well most) down.  So tell me dear ones how do you handle the grief???    #lostalonesadandangry,False,lizfiner,2016-01-01,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147524515,,,AlzConnected,,,

Plus we pay.. 5 min  10 minutes adds up each day.  Two alternatives have them call my house when there and when leaving but that can be a pain. I remember an agency had people call their agency from the house phone and that was odd times were off in the agencys favor... So what you would do.. I have no way to know when this girls leave except mom calls... Though the other night I went there early girl was gone mom fast asleep.. didn't pass the girl in the driveway as to the time she said..... So odd and now my trust of her is gone..  What you would do suggestions please...Who can you trust anymore!!,False,birdy,2011-12-15,181.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147524707,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's actually from Valentine's Day 2014.  They make a big deal of Valentine's Day at her SNF.  They actually choose 5 candidates for Valentine Queen &amp; 5 for Valentine King.  Deb was one in the running in 2014.  This picture was taken of her on Valentine's Day 2014 when she was crowned Valentine Queen!  The staff &amp; residents all vote for the week leading up to Valentine's Day and Deb won hands down!  She was so very proud of it.  Back then she was walking and after the party she walked the halls of the nursing home &amp; waved in all the rooms to the people who were bedbound and didn't make the celebration.  She brought smiles to many faces that day.  So - being we're 2 weeks from Valentine's Day thought I'd use that picture.  Today was not one of her better days.  Just got home &amp; her Dementia was running away.  Also none of the regular staff was on her floor and her feeding tube is either irritated or getting infected.  God help us if she's getting another tube infection.  It was quite evident to my husband and me that she was in pain so I stayed on that nurse until she gave her something for pain and treated the site with triple antibiotic ointment.  I texted her charge nurse who will be on duty at 7am Monday about what was going on.  I know then that it'll be addressed very quickly.  I decorated her room for Valentine's Day today while my husband sat next to her playing music on my IPad.  By the time we left her she looked very tired but she looked more comfortable.  Just praying she gets better overnight now and not worse.  We're doing everything we can to keep her out of the hospital.  Just praying for her comfort and peace.

764,621067b77b65de9a5b669b5c,2147524859,2016-02-14 15:15:00,Update on Overwhelmed,My Mom's dementia is going from Moderate to more advanced and we've had several problems. Mainly associated with Caregiving. She receives 31 hours of Community Attendant services but we're now on Caregiver number 4 to begin tomorrow and I already do not have high expectations. I told the Agency that we needed someone with experience and yet again they are sending someone who does not have it. The longest they stay is about a week Mom usually accusing them of stealing by the 3rd or 4th day. Since she can not be left alone I am now on Week 4- of FMLA. I have run out of resources since I've used up my vacation time.   We've looked into a great Adult Daycare program which does have programs for Alz patients but they have a 6 month waiting list. I cannot afford to go private pay. I have 2 sisters who do provide some limited assistance but the word is limited. The Agency told me that I can be the provider myself but there is a do-not-hire clause in my case because I live with her. Although they said that if I can get a family member to sign up I can at least get that money from them. Mom is on a very limited income so it's just been real tough all round.   I last went to work the week of Jan. 19th I was in the Hallway and on the phone every 30 minutes to check on things at home. I could not concentrate and my  job is difficult and production oriented. The mental emotional and physical strain has definitely affected me.   The one saving grace I have is that Mom is still well enough to go to a Senior Center for about 5 hours a day she goes almost every day. I'm wondering if I could find something p/t during those hours.. that would mean that I would be here when the Caretakers are here and hopefully with some oversight things may stabilize somewhat. In the last month to add to our troubles Mom hurt her hip she's under the Dr's care for that as well. The pain meds plus the Seroquel and High Blood Pressure Meds seem to produce either moments of great clarity where she is almost back to her old self.......or moments of great agitation. She has an appointment with a Geriatric Psych/Neuro next month. Hopefully we can make some headway after that.   I am just at a difficult place I don't want to go back to work without a proper solution in place for Mom. She is not at the Nursing Home stage yet and putting her there will not help her as things stand right now. I am 60 a single man jobs are hard to find. FMLA will not last forever. Financially working p/t is not going to do a whole lot for me.....but it would be better than nothing. I will still need the Community Attendant services. Should I just continue to try and find a suitable companion thru the Agency....and not return to work until this matter is settled?. One of my Sisters has health problems herself her husband is protective of her and does not want her to be overtired caring for Mom furthermore she's 3. hours away. The other one literally lives down the street but perhaps emotionally she  can't taking seeing my Mom's demise. She does help......but you literally have to beg and plead and then it's only very limited.

765,621067cb7b65de9a5b669bbf,2147524516,2016-01-27 13:05:00,I'm new here. I'm sad I'm angry I'm lost.(1),I've been reading these message boards on and off for the last few weeks.  Its been extremely helpful to me to know I'm not alone.  However I feel alone!!  My dad is 83 and is living in a nursing home since November.  He hasn't been officially diagnosed with anything besides mild cognitive impairment back in the summer. Over the years he has had 3 strokes couple of heart attacks blocked carotid arteries and over all poor health.     I was a stay at home mom of 1 child I was in school part time and I had my own house cleaning business. I ended up leaving school for a few reasons one of them being my parents needed more help.   About 2 years ago I became more involved with my dads care. He was in a car accident which he caused because he blacked out.  I convinced him to not drive anymore.  I started going to his doctor appointments with him.  Looking back I now realize his primary care physician was not the greatest.  I wish I stuck with my gut and got him a new doctor but my mom convinced me otherwise.    We went to many appointments and he was treated for various  physical ailments (he has a dropped foot severe back pain shoulder pain etc) over many many months.    He was living at home with my 82 year old mom who is in pretty good physical and emotional health.  I initially got them into a new apartment because they needed one level living.  I did so much research and endless paperwork to get him and her the care they need.  I was able to get him home health aids with minimal co-pays.  Then he started to need more care.  Physical therapy occupational therapy.  It became harder and harder for him to walk.  The messages from his brain were not getting to his legs in order for them to move.  He had good strength in his legs just not the ability to move them like he wanted.  It got worse pretty quick.  He was falling ALL THE TIME.  We tried to convince him he couldn't walk unassisted but he just kept forgetting and would get up with out even using his walker.  I was called so many times by my mom to come help get him up off the  floor.  We had to call EMT's several times to assist.  One night at 2am I got a frantic call that dad made it to the bathroom thought he had used the toilet but missed and was now lying in his own feces.    All the while we noticed his cognitive behavior getting worse by the day.  He was never a happy go lucky kind of guy.  He was always a bit depressed and angry.  He and mom never had a loving marriage but always stayed together.  They don't like each other very much but also love each other very much you know what I mean???  All this was gettting way too much for mom (and me) to handle on our own.  He was going 3 days a week to adult day care but I had to be there 2 times a day to help him in and out of the house and into and out of the transport van. We made the decision to place him in a nursing home.  We were lucky enough to get him into one fairly quick.  Which was good and bad.     Did I mention I have 5 siblings???  No?  Well that's because it doesn't feel like it. One of my jobs was to keep everyone in the loop another time consuming bitch of a job.  But hey I didn't have a REAL job anyway.......That's another part of the story I have yet come to terms with and a huge part of my anger.    Dad is now safe in a nursing home but it hasn't been any easier on me.  I am so sad for him.  I am so sad for me.  I am feeling so guilty.  Maybe I could rent a bigger apartment and I could take care of him full time maybe I could find a nicer nursing home maybe maybe maybe.......

It's been a little while.   First our hospice volunteer came today so I could get some groceries.  My dads sister and hubby are coming from Inidana for a visit tomorrow.  Dad will celebrate his 85th birthday Saturday.  So... He's on thickener now so poptarts are getting harder for him to eat.   I found a box of chocolate filled Twinkies.  As you can see he's one happy man!!!!!      I LOVE his smile!!!!!  I've had a bad sinus and ear infection and it's really been a struggle to get to urgent care and get script and it wasn't getting better.   Finally after a week of pain and swelling and hurting Monday was the first time I didn't have a pounding headache.  Whew!!!  Sadly dad is getting much weaker.  He has fallen twice- Sunday and last night.  Both times trying to get out of his chair. He didn't get hurt but his heart is just doing everything it can.  His legs are weak and even with oxygen he's tired about 1/2 way through eating ( although he was fine with the Twinkie  .  His hospice nurse and I will be talking more in depth tomorrow about bringing in s bed to set up in the living room.  Sigh.   He's happy content still laughing.  All thet really matters!  I'm sending lots of hugs and of course the chocolate filled Twinkies to all!!!

Started Monday night.  Deb's feeding tube fell out AGAIN.  Day nurse calls me Tuesday morning to tell me night nurse had found it out &amp; replaced it - but didn't have her size &amp; had to go down a size making it leak any time she got up or moved much.  This causes more acid &amp; irritation to her skin.  They'd called her gastro doc ordered the size she needed &amp; would get it in her as soon as it came.  I get there to see her Tuesday &amp; about the only good thing about dementia Deb didn't remember it fell out &amp; she had a new one inserted.   Wednesday - I get a call @ 1PM at work right when I was going to eat lunch.  The new tube came the nurse tried to put it in (not her charge nurse who is usually on duty) &amp; couldn't get it in had another nurse try &amp; she couldn't either.  She told me ""You don't need to worry or come down.  We're going to transport her to her gastro doc as soon as the transport aide comes back.""  I told her under no uncertain terms would they transport her without me with her.  I was leaving work immediately.  I'm 45 minutes from the nursing home.  Zipped down the highway &amp; it's now @ 2PM.  I find out that her site had been without a tube since @ 12:15 - 12:30 &amp; they STILL hadn't even called the gastro doc to know if he was in the office!  I got hot.  You CANNOT leave a feeding tube site empty that long - it starts closing up within 2 hours.  I went into the Director of Nursing's Office &amp; demanded they call the gastro doc.  Nurse ran back to her desk &amp; called.  First words of the gastro doc's nurse were ""How long has it been without a tube?"" ... and then ""YOU GET A FOLEY TUBE IN THERE RIGHT NOW &amp; GET HER HERE ASAP!""  The nurse put a foley tube in &amp; Deb was hurting bad by now.  They get her transported for me &amp; I followed since I can't lift her or her wheelchair.  Now the gastro doc can't get the dang tube in.  He said the site started closing &amp; he didn't have a smaller tube in his office.  He put the foley tube back in &amp; said to take her back have them put the smaller tube in &amp; if they didn't want to do it to bring her back on Thursday &amp; he'd put it in on his lunch hour because he was doing scopes all day.  Deb hadn't been fed since 9AM &amp; it's now after 5PM.  Administrator comes in to check on her.   I think he got word things were messed up.  I told him exactly what happened &amp; the repercussions of their actions.  He just kept apologizing to me.  That didn't help Deb much.  I made sure she got fed got pain meds &amp; was resting comfortably before I left.  Got home @ 8PM &amp; hadn't eaten myself since breakfast.  Thursday she goes BACK to the gastro doc &amp; our brother actually said he'd go with her.  That was amazing in itself.  The gastro doc got the smaller tube in &amp; they got her back.  She fell right to sleep as soon as they fed her.  As soon as I got to her Friday she was bright eyed &amp; had to show me the new tube.  She was more alert than I've seen her in quite a while.  Saturday she was even more alert until @ 6PM.  It was unbelievable.  When we told her our brother was going to see her today she said ""He looks like Kojak!""  My hubby &amp; I laughed so hard.  Our brother has little hair &amp; shaves his head.  How she ever remembered Kojak was beyond me.  On Wednesday in the doctor's office she made the comment to me that she didn't have her dentures in &amp; covered her mouth.  She hasn't worn her dentures in 3 years or even asked for them!  She told me 3 years ago she didn't need them anymore and to take them home with me.  I was completely at awe by the statements she made this week.  They'd come out right in the middle of the dementia.  So I learned how strong &amp; especially assertive I've become since being Deb's advocate.  I never used to be anywhere near this assertive but I just don't tolerate sub-par care or treatment for her.  Some here have asked why I post on feeding tubes so much.  Well I hope sharing our experiences will make anyone really think before they have one placed in their loved one.  There are SO many things that can go wrong with them.

769,6210687e7b65de9a5b669ee8,2147523989,2016-01-05 19:02:00,Caring For My Mom,All the years I have known my mom when I was little my mom never asked for anything for herself at birthdays or christmases except to be able to stay in her house. My mom is from the WWII generation from the depression era and they were the first and only owners of their house. The bought it worked hard and paid it off. The house represents security to my mom as long as she is here she will be ok is how she sees it.  So when my dad passed away and then my aunt my mom’s one true close friend her sister and it was clear that my mom would need help if she hoped to stay in her home I had a very tough choice to make. My siblings all sided with the idea that they had lives and couldn’t be bothered and that my mom should sell the house and go into a nursing home. My children and I lived in California 2000 miles away. I loved my mom and I was deeply grateful for all she had done for me through the years. Having been a sickly kid my mom always attended me and never once made me feel bad about being sick or all the medical bills. When I had kids she was a very involved and supportive grandmother to them. So now she needed help how else could I respond but to be there for her as she had been there for me. So we packed our things I left my rather posh job and we returned home to care for her until the end. That was ten years ago.  During that time a few years into caring for her I became ill. I spent years struggling to walk. I used a walker but in truth I needed a wheelchair…but that would mean I couldn’t live here and I couldn’t accept that. My medical providers got to know me and my spirit then. To say it was hard caring for my mom in those years would be a gross understatement as I started each day unable to walk and had to roll out of bed and crawl to the toilet. Pulling myself up onto the toilet felt very much like climbing Mt. Everest every morning. I would then be able to use the walls to pull myself up into standing. I was in high levels of pain every day. And the multiple times I needed to climb the stairs to take care of my mom felt like they would be the death of me. I was so weak that I would need to rest two or three times during the climb to make it to the top. But I did it. To me that was the most salient point that despite everything that was happening to me – I found a way to do it.  It was sure hard but I didn’t complain I just kept asking my medical providers to please just keep me good enough to keep caring for my mom. And I couldn’t and wouldn’t share how hard it was with my mom. With her I minimized what she saw (what I couldn’t hide) everything I could hide from her I did. Because why show her that? It would only make her feel crappier that she needed my care. It was hard enough getting her to ask for what she needed or would like if she knew how hard it was for me she wouldn’t ever ask for anything.  We spent years like that. I guess I could have chosen any number of ways to see my situation and to see myself and my plight in this situation but I really didn’t feel there was much of a choice if I wanted personal happiness and a sense of peace in my life…which is how I thrive. I could have felt sorry for myself and I did at times. Indeed I had a number of dark moments (which I will write about in other posts) but I couldn’t thrive there. My nature and my spirit pull me back to a place where I can thrive. At the end of each day I went to bed very grateful for my mom and my dog because without them needing me I surely wouldn’t have gotten out of bed again. Not because I was sad but because physically I was that bad off. Part of me is at times a tad envious of those with great carers where they do have the luxury of not getting out of bed and being cared for but again in the end I was glad I had to…because that kept me going…and still keeps me going to this day.  All the while during these years dementia had developed and was progressing but we didn’t know it. Although I was well aware of my struggles to remain doing certain tasks and what I was losing and articulated this very well to my medical providers no one said the word “dementia” or suggested that I get tested. So this went on and progressed for years with me none the wiser…only aware of my growing losses and my plight of how to keep caring for my mom. But there are saving graces in that. My mom likes to have the exact same routine every day and she eats the exact same thing every day and so the grocery list is always the same. As I had now been doing this for years this was a set pattern and still is the most easiest pattern for me to follow in my day. It is much easier for me to care for her than for myself.  The whole decade before now (as I still care for my mom) I never sought caregiver groups or support. Although I have met a few along the way. It wasn’t until I was finally diagnosed with dementia (of all the things I thought it might be never did I think that) that I came online and found (because that is pretty much all there is) caregiver support. But what I found shocked me again an understatement. In truth I did not understand how in the world these people could view caregiving in the way that they do I was horrified and hurt and deeply concerned for the people they care for. And it is not that they are bad people I truly believe that they are unaware of how their point of view (that is a mass point of view an agreement) negatively impacts their situation their loved one and ultimately themselves. I felt I needed to say something to change this for them but what?  To me caring for my mom is the highest act of love I have ever experienced. There is nothing quite like holding a dirty diaper or being handed her denture to clean…but again of all the ways I could view it I settle on the one that is the highest act of love. How would I want my teeth or diaper to be handled? How would I like to be bathed? How would I like my food to be prepared? And that is how I do it with the same loving care I give myself and gave my children when they were young. I don’t do this for my mom for glory. I don’t feel it gives me any rights. I do it for no other reason than she needs it. I cared for my children the same way because they needed it…and when it is hard you just rise up and find a way…and because it is just what you do for each other. I don’t see myself as special in this role I just see her need…and I am grateful daily (and indeed multiple times a day) to be still able to meet her needs. It is not like it is not a battle to rise up beyond my physical handicap or stretch beyond my brain dysfunction…it is just that I don’t live in the battle instead I live in her need and in the pleasure of meeting her need.  When my mom had to go to the ER and they were going to admit her she was scared. As a midwestern WWII family we were not touchy feely people esp my mom wasn’t. She reached out to hold my hand and I answered that by taking her hand in mine…she did not let go all night. I thought my arm would fall off but I would not have traded a minute of that for anything. I was the one she reached for and that is likely all the thanks I will get…and indeed it is all the thanks I need.  When people read my writing or meet me or listen to what I have to say rarely do they realize the person behind what I say. Rarely do they realize that I am a caregiver too…or that I am doing it likely with a much greater handicap than them. But I am.  And it is from here that I speak.

His disease has progressed recently and there are fears for his safety and of course talk of a nursing facility.  I have felt uncomfortable about asking questions because his wife is working with my brother and I think they are doing their best.   When I was informed by a different sibling this evening and asked about home care or other options tempers flared and I was accused of having a hurt ego.  I really do want to help but I feel as though my help is seen as intrusive.   Our family has a history of not being able to communicate effectively with each and unfortunately also poor planning.   When we lost our mother it was fairly similar and I simply stepped in to do things like housekeeping and visiting monthly. My parents would not accept having any of the children be involved in doctor appointments at that time. The brother that has been assisting has said that he wishes he would have consulted with us sooner rather than now as is now a crisis. My understanding is that my brother and my father's wife will be consulting with an attorney first and that they are seeking out what options there might be.   I am wanting to call my dad's wife with whom I have believe I have a good relationship but I have also been told that we don't need ""14 quarterbacks"". I know some of the anger is the processing and pain and the sibling who reacts this way is simply not well equipped to handle these things.  Please advise. Should I call my dad's wife?

They don’t have to begrounded in reality.  There’s no need to re-live their pain. Distraction works.        We don’t know what they canor cannot do; all we can do is guess at their abilities.  We can let themtry but must be alert for frustration agitation and anger.        Making deals doesn’twork.  THEY FORGET.  Just do what needs to be done.        TELL DON’T ASK!  Allthat choices do is confuse and agitate them.        We can’t do it all byourselves.  It’s OK to ask for and receive help and support.        WE’RE NOT PERFECT. Forgiving ourselves and them makes life much more serene.        Separate the PERSON from theDISEASE!  Be grateful for the good times; learn from the bad.        Therapeutic lying may benecessary.  It can prevent much stress.        Doctors don’t see the wholepicture.  We have to tell it like it is.  Then they may also have tolie.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~           PRAYER of SAINT FRANCIS forCAREGIVERS:    Lord make me an instrumentof Your healing care today.    Where there is sorrow       Let me offer myheart in empathy.    Where there is fear       Let me speakquiet assurance.    Where there is anxiety       Let me breathecalm.     Where there is doubt       Let me holdgentle certainty.    Where there is pain       Let my presencebe like a soothing balm.    O Divine Spirit grant meenergy sufficient to do what is required of me.    Grant me wisdom with themoment and endurance with the need.    Make me a steady source ofcompassion embracing the other embracing myself.     May my caregiving be rooted:       Less in controland more in surrender.       Less in constantdoing and more in gentle being.       Less in prideand more in humility.    May I embrace whatever joyscome our way;       Many or few maythey be enough.    May I find meaning in thisrole I serve and fulfillment in how I serve it.    May I always remember thathealing means becoming more whole whatever the form.    May I never forget thathealing is ultimately always a gift.    And You Lord are the sourceof it all.    For that reason I make thisprayer humbly gratefully hopefully confidently.    Amen                  PLEA FROM AN ALZHEIMER’SVICTIM:      Don’t ask me to remember;don’t try to make me understand.

Youhave the right to experience your own unique grief.    No one elsewill grieve in exactly the same way you do. When you turn to others for helpdo not allow them to tell you what you should or should not be feeling. No oneelse’s opinion is important except the griever him or herself.      2.    Youhave the right to talk about your grief.    Talking about yourgrief will help you heal. Seek out others who will allow you to talk as much asyou want about your grief.      3.    Youhave the right to feel a multitude of emotions.    Confusiondisorientation fear guilt and relief are just a few of the emotions you mightfeel as part of your grief journey. Others may try to tell you that feelingangry for example is wrong. Do not take these judgmental responses to heart.Instead find listeners who will accept your feelings without criticismanalysis or judgment.      4.    Youhave the right to be tolerant of your physical and emotional limits.    Yourfeelings of loss and sadness will probably leave you feeling fatigued. Respectwhat your body and mind are telling you. Get daily rest and eat balanced meals.Do not allow others to push you into doing things you do not feel ready to do.      5.    Youhave the right to experience grief “attacks”.    Sometimes out ofnowhere a powerful surge of grief may over come you. This can be frighteningbut is normal and natural. Find someone who understands and will let you talkit out. Remember grief is the normal and natural reaction to a loss orsignificant change in your life’s journey.      6.    Youhave the right to make use of ritual.    The funeral ritual doesmore than acknowledge the death of someone loved. It helps provide the mournerwith the support of caring people. More important the funeral ritual is a wayto begin the mourning process. If well-meaning people in your life tell youthat rituals such as these are silly or unnecessary don’t listen.      7.    Youhave the right to embrace your spirituality.    If faith is a partof your life express it in ways that seem appropriate to you. Allow yourselfto be around people who understand and support your religious beliefs. If youfeel angry with GD find someone to talk with who won’t judge you criticizeyou or hurt your feelings.      8.    Youhave the right to search for meaning.    It is natural to findyourself asking “why this happened?” or “why now?” some questions may haveanswers and some may not. Watch for the clichéd responses from well meaningfolks like “…is in a better place.” “You have to be strong for …” These areunhelpful comments that do more harm than good. Remember you do not have tolisten to this.      9.    Youhave the right to treasure your memories.    Memories are one ofthe best legacies that exist after the death of someone loved. Find goodfriends and family members that you can share your memories with. You willalways remember.      10.    Youhave the right to move toward your grief and journey towards healing.    Workingthrough your grief will not happen quickly. Be kind to yourself. Listen to yourbody and be patient and tolerant with yourself. Avoid people who are impatientand intolerant with you. Surround yourself with caring people who will validateyour feelings and listen to you.,False,George K,2011-12-16,2820.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147524226,,,AlzConnected,,,

He was walking with his 1:1 aide and when he got back to his room it was locked they told him he had a new room and he got agitated upset and confused. They have him in a room with a much younger man who looks very ill.   Last night dad called and asked me to pick him up and bring him home. I tried to tell him he is not discharged yet and he was yelling and upset. I tried to calm him telling him that we are waiting to get him into rehab to get stronger and it will be better there as we can bring his own clothes and his military records to look through.

Not too long ago Mom quit getting out of her bed or chair by herself. She used to get up and walk all around in the house. It seemed so sudden. Now when you try to help her out of bed she says ""ow ow dont dont!"" but when she's standing up she can walk fine. And helping her out of a chair is tough! At least for me. She resists and says ""ow don't pull!""...then she sometimes won't straighten her legs and stand when I get her up. But it seemed she did better with my dad about standing up. With my brother she still says ""ow don't!"".....so I don't know if she's really in pain or not. She also seems to understand what my brother and I are saying less than she did. She just gives us a blank look and keeps saying ""huh?"". She didn't do that before. She has also seemed to quit moving her body by herself as much...and she sometimes leans to one side when she's sitting. She can't sit up straight it seems. But sometimes she can.

Hard to fathom her tolerating that without being placed into a medically induced coma.  The neurosurgeon says she is not a great candidate for surgery because of arthritis in neck and cognitive state and has decided to place her in a neck brace.    Anyway...we are trying to stabilize her pain AND manage the high anxiety while still allowing her to be alert enough to eat! Anyone have any magic combinations?! Mom also hates taking mess by mouth so they have decided on fentanyl patch for pain but the agitation has not been able to be consistently controlled.  She has ripped the brace off herself a few times already. Meds seem to cause hallucinations and that could pose a fall risk as well.  My brother is a pharmacist so he is very on top of all that she is given.

My mom was diagnosed with AD 2+ years ago.  She's 83 years old.  In February 2015 she had a 2-week stay in inpatient psych unit after a UTI in December 2014 left her with hallucinations/profound depression/paranoid delusions.  They put her on Remeron and those issues cleared up and have stayed away.  She is also on seroquel aricept namenda blood pressure meds lasix potassium supplement a thyroid medication and vitamins (I might have missed something but these are the basic ones).  She lives at home with Dad (who is slowing down but doesn't have AD) and doing pretty well actually.  She sits and watches TV for most of the day.  Dad takes care of her meds makes her meals etc.  She walks slowly is bored but can still feed herself has no issues with incontinence she can get dressed (although doesn't see the stains on her clothes or holes in her socks).  I do go over to give her baths and trim her nails and try to visit a couple times a week.  In 2015 she had cataract surgery - twice - one for each eye several months apart.  She also was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a left mastectomy.  She currently has no recollection of any of her surgeries or her 2-week stay in the hospital.  Each time I give her a bath and she notices her left breast is gone she realizes it's missing and after I explain she says ""Well no one told me!""  but she doesn't seem too alarmed about it otherwise.  When we get ready to go to a doctor's appointment she'll ask if it's for her eyes.  I remind her she already had that fixed then promptly do a quick vision check and of course she sees everything just fine.

So my question is - is she is truly having back pain?  Or is this perhaps just something her brain 'remembers' and so she brings it up?  Kind of like that missing breast she can't ""see clearly"" until I do a quick vision check etc.?  Again she doesn't complain about it until you ask how she's doing.  A friend had called her yesterday and then called me last night concerned because every time she talks to my mom she says mom says her back hurts.  of course mom also tells this friend her breast is missing and she can't see and the friend knows mom's had surgery for all that.    so I'm just curious if this is just part of the process.    thanks!",False,romiha,2014-12-21,564.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523828,,,AlzConnected,,,

My dad was always an active man.  He never had arthritis or joint pain of any type.  I have never seen him limp or have any muscle pain.  And through this disease process we really have done fine.  But this final stage is a whole other story and the PAIN that I never saw coming.  As everyone knows my dad is in the final stage of this disease.  He has been bed bound for nearly two years.  We do range of motion exercise twice daily.  We haven't had any skin breakdown or any bedsores and up until this time haven't ever seen him express any pain signals.   Dad doesn't at this time have contractures.  When asked if he has any pain he always said ""No.""   But this week while rolling him for a brief change boy did he cry out.  It was simply painful watching his agony.  Any movement/rolling/turning seems to cause strong pain.  Our perception of this is that it is caused by the rigidity and severe weight loss.    I immediately called his doctor who has ordered morphine drops.    Any other ideas or experiences would be greatly appreciated.  This was the PAIN I never saw coming.",False,His Daughter,2014-06-25,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523575,,,AlzConnected,,,

I originally had intended to search out suggestions for help with daily hygiene for my MIL but as I sit here the tears are building I am admitting this life change is way harder emotionally than I ever expected I am admitting I could use support from those who know.      I am in my mid 50's and my hubby mid 60's we have a 12 yr old special needs grandson who has been with us since birth.  My sweet 90yr old mother in law with dementia came to stay with us only 2 months ago after a fall with a spinal compression fracture. Until this last fall she lived alone with supportive neighbors and friends hubby did all her shopping and visited her 3x a week we knew her Dementia was getting worse but we had no clue how bad it really was until just a couple days here under our 24/7 care.    The 1st month was the hardest as of course as she couldn't remember her walker (still can't) and that one of us needs to be with her at all times (to catch her falls) and new to all this we didn't have the bedside potty set up yet and we had to do night shifts for her 12 to 20 potty runs each night.  We got through that along with all her day appoints PT OT etc. despite neither of us having any white to our eyes I'm sure you can all relate.    The second month we were getting the hang of things got a bedside potty so we can get some sleep and I listen through a monitor for any trouble at night. Grandson is adjusting well to all the changes in the home giving up his bedroom etc. Though her memory consistantly declines my kiddo has been my savior my eyes out when I need to step into another room.  (Hubby still has a full time job)  She needs help with every aspect of daily living.  Here is where I am feeling sick with guilt and I really hate to say this but I think a twinge of resentment I'm not sure what it is.     My own mother @78 extremely independent a nurse most her life and home caregiver still was having leg pain (PAD onset) and it was getting in the way of her ability to care for the other elders pushing them in wheelchairs etc.   So just before Thanksgiving she had a simple angioplasty scheduled to clear a slight blockage in her leg.   Me being an only child my dad passed years ago and the only family in California I HATED that I couldn't take her to her appointment because I had to be here 90 min. drive away with MIL.  She found a friend to pick her up take her for the procedure and soon as my hubby got home from taking the kids to school I was able to rush to the hospital to be there during the procedure &amp; so I could be there to bring her home here for her 24 watch after -  LOL we laughed about having 2 momma's on the mend at my house.  She assured me she understood that my priority was here with my MIL.  Yet I feel soooo guilty.   My moms procedure went south and 2 emergency surgeries later she was on life support  the following day when my adult children were able to get there from out of town we took her off the support and she passed with minutes.  My husband could not be with us at the hospital for that 24 hours from hell to support me and the kids because he needed to be home taking care of his mother and he has tremendous guilt even though we all know that's just the way it had to be.  Talk about being a rock and hard place -  how does one get over the guilt of having to choose the needs of one loved one over another?   I am totally dedicated to providing good and loving care for my mother in law  I have willingly changed my/our life so I can do that with integrity and focus.  I try to smile through the simple things like the fact that with no time to myself it took me 3 weeks to do 1 hour of paperwork regarding my mothers estate.  Hubby took another day off &amp; I was able to leave 1 afternoon in the last month to pick up my mother cremains and here they sit above my desk no one even knows they are there  no plans for a celebration of life and no idea of when I might have time to do that for her friends  I have not even been able to grieve  yet I try to help my kids and my grandson with their grief I have not been able to go to my mothers home and just sit and absorb my loss sort though things  I miss her.  My MIL forgets sometimes forgets my mom died but remembers she is wearing my moms clothes because she really likes them and often tells me to tell her thank you  .  I am piled high with paperwork for my MIL&amp; my mom (though thank god I finely got all their bills on auto pay) but still trying to grab a minute here and there do the paperwork for supportive services for MIL  I suppose I should be doing that now instead of complaining here.   I am trying to make a good Christmas for my grandson (thank god for online shopping) and we'll play games look at pictures and talk about my mom she obviously won't be here this year and I do think it will be hard for me telling MIL ""why"" she's not here at least 10 or 20 times.  BUT I WILL continue do my best even though all I want to do is go crawl in a hole somewhere.  I suppose I'm just overwhelmed as I'm sure all of you are but  I sure could use some words of wisdom to help me with ""keeping my chin up"" on this new journey  .",False,searchgal,2015-12-21,4.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523650,,,AlzConnected,,,

It was 10:48pm.  I didn't cry.  I just sat and talked to him held his hand kissed him and told him I was sorry that he had to go through this and that I'd done the best that I could.   I called the family and Duane's Entertainment Committee everyone was there very quickly. Our care group washed his body and hair shaved his face brushed his teeth and one final time lotioned his skin.  We put his clothes on.  Then each of the family and the care team had their alone time.   I called the city coroner and she released his body.  Many hours later I called the funeral home and they came to get him at 3:00am.  Our group stayed at the house till around 5:00am telling stories laughing and crying.  My son got a bottle of Bourbon and we shared a toast in his honor.  My family slept at the house.  The next few days were a whirlwind.  Even though I had spent 2 years planning the service there are so many last minute things that needed to be done.  (As others have said PLEASE preplan the service.)   Our viewing was the evening of December 22nd.  I knew that seeing my father in a casket would be tough so I avoided it and kept my focus on the memory table.  But eventually I had to do it.  So I went to the  casket and the first thing I noticed was how good he looked.......but they had brushed his hair wrong!!!!!   It was the very best thing that could have happened.  In that moment I immediately went back into advocate and caregiver mode.  I ran to the desk and said ""Someone has got to get me a brush and a comb immediately.""   A woman came in with a brush and comb in hand and I brushed his hair as it should be.   That small mistake allowed me the opportunity to get outside my own grief and once again be his advocate.   The service I had planned for two years was to be a celebration ceremony.  I had written a eulogy based on his dash.  I knew it had to come from a place of strength with a smile on my face as I spoke about the man I love.   I will admit  that morning I was a hot mess and not certain I'd be able to  do it.  As I sat in a back room I kept reminding myself that this was the last thing I could do to honor him.  Somehow I sucked up my grief put it in a box and sat it on a shelf and yes I did deliver his eulogy with a smile on my face.    We went to the gravesite with full military honor.  A twenty one gun salute and taps.  Then back to the funeral home for a lunch with music provided by our singer who had come to the house several times.  And yes we got up and danced to all of Dad's favorite tunes.    This was everything I had wanted.  My dad died in his own home in his own bed quietly with His Daughter right by his side.  He was loved and surrounded by family.   We never treated a disease we simply supported a man.   There is not a moment of these years I would give up. In fact that time is the only thing holding me up right now.     Thank you everyone for all your love and support.  I couldn't have asked for better friends.   His Daughter                                                                                                                          Gail",False,His Daughter,2014-06-25,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523749,,,AlzConnected,,,

As usual my dad continues to follow his own path and side sets the standard rules.  On Friday morning he was clearly having difficulty with his respiration and he was mottled from the abdomen down.  However while that often indicates that a person will die within the next 48 hours NOT MY DAD.  Nope the mottling went away and his breathing got better.    Yesterday we unfortunately had some rude teenagers who came and dumped 9 bags of the leaves we had raked all over the drive way and bashed in the mailbox.  But my boys were here that morning loading all the mess in my son's truck and the mailbox was replaced in short order.    In the afternoon my daughter called and set up our singer to come at 3:00pm.  I cuddled my dad in bed and our family enjoyed all the wonderful Christmas songs together.   We are doing the best that we can.  He is still home and not showing any outward signs of pain.  I am now here permanently until this is done.  My Entertainment Committee and my family are helping us through.    Again thank you for all your thoughts and  prayers.  And I will continue to keep you updated.

I can't stress enough to all of you out there with LOs with problems swallowing that g-tubes are more than likely NOT the way to go.  This thing has brought my poor sister more pain and grief than anything else. It just prolongs the inevitable and the suffering in conditions that are terminal.  The only saving grace to her dementia is that by Thanksgiving when I was with her I think she had already forgotten what had happened the day before and the discomfort she had on Wednesday.  I at least pray that.  Just kept reinforcing to her that Sunday we'd have her big ""Christmas decorating party.""  We're putting up her little tree in her room with snowflakes &amp; decorations on the walls to make it bright &amp; cheery for the holidays.  While doing that we always play Christmas music which really helps pull out her mind.  She was happy about it Thursday.  Now just hoping we can keep that darn tube in place.

Mom (early-mid stage Alz)  used to get migraines 2-3 times a week. Two years ago she started taking Topamax for migraine prevention and this reduced her migraines down to 1 every 2-3 months.  In the last couple of months she has become more and more confused and anxious and her psychiatrist advised that she discontinue the Topamax because it is known to cause problems with cognition. He told me we would need to consult with her primary care doc to determine if there is a different med she can take that doesn't have that side effect. We have to wait until next week to see him so while we wait I thought I'd see what I can find out online. Do any of you have experience with any migraine prevention meds that don't cause cognitive impairment? The problem is complicated by the fact that Mom isn't supposed to take NSAIDS for pain because her kidneys are weak and the Tramadol she was prescibed for pain also causes cognitive impairment.

He has NPH had the shunt installed but we all know it's a temporary help.  He is 85.  He made the mistake of insisting on leaving his Assisted Living and buying a house a couple months ago.  He has been falling and injured his hip - it is not broken - but super painful due to necrotic tissue related to bad arthritis.      So he now wants to go back to the assisted living he was in - they have room for him.  But I am not sure he will be able to go back.  He is going to rehab to see if they can get him to move with a walker and not fall and to try and treat his severe pain.  My sense (sister agrees) that he is wheelchair bound.  I am not sure he can go back to the Assisted Living like that.      I have posted before that I do not have a typical father daughter relationship with him.  He pretty much abandoned my sister and I as we were teens and married a series of women where he ""adopted"" their kids as his insisting that they were such great kids.  He even does this now though none of them have anything to do with him and are not about to help him.        I feel bad that my sister is stuck helping him (I am in Boston he is on the west coast near her) but we agreed to do the minimum for him but now she is treating him like a real dad.  It's her choice but I said I would not be treating him like my mom when she was ill.  I did make several trips to handle his evaluation and shunt installation so I feel like I have done my part.  Now he is delusional also feels like the shunt is what made him worse....

We did this so that we could deal with any bill collectors scam artist and the like my father now lacked the wherewithal do deal with in his current state. In April of this year we met with a neurologist who agreed that it was time to take Dads drivers license away and this is where the biggest pain in my family and myselves lives began.   Dad wont give up the ghost on the drivers license thing and on subsequently getting a new car. To say the least he has begun to make a fool of himself calling doctors offices multiple times a day (to where they will no longer even call me back) continually calling the secretary of states office up calling car dealerships and even banks to arrange a car loans.   Yesterday things got really bad and I had to basically call banks up and even his pension board to explain that Dad is not well and that he doesn't even have a drivers license anymore and I doubt ever will again let alone buy a car. So I'm basically trying to work full time and having to use my lunch hours to do damage control from people he is calling all day.    Finally late yesterday afternoon my sister and I had enough and contacted his phone company to place a temporary freeze on his telephone to stop the madness. I feel bad having to do it (although he does have access to the facilities phone if need be)  but at the same time he is using it to create havok in hopes that if he makes a big enough pain of himself we will just give in and let him have the license back and a car.    I guess I decided to hop on here today to see if anyone else has had to do this or been trapped in a never ending argument to where no matter how many family members friends and even doctors tell our Dementia diagnosed Dad something he just refuses to believe it. In his case that he even has dementia to begin with and that his drivers license is long gone.  Also I was wondering if anyone had this phone issue and how they dealt with it. I know years ago they use to make a kids phone that only only had a few buttons of pre-set numbers and allowed the child to call only those numbers plus 911. Something like that would be great for my Dad especially with our current issue.   Thank you in advance if you took the time to read these ramblings of a flustered son and if you have anything that can help my family and I cope.,False,FlusteredSon,2015-11-11,9.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147522029,,,AlzConnected,,,

He has a condition that can turn into Leukemia. And looking up the symptoms of it he has quite a few of them. Like the bone and joint pain extreme fatigue appetite loss extreme weight loss and very pale skin. And yet so far nobody at his retirement place doesn't want to really do anything about it.

I decided to reach out because I really need to talk about what's been going on and maybe get some advice. Been taking care of my mom since 2011 because she was forgetting to take her meds and nearly died. Overall its been OK but over the last few months its gotten really bad. My mom has gotten obssessed with her purse and money. She has coins in various places in the house and moves the money around forgets and then acusses me of stealing it. She also misplaces stuff and then says I threw it away. Aside from this she is fair functional and we live in an apartment together. We are definitely low income.  Yesterday seemed a good day right until I got ready to go to work and my mom started yelling that I had stolen her coins. I've tried ignoring what she says but the pain and sadness really hurt and I'm afraid that I will lash back at her. When I get home from work she is apologetic without really admitting she did anything wrong. This is starting to affect me with me having bouts of depression despite my best efforts to control my feelings. I'm going to talk to her doctor today to fill her in what's been happening at home. As we are poor I'm not sure what options exists for care as I don't think a nurse at home would help. I've read some posts about lockdown facilities but think those are out of price range due to her social security being just $750 a month. I feel lost powerless sad and angry very often now and almost feel like walking away but that would condemn her to death as there is no other family to help her. Sorry if this is a bit rambly but I feel like I'm getting close to the end of my rope and am hoping for some advice.

802,62106d257b65de9a5b66b529,2147521190,2015-10-09 01:43:00,Long......We're Back on Hospice,"Well here I am again.  It's been a while.  The last two times I checked the message boards I saw posts from two people I remember when I first joined this board.  They had both recently lost their LO.    Last week 9/29 at about 1 a.m. I got a call that mom was having difficulty breathing.  She was on hospice two years ago rallied was discharged February 2014 and has been relatively content and in slow decline with the occasional UTI. She was still DNR.       I went over to evaluate.  I didn't want to transport her to the ER.  I promised her I would never do that again after the last time 2 years ago.  It's so hard on her and she doesn't understand what's going on.  However her breathing sounded like she was drowning she was unresponsive and unable to assist with transfer couldn't lift her arms look you in the eye or squeeze your hand.  Staff reported her BP at 58/35.  They checked it twice to be sure.  After observing her and trying to encourage her to cough I decided we needed to call 911.  Without hospice we had no way to make her comfortable.  I suspect CHF and felt horrible that we wouldn't have suction anxiety meds nothing to help her.     She did have a couple episodes of weak but productive coughing by the time the aid crew arrived.  Her BP had somewhat stabilized and her breathing sounded slightly improved.  They suggested that transporting might not be the best thing for her considering her POLST that she didn't seem in discomfort or pain and that we could call for an emergency hospice eval in a few hours. I decided that was best and they said if anything changed to just call them and they would come back to transport. I stayed for a couple more hours with her and then the night staff said they were done with chores and would sit with her so I could get a little sleep before morning.  My mom is in an adult family home with one resident staff on site and one awake staff 24 hours.     The owner came on shift at 6 a.m. so at 6:30 I called to discuss our plan.  I was going to call the Dr. office and request an emergency hospice evaluation.  But when I spoke with her (the owner) she felt that mom needed transport to ER.  She suspected pneumonia and said that they would probably give her antibiotics and send her home.  Well in my state of no sleep and stress I agreed.  I hoped that they might at least be able to make her more comfortable.  Because of my mom's insurance type I had to deal with the insurance company nurse on call first.  She was going to arrange either a cabulance or ambulance and would call me back with an ETA.  Long story short I never got the call and the ambulance arrived without my being there.  I said I would meet them at the hospital.     Keep in mind that her POLST says no invasive treatment and antibiotics for comfort only.  They were just unloading her as I drove into the parking lot.  I used the ER ""hotline"" once inside and the ER staff said they were just accepting her and please could I finish her registration process at the front. OK.  When I was done I called again.  They said she was down having xrays. WHAT?  Quickly I thought it through.  She was relatively healthy aside from the dementia.  If she did have a CHF episode as I suspected having that diagnosis might help her be accepted onto hospice.  So when he said they would come get me when she got back I just said OK.     After 40 or so minutes I called back again.  He said they were just setting up her heart monitor and would come get me as soon as she was settled.  Another 20 plus minutes and I called again.  They buzzed me in this time.       I got to her room in time to see the nurse finish injecting a solution into an IV in her arm and hanging an IV bag.  I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the injection and bag were two different antibiotics for the pneumonia (which I didn't know she had) and he was going to give her an aspirin to chew for her heart.  I said that she was late stage dementia with a DNR treatment was to be for comfort care she didn't appear to be able to swallow at the moment so the aspirin was probably not a good idea I was her POA and to please get a doctor so I could discuss this with them before you do anything else.     The doctor appeared and explained that it looked like she had pneumonia.  Her cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated so they wanted to give the aspirin and that they were admitting her for observation.  I said that I wanted to discuss discharge options with social services to include being discharged with hospice services.  I said the only reason she was here was because there were no services in place where she lived and they were concerned they could not keep her comfortable.     Fast forward a few hours to a room on the general med/surg floor.  The hospitalist arrived to discuss her treatment plan to include IV hydration antibiotics and heart medicine.  She had indeed had a heart attack but it didn't appear she was in CHF.  Her lungs sounded pretty good considering.  It seemed that she had likely aspirated her oral secretions and that her swallowing was compromised so that was why she sounded like she was drowning.  I know this doctor because he used to be my GP and I have found his treatment philosophy to be greatly influenced by his religion and he has a very poor bedside manner.     He explained that she should've been transferred to telemetry (ICU) instead of the general floor.  Her room was ready and they would be moving her shortly.  Her POLST clearly states that ""ICU is to be avoided if at all possible""!  Did anyone even refer to it?       I quickly learned that once the hospital treatment train has left the station it is very hard to put on the brakes.  He told me without this treatment she would die.  I was torn.  She had been sitting at the dining room table just the night before enjoying her dinner self feeding sucking on a tootsie pop etc.      I needed a moment to think!  I told him I needed to have a few moments and consult my brother.  He said they would go ahead and move her to ICU and I should let him know what we decided after I talked to my brother.  I only live a few blocks from the hospital so I ran home to grab the binder with all her legals in it (I left in a rush and forgot it on the counter).  Her advance directives state no artificial hydration if she is in the advanced stage of a terminal illness or otherwise vegetative state.  Dementia is not clear cut like cancer.  Is it a terminal illness?  I was struggling for an answer.  My brother said he thought we should follow her AD but that he was fine with ""whatever"" I decided.  That's an easy answer when you're not standing bedside of the person you're making decisions for.     Back at the hospital.  They had already ordered the medications from the pharmacy and the clot busting heart medication was on the table waiting to be hung.  I explained to the doctor about her advance directives.  He said they are basically meaningless ""from a legal standpoint"".  WTH is that supposed to mean?  I expressed my concern that she couldn't swallow wouldn't hydrating her make aspiration and choking an even greater risk?  She wasn't clinically dehydrated but he said that without IV fluids the treatment wouldn't work.  I still don't know if that's really accurate.  I asked how she could already have pneumonia since it had been less than a day since she aspirated.  He said her swallowing had likely been compromised for a while allowing small amounts or oral secretions or liquids to trickle into her lungs.  She hadn't shown any outward signs of pneumonia at all in the days prior.     I finally agreed to treatment not sure if I was doing her a favor or disservice. Were we doing these things only to have her never be able to swallow thereby only extending the time it would take for her to die naturally once off of IV fluids because she could not take food or water orally?  Or would she have a major rebound?     I watched them hang the bag and sat there while it dripped down to empty.  The whole time I felt it might be wrong.  I searched my soul and prayed for guidance.  I don't regularly pray but when stuff hits the fan I ask for help and sometimes it clears my head.  Mom was still unresponsive.  She would open her eyes but look through you.       Suddenly her IV monitor started beeping.  There was about 1/2 an inch of medication left.  The nurse came and decided her IV was occluding positionally adjusted her arm and the beeping stopped.  This happened every 1 or 2 minutes for the next 30 minutes. They decided they would need to retap a new IV before hanging the fluids.  While we waited for the bag to empty I asked the nurse to go over her blood labs with me.  Her red cell and other red blood markers were low indicating some small bleed.  Her BUN was high and her cardiac enzymes had skyrocketed.  I told them not to hang the other bag.  The nurse came to me and hugged me and told me what a wonderful daughter I was.  I burst into tears.     I had the doctor come back to discuss this with him.  I said we were to go with comfort measures only.  He asked that if she should ""wake up"" could he offer her food and water because he ""wouldn't want her to go hungry"".  I don't know it bothered me that he put it that way.  Anyway I said yes. The he asi if she could swallow could he continue the antibiotic orally as well since it had already been started.  I said yes.     So in the morning she was able to take some medicine crushed in apple sauce.  She was discharged back to the AFH with oral antibiotics and accepted onto hospice.  That was a week ago.     I have stated no more antibiotic treatment after this round.  When she was ""awake"" at the hospital she would try to talk and just cry.  Sometimes she can form words and most of the time she asks for my dad who has been dead for seven years.  She is eating a little yogurt and drinking a little thickened juice.  You almost always have to remind her to swallow.  She tends to hold it in her mouth.  Sometimes she can't get it up the straw so I capture some in the straw and drop it in her mouth like a bird.     She still smiles sometimes especially when the staff tell her she is being naughty.  She has a very mischievous grin.     The AFH owner said death is not certain or close and that she might just need more rest and could still have a major rebound. I hope it and fear it at the same time.     She still has urine output and is still taking in small amounts of food and liquids.  Her vitals are good according to AFH owner but I know her O2 sats were in the 80s a week ago when the hospice nurse came.  She took her last antibiotic today.  When I visited tonight I noticed her forehead was warm and there is a strong smell of ketones about her.  She was just waking up and the aid had uncovered her because she was too warm. After a while I checked her legs which had developed goosebumps but still her forehead felt slightly feverish.  She hadn't had a fever since a week ago Wednesday. I have said no more antibiotics.  She's had three different kinds already. I feel it's the right choice but doubt continues to creep in.     I've read all the materials but I still have questions about this stage when complicated with an illness like this and feel the need to hear the experiences of others.  If anyone is willing to share with me I would appreciate it right now.  I don't know what to expect.  I feel like we're in this awful limbo.

Then life besides Deb comes into play.  Besides my job I haven't had a lot of life besides Deb for 12 years.  However I have a long-time friend now grieving because her 31 year old son just died of Lymphoma.  He was married with two little boys - 2 &amp; 4 years old.  He was also a police officer.  I'm going to the visitation &amp; funeral for that this weekend.  My heart aches for her.  I also had to recently take a $6 an hour pay cut.  That hurts us financially and though Deb is Medicare/Medicaid qualified we've still spent a lot of money to make sure she's comfortable incidentals and other needs for her.  Not complaining about that.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  It all just adds to the stress.  My own body is crying out at me.  My Rheumatoid Arthritis worsens by the day - it seems. I haven't known for years what it's like to have a day without physical pain and I cover it up each &amp; every day I see Deb and go to work.   My rheumatologist tells me it's due to such a suppressed immune system and ""chronic stress.""  I can't go on any stronger meds because of being in a skilled facility daily.  It'd suppress my immune system more &amp; I'd get sicker than I do now.  It's one big cycle.  Haven't been to my pain management doc since Deb went into skilled care &amp; on hospice THREE years ago.  I'm just venting.  I think a lot about the writing His Daughter did on being strong.  There are many days I feel the strength is gone.  I somehow just keep going through the motions every day.  I wonder if there will be life after Deb and am ashamed of those feelings but over 12 years of having her in my care - with 3 years of it being very intense - has just about done  me in.  I keep asking my husband ""What will happen to Deb if I die before her?""  Some days I really worry about that.  You all have been my lifeline.  Even when I go long stretches without posting I'm still here almost daily reading.  God bless you all and provide you the strength to deal with all the stress of being a caregiver for someone you love so very much.  Thank you for the support and prayers you've given to Deb and me.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147521746,,,AlzConnected,,,

This is Deb's SECOND time on hospice and she's been on for End Stage Down Syndrome since August 2014.  The hospice nurse told me that as things looked Deb will come OFF hospice on October 8.  She was so upset herself.  She said ""Pam they MADE me call you.  I didn't want to do it.""  The problem appear to be she's ""dying too slowly for Medicare guidelines.""  At the time of the call I felt SO bad for her hospice nurse.  Her own mother is dying right now and she's off work until next Wednesday because evidently they expect her own mother to pass by then.  I told her that we'd deal with it.  She told me they are going to a Palliative Care Program on October 2 and Deb could transition to that until she qualified again.  She did say however it was 100% certain that she would go off.  Their nurse practitioner is going in to see Deb TODAY to give her a really good ""once over"" before it's actually ""official.""  However because she hadn't really lost any more weight and hadn't had any infections she was just ""dying too slowly to qualify.""  I talked to hospice's admin nurse yesterday about things especially because Deb reports DAILY she has chest pain.  They are going to address the chest pain today and ""probably"" order a chest x-ray to see if the Congestive Heart Failure is acting up.  SOMETHING is acting up.  That poor little thing has chest pain every single day and evidently the Motrin they've been giving her for it isn't doing the trick anymore.  Her charge nurse at the SNF has been off most of the week.  However she is on duty today.  THANK GOD.  I texted her what was happening yesterday.  She told me that she doesn't think it will happen.  She'll pull out every stop she possibly can to keep her on and said she has faith she will NOT go off.  When I see Deb after work yesterday she was in her room chair sleeping.  She awoke shortly after I came in.  The first thing she asked me was ""When Kim be back?""  (Kim's the charge nurse.)  I told her that she'd be back on Thursday tomorrow.  Then she looked at me teary and said ""Pammy my chest hurts.""  I just held her for the longest time.  I told her she was due for medicine at 6:00PM (it was only 4:30PM) &amp; asked if she could wait.  She said she would.  She closed her eyes during our visit quite a bit &amp; kept rubbing her right eye.  Finally before I left she said ""Pammy my eyes hurt.""  I looked at them.  The right one looked red &amp; irritated.  I told her she was due for eye drops at 8PM but I would tell the nurse to give them to her at 6PM when she comes to give her meds &amp; feed her.  She was SO exhausted.  I made sure to let the nurse on duty know everything and unfortunately it was probably one of the worst nurses in the SNF on that floor yesterday.  As a matter of fact Deb's charge nurse had seen to it that yesterday would be her LAST day on that floor.    As I left yesterday I felt as if I have failed Deb.  When I signed her back up on hospice the second time I hesitated before signing the papers.  The hospice rn told me that I didn't have to sign them if I wasn't ready.  I told her that I was more than ready - my hesitation was them pulling out AGAIN.  I remember clear as day her saying to me ""Oh that can't happen this time.  She's now End Stage Down Syndrome.""  So I signed the papers.  Now they tell me she's not ""dying fast enough.""  They definitely agree she's dying - just not fast enough for Medicare.  I'm heartsick.  Oh and the Palliative Program?  It doesn't start October 2 - which would mean she could just transition right into it.  It starts NOVEMBER 2 - about a 3 week break in between going off hospice.  Should she go off October 8 it will absolutely devastate her to lose the hospice aide at the very most.  I don't know she'll let anyone from the nursing home bathe her now.  Again I feel I've failed her.  She counts on me to take care of her - I tell her daily I'll ALWAYS take care of her - and then this happens.  So my dear friends your prayers are MUCH needed today as her charge nurse tries to pull out every trick and miracle in the book to make her recertify.  The charge nurse tells me there ""NO WAY she should go off hospice.  She's WAY TOO FAR into the dying process now.""  PLEASE pray the charge nurse is right and can get them to keep her on.  I can't bear the thought of dealing with Deb's heartbreak over this.  She definitely won't understand why they left her.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147521027,,,AlzConnected,,,

We STILL have no answer but a little clearer light.  The nurse practitioner from hospice was not able to go in and see Deb today.  She now plans on going tomorrow afternoon.  She did however call the SNF and talk at length to Deb's charge nurse.  Deb's charge nurse was ready and loaded for bear.  She wants her to stay on hospice as bad as I do and believes it is the right thing for her.  Well the hospice nurse practitioner told the charge the nurse the problem actually lies with Medicaid.  They've come up with stiffer guidelines for people who have been on a long time.  If they can just find ANYTHING new or wrong - it will help certify her.  So today I authorized both a chest x-ray and a full blood work up.  She got the chest x-ray while I was there today.  I hopefully will have the results of that tomorrow.  With all the chest pain she's complaining of coupled with the coughing she's been doing they suspect it's the congestive heart failure.  If they see in the x-ray it has returned it will be Deb's golden ticket.  They know they can't give her Lasix again to treat it since the last time she got a life threatening seizure on it.  If they find undiagnosed pneumonia it will recertify her.  ANYTHING in that x-ray could help in the process.  They're doing the bloodwork in hopes that if nothing turns up in the x-ray something will in the bloodwork.  Deb's day went like this today:  She slept completely through her 9AM and 12PM tube feedings.  Her blood pressure this morning had dropped to 80/42.  The hospice aide came in to see her at 1:15PM.  The hospice aide was able to arouse her and ask her if she wanted her shower.  Deb did want it.  They got her up for the shower but she was so weak everything shook.  The hospice aide showered her &amp; then did her hair.  That wore her out.  She didn't want to leave her room.  The nurse gave her a feeding at 3PM &amp; she'd only take 1/2 (TWO ounces of Ensure).  She complained to the nurse her chest hurt.  The nurse gave her a dose of Tylenol in between Motrin doses.  Deb was back asleep by 3:30PM.  I got there @ 4:30PM &amp; immediately met with the charge nurse.  The aide kept going down to her room to see if she had awoken because she would be upset I wasn't there yet.  She STILL hadn't woken up from the 3:30PM nap.  I went in her room at 5PM.  She was sound asleep in her room chair.  A few minutes later she awoke and was very disoriented.  She was worried about my husband because he's had a head cold and unable to come all week.  We again as we've had to do all week called him on my cell phone &amp; put it on speaker phone for her to talk to him.  She barely responded to anything he said to her.    The charge nurse came back in at 6PM to feed her.  She told the nurse her eyes hurt so she went to get her allergy eye drops &amp; put them in her eyes.  Deb smiled weakly thanking her saying that was better.  She gave her meds through her g-tube then fed her &amp; Deb took the full feeding (FOUR ounces of Ensure).  She then sat with her eyes closed.  We asked her if she was okay and she said ""I tired.""  She was going back to sleep again.  I left by 6:30PM and she was drifting off.  THAT was her day.  She has gone down quite a bit in the last month - from being mobile and able to walk - to wheelchair bound.  From roaming the building for a while to not having the strength to stay awake.  She's scheduled to get her blood drawn first thing in the morning.  As deeply as she sleeps she'll probably sleep through that.  The hospice nurse practitioner will be there @ 12:30PM.  Hopefully al the tests will be back by then.  To see her in this condition and how far she has slid in the last month it's just beyond comprehension that she can keep going another month.  And yet Medicaid says ""No infection - No hospice.""  Praying beyond belief tonight that between the chest x-ray and the bloodwork SOMETHING is bad enough to keep her on it.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147521047,,,AlzConnected,,,

The chest x-ray came back clear of pneumonia no enlarged heart &amp; no fluid around lungs - yet.  Evidently congestive heart failure goes in bounds.  They cleared the fluid with the Lasix she had in July that gave her a life threatening seizure so no more Lasix however it did the trick then &amp; the fluid hasn't returned yet.  They did a blood work up and it came back ""okay"" or nothing significant enough to keep her on hospice.  So Deb's last day on hospice will be Thursday October 8.  When I asked hospice what is giving her so much chest pain the only answer they could give me was ""Possibly her thoracic arthritis.  We don't know.""  They further said the reason she's going off is Medicaid.  According to hospice Medicaid has become very strict with long-term hospice patients.  Deb is on for the second time and has been now for 14 months.  So I am totally brought down by this.  The first thing I thought of was her wheelchair.  Hospice got it for her.  I found out they rent it.  To keep it I had to get the rental changed from hospice to me because the SNF wouldn't pick up the monthly cost.  Of course the SNF has wheelchairs - just none small enough for Deb.  Hers is a pediatric wheelchair.  I got that done late this afternoon so she wouldn't lose it.  Next tomorrow I'm going to work with the SNF to have their shower aide work with the hospice aide on Monday &amp; Thursday to transition her back to the SNF's shower aide.  I don't know how that will go this time.  I'm SO afraid she won't want their shower aide showering her.  She'll keep looking for ""Regina.""  I also have to find some way to explain all this to her tomorrow.  God help me.  I don't know how to tell her that all these people she's come to love are pulling out on her AGAIN.  After that's all done the next thing will be to get with her doctor and make sure he figures something out with this chest pain and gets it better controlled.  Thank you to whoever posted that possibly this is a dry eye condition she is suffering from.  I have dry eye syndrome myself from my Rheumatoid and yet that thought never crossed my mind for Deb.  I'll get that looked into right away.  I feel lost right now.  Lost beaten down &amp; defeated.  I NEVER dreamed she'd go off hospice a second time.  They said they'll contact me around the first of November when their Palliative Program starts because she will qualify for that with flying colors.  I'll have to learn more about it and make that decision later.  Right now I'm not sure I want to do that to her.  I'm SO afraid of hospital stays needles tests etc. for her.  All the things that scare her and she absolutely hates.  I guess as her POA though I have the right to turn a lot of that down.  She's going down now for God's sake.  She's had ENOUGH.  I appreciate so much your support and prayers.  We're really going to need them now.  She's just so tired.  I just can't understand how this could happen; and even though so many of you have said I have not failed her I feel I have.  I'M the one who signed those papers a second time.  No one else.  It was me.  And I knew how hard it was for her going off the first time.  Now they're doing it to her again when they told me when I signed the papers the second time ""Oh that won't happen this time.  She's going on as End Stage Down Syndrome.""  I don't know if that was a sales tactic or what.  I bought into it though.  Many blessings to all of you out there who go through all of this on a daily basis.

We were 90 miles from home when we got the call. We went straight to the nursing home and she was asleep. We went home unpacked and went to bed. At 2 am we get a call that they are sending her to the ER because she had a fever of 102.8 and O2 of 85%.  So we head to the ER and she is admitted with a UTI.  We have spent the past three days at the hospital with her. Now she has a bad cough and I'm hoping she is not developing pneumonia. I feel bad for two reasons. First I should not have gone anywhere with her in the final stages but my head says that it wouldn't have made a difference. Then while I was in the ER with her I prayed that God would stop her suffering. I can't stand to watch her in pain. Then they start asking about a DNR and what I want them to do to save her. When they get to the question of tube feeding I said yes because I don't want her to starve to death and my mom clear as day says ""No. No tubes.""  Was she there with us for that short period of time. I had to make the decision and I went with what she said. I said ""No"". Did I make the right decision?  Oh my God this is hard. I hate these decisions. I hate this disease. I want to know that I'm doing what she wants. None of us should have to make these decisions. I'm so ready for this to be over but that means losing her.

I just needed a place to say that I'm still really sad that Mom has Alzheimers and I have a lot of mixed feelings because we moved her into Memory care in June.    Mom was drinking too much. I had been watering it down and metering it out - but due to the fight with her my brother and then the lawyer saying (as prompted by my brother) that legally she could drink as much as she wanted...it was still in the house...   I knew my brother would not consent to sending Mom to rehab as the social worker suggested - after that meeting and me telling him I was worried that it was really unsafe for Mom to drink so much  he went out and bought Mom and electric wine bottle opener and continued to bully me verbally.     As I feared Mom fell in the house and broke her hip.  Thankfully I heard the fall and was there in seconds.  I called the paramedics as I felt something was wrong...she sent them away.  When the 2-3 glasses of wine wore off she started feeling the pain and so I called the paramedics again and she let them take her to the hospital.     She had hip replacement surgery - and a sedated detox (a blessing in disguise probably).  However she became highly agitated delerious - was hallucinating constantly.  The rehabilitation hospital that assured me that they handle dementia patients - I mean I was TOTALLY upfront about her detox Alzheimer's and vascular dementia - after she was admitted said they couldn't handle her and required us to have and pay for a caregiver at the hospital 24/7 while she was there.   PLEASE BE AWARE THIS HAPPENS A LOT I'VE BEEN TOLD.    Had I been thinking more clearly I wouldn't have trusted the doctors social worker (at the hospital) and the rehab hospital (although I am not sure how I could have known that then).  Mom should have gone to a memory care facility as soon as possible and had nursing/medical care there - the doctor/social worker/rehab therapist had recommended 'skilled nursing'.     Anyway once she was physically stabilized we moved her into memory care near my brother.  I was so tired of fighting with him and Mom considering him the ""Golden Boy"" that right before she broke her hip I decided it was time to let my brother bear the brunt of this and for me to get my life back.   I have to give credit to the caregiver's support group and the Eldercare lawyer I consulted who helped me stipulate Mom was to go to Memory Care only - safeguarding her firstly and secondly safeguarding the money to be able to pay for her care.       Mom contined to be delerious and didn't know who I was for much of the time.  The second to last time I visited her she was angry with me for  ""staging my own death and making her think I  (her daughter) was dead for 8 months"" -- I had actually seen her two weeks before that visit.   Being ousted from Mom's house and thoroughly exhausted/sad/feeling devasted..... I decided to take my best friend up on her offer to move in with her...across the country in California.  We had talked about living together ...but in the distant future.  Having lost my Dad a year ago and caring for Mom for 10 months until she broke her hip..I wanted to be near my friend of 30 years- who knew my parents when I was growing up.  I worked out that I could train and become a teacher within a year - a new career that would give me some financial security and basically start a new chapter in a beautiful state - FAR FAR away from my brother (who has  continued to be a bully - but I am now as extricated as possible from him and the situation).     Mom has stabilized over the last 5 months - but it has taken that time for her to become much less agitated and not delerious most of the time. My brother visits her regulary and I keep in touch with the manager of the memory care and her doctor.       I feel relief...then some guilt over feeling relieved then sad griefstriken and guilty again.  I feel hopeful about my future and sad over not having any immediate family anymore.  I was missing Mom a lot this week and feeling very sad for her ...that this disease happened to her.  I began to fantacize about going back to Texas getting an apartment and moving her in with me and having caregivers in much of the time.  Then I think well that just wouldn't work...and my brother would never agree anyway and i need to get on with my life.  And then I feel selfish - that I'm putting myself first and then I REALLY feel selfish when I admit that I don't really want to have Mom live with me and don't think I would do so now even if my brother wasn't standing in the way.   Then I tell myself to not feel guilty...that it's okay to move on Mom is in a really good facility and my brother is visiting her and I was there and kept Mom in her house as long as was possible - there when she really needed me to be.  Then I feel guilty for not feeling guilty....        Does this cycle ever end??!!      I am trying to not be so crazy...but it was hard this week!     I really do miss Mom especially being able to hug her hold her hand stroke her hair and cheeks.  I find it so painful to know that she forgets that we just spoke right after I call her....it makes me feel it is pointless to speak with her and then I fall into a pit of sadness after I speak with her too.  I send cards but I know that she cannot really see cards well anymore either...and forgets they are there.  I guess this is just part of loving someone with dementia and the consequences of me having decided to move away.         I truly value the 10 months I lived with her - I am grateful for that time and the memories even though it was extremely difficult as well.  I got to see my father a whole month before he died and to help my mother in the early stages of grief - to help her stay in their home which was best for her.  I got to know more about Mom and have some special memories with her...and I got to begin to say goodbye to her.  And I also got to move back home to America which I wanted to do... not due to this terrible crisis of course...but I've survived what I never would have believed I could survived this past year.   And I am back in the land I love with my best friend working through grief doing the best I can and trying to do what I can to build a future for myself.

I'm new here but have been caring for my mother for years already. She always was a fighter and verbal abuser when she did not get her way now it has magnified ten fold. It feels almost like amplifying the worse and loosing the best of her. I Feel like my last memories of her will be only the worse and have forgotten any of the good.    She does not have the strength but she hits me more than when I was a child when she abused Rx and alcohol to treat pain. Restraining her just makes her fight harder and with her tiny bones afraid she will break a bone. She refused to use the shoe or boot when she broke bones in her foot. She wants to control her own meds but will take too many. She does not want me in the doctors room with her but they speak to me afterward. She how ever feels she has a right to go to my doctors and even invade my privacy in the bathroom. I have to knock on her door and she just walks in and wakes me for what ever is on her mind at any time of the night.   I understand the sundown effect but he is like a bi-polar I never now what she will do or say next.    Over the last few years I have lost three doctors GPs because her calls and fights with the staff to get information on me and my appointments. Then I have to start with a whole new set of specialists to go with the new GP.   I don't want to take legal action to take her freedom away but my brother and I are considering it. She charges on her cards and never pays more than the minimum but it effect our credit not that she understands. I pay a bill and she thinks I am stealing from her while she cleared my savings out for spite and then lost all the money several thousand some place. My brother and I are trying to clear her cards before taking them away from. Unfortunately the more we restrict and confine her the more she hates............. That she does not forget but hangs onto it like a life line in the middle of an ocean. Of all the things not to loose it had to be her hate.    I was hospice caretaker for my in-laws from cancer and a back disability for my husband this is far worse and I have only my brother twice a week to lean on.    As her time winds down we are trying to set her affairs straight but honestly she might have papers and accounts hidden that even my father did not know of when he was alive. Lies and sneaking hording hiding have always bee in her nature now we are trying to untangle her Gordian knot    This really is cruel want to end for everyone.,False,Iris L.,2011-12-15,17760.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147521338,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have two supportive sisters however I was made power of attorney by my parents long before my mother died in 2011 of non-smokers lung cancer. My Dad has had Alzheimer's for many years but was not formally diagnosed until after my mother died when my sister and I took him to a specialist.  After she died it became apparent that he could not live alone. Fortunately my parents saved money for their retirement and my Dad has enough money to care for himself. We tried sitters at first but they could not handle him and were constantly calling me at work. Then we put him in an Alzheimer's assisted living facility.  This was great for a while. We told him it was his ""apartment"" and that he was staying there while his house was being worked on and that it was temporary. Eventually we decided that the facility was not clean enough and was not keeping Dad clean enough and we moved him to another assisted living facility and he stayed there and we were all happy for a few years. Then he started getting pneumonia and after the last bout he could no longer get around without help was having trouble swallowing he needed oxygen was incontinent  and the assisted living facility said they were not allowed to feed him or help him walk. So our only option was a nursing home.  We visited several and did research and finally decided on one. It has turned out to be the best place for him. They have taken excellent care of him he has been clean well fed he has round the clock care including nutritionists and wound care specialists and they keep me updated on every change.   Sounds great right? No you know that. Alzheimer's is never great. Dad can't get over this last bout of pneumonia after 3 rounds of antibiotic. He has lost weight. He has gone from talking in his ""own way"" to barely being able to say a word he's very lethargic seems to be in pain a lot and wants to lay in bed. I was called by his nurse practitioner this weekend and was asked to consider hospice. The reason given was that he had lost weight and wasn't eating well. However when my sister was there this weekend she watched him eat just fine. With his pneumonia he has a harder time eating because he gets choked easy he coughs a lot and I'm sure it's exhausting. I am a realist I know that even without complications Dad may have only a year of life left. Now that he is sick it make matters worse. We have worried that he would choke on phelm in his sleep and die.   I was told that once on hospice  the nurses aides would continue to try to feed him and would still take care of him but he would no longer see the medical professionals. Hospice would provide comfort care and pain medication.  I know in my heart that Dad did not want to suffer in his last days. I need some sort of guidance.

A brief reminder of my situation is that almost three years ago my partner and I moved in with my mom after my father passed away. When we moved in we had several tests done and my mom was diagnosed with dementia.  Currently she is around stage 5 where she can walk communicate and can still do some things for herself with some assistance from me.  Here is the issue that has recently arisen:  Quite a few years ago my mom fell down she apparently hurt her hip but never went to the doctor to actually find out what happened.  This was still when she was being cared for by my father.  As most dementia patients it takes a LOT of doing to get my mom to cooperate to go to a doctor or to simply go out of the house.  I give her some chores to do like putting her dishes away that are in the dishwasher and putting her own laundry away.  Neither of which has been happening in the past two weeks.  My mom has been complaining about being in pain states it's on her side in the hip area and she claims she can't do anything like even walk to the door.  She's been getting up to go to the bathroom but no longer goes into the kitchen to take her ""Vitamins"" but she does go into her fridge to get food out and take it to her bedroom to eat it.  She is not walking to her fridge as often as she used to.  When I ask her what's wrong she claims she is ""Getting better and needs to just rest.""  I am trying to narrow down what's actually going on inside of her body but I don't feel she's being honest and just doesn't want to put her dishes away or doing anything but lay in her bed all day.  She still gets up twice a week with my prompting and helping her to visit with my brother who brings her meals twice a week.  I help her get dressed wash her hair or shower when she lets me help her.  Most times she just refuses to wash and will only get dressed if I help her. My mother is extremely stubborn and refuses to go to the doctor to find out where her pain is coming from.  Even when I do get her to the doctor for her BP check she lies to the DR and tells her she is feeling well so the DR can not diagnose anything or help her.  Am I just supposed to allow my mom to stay in bed allllll day every day and not DO anything at all?  She used to go out and get the newspaper (she fought us every day about stopping the paper but still went and got it) dust around the house on occasion when prompted put the dishes away put dishes in the dishwasher put her laundry away or at least fold it and put it on the side of her bed etc.; none of which is being done.  When I talk to her she seems to have no trouble communicating with me and agrees to do things when I ask her but then does not do it.  For example it's been over a week since the dishes in the dishwasher need to be put away.  I take care of cooking and cleaning I work from home so I know exactly what she does and does not do.  She seems to have some more issues walking and is using a cane now but this could be because she almost never gets out of bed.  I know I can't MAKE her do anything and I never force her to do anything because I know this only makes things worse.  Does anyone have any advice for me as to what I can do to engage her and to get her treatment for her pain?  I don't really know if she is in actual bad pain as my mother never was one to take even an aspirin.  I mean years ago when my mom had a hysterectomy she refused pain meds! Can you imagine?!  So if anyone has any advice about how to handle and care for her I would appreciate it.

She has pretty bad arthritis in a hip but the Dr says she is very functional so he wouldn't move towards surgery for that until it affects her funcionality and he leans towards conservative management of her back issues.  Mom has had chiropractic treatment which brought relief for a little while but pain kept coming back.  Most recently she had a steroid injection.  That helped and she is scheduled for a second injection next week.  Thinking down the road and looking at mom's quality of life...  Keeping the pain at bay is possible at the moment and we are trying everything possible to avoid surgery.  She would rather not undergo surgery at all if possible.  The pain can be pretty intense and I know it makes her feel miserable when she is having a bad day.  Meds don't help at all at this point.    I know this isn't an orthopedic forum    so here's why I am writing about this:  I have seen with other members that their LO has sometimes had a major decline after a hospital stay or surgery.  Mom doesn't want surgery unless there's no other option.  I am looking down the road and trying to think about how to go about things when and if other measures don't help with the pain.  It seems like it comes down to choosing pain relief possibly offered by surgery over preserving her cognitive function - I hate the thought of losing her more quickly to the AD but I hate the thought of her living in pain.  Mom knows she is struggling with memory loss (well... she knows it some of the time) - so I know that she wouldn't want to sacrifice her mind if at all possible  - yet if the pain continues to increase with little chance for relief what do we do then?  I may be the decision maker at that point and I don't want it to take me by surprise.

I would try and update on dad as I found things out as I know my family here were concerned but it's hard to find time to read and reply.  As far as meds and hospice Jo C Stephanie Be Strong and many others (😊) might be better qualified to ask.  I know 20 years ago my mom was taken off meds except for morphine for pain.  I believe when a LO goes on hospice most or all preventative meds are stopped.  The premise is to keep them as comfortable as possible.    No ""treatments"" or preventative meds.  I might not be completely correct in this so I'm hoping someone else will clarify.   I also would like to know if on hospice and with alz are narcotics used.  I think I remember hearing or reading something about that not being a good idea.    When dad reaches the point where he is bedridden not communicating etc. I just don't feel Namenda or any alz meds would be beneficial.

My mother is living in a continuing care facility (CCF) in their ""Special Care Unit"". I live in the same city and am retired. There have been a few occasions when Mother has had to go to the hospital emergency room. On one such occasion I was called by the nurse on duty told what had happened and that they were sending Mother to the hospital ER. I immediately left headed to the hospital but after arriving had difficulty finding a parking place. I ended up having to park a long distance from the ER and because I have spinal stenosis and experience pain when walking it took a long time for me to get to the ER.    When I did arrive I found Mother sitting in a chair in the waiting area unattended and totally confused about where she was or why she was there. Being ambulatory she could have easily gotten up and walked out and no one would have noticed! Is this ""Special Care?     This experience was an eye-opener for me and I remain very concerned by this practice of the CCF. When I complained  at the time and again later I was simply told that they were following policy. No attempt has been made to explain this kind of treatment by a group called the ""Special Care Unit"".     Have any of you experienced this kind of situation and treatment or better yet a different way of handling a similar situation?

I cannot go on like this much longer.  I truly hate the disease that is taking my mother from me and Satan has taken hold of my leg and won't let me go making it even more difficult to handle.  For much of my life I never really knew my mom but in the last 5 years that she has been living with me I've come to learn that I love her more than anything. I am at the point where I can't bear to watch her suffer like this. It is tearing me up inside both physically and mentally.  While she is not in any physical pain this disease is wreaking havoc with her brain.  She is on an emotional roller coaster and is taking me along on its chaotic ride.  I am thankful to still have her but it is destroying me to see her struggle like this.  I'm also still thankful that she can still take direction but the unknown is for how much longer.  I finally accept the fact that I am fast becoming unable to care for her and in spite of how I have felt about her doctors telling me she needs to be in a nursing home I fear they are right. I don't want to be my mother's caregiver any longer as it is just too painful. What I want is to just be her daughter again.  Her quality of life is just about zero. There isn't anything that she can do on her own any more . . . she needs help with everything. She has lost interest in her computer and she's bored with tv.  She spends about 90% of her life sleeping. And when she is awake she's continually asking me why I hate her so much. How can I hate her so much  if I keep taking her home rather than leaving her in the nursing homes I've virtually given up living in my own home to be with her I see that she gets to the doctor I see that she gets dressed that she has her 3 meals a day and her snacks and then sit here listening to her tell me that I don't love her and again why do I hate her so much (and each time it feels like a knife being stabbed into my already hurting heart).  I hear her cry out in her sleep for you to please take her in her sleep. She thinks that you too don't want her. She keeps asking me to help her because she doesn't understand what is happening to her brain and all I can say is that it's slowing down now that she is 95.  Please Heavenly Father I really don't want to put her into a nursing home as I know that she will believe that I don't want her any more and that couldn't be further from the truth. I know it is your decision as to when it's time for us to enter this world and to leave it and I pray that you will soon answer her prayer and allow her to pass as she lay in my arms and not alone in a nursing home.  I'm sure you're aware that I have not been the best Catholic but I am sure I don't fall into the classification of being the worst either. I beg on bended knees that you please answer her prayer and take her back home to those of her family who have already left this earth.

I think my mom is having an inflammatory process in her brain not serious like hydrocephalus or anything but enough to to cause many of her symptoms. As a background mom was living alone with mild to moderate dementia through Feb when suddenly  literally overnight she became riddled with pain in hips and shoulders and went from being able to walk miles every day to not being able to get out of bed.  Due to the dementia she refused to go to an MD until ultimately she had to be removed by paramedics.  In the hospital they gave her one dose of prednisone and she was suddenly up and walking around and even more furious but still not mentally stable.  She has since been on Depakote for moods and prednisone for what was diagnosed as acute polycystic rheumatica which attacks the shoulders and hips. 20 mg of prednisone is not safe for long term use.  Without the prednisone within days her joints lock up. But here is the interesting part when they reduced her prednisone to 10 mg her cognitive function also declined. She was having mild word finding difficulties before but now at times she can barely put a sentence together! SO...what other anti inflammatory meds may help?  My mom is doctor phobic but she will have to go to an MD when we change facilities in a few weeks so I want to be able to get as much done as possible.  Ie ) she has bad toenail fungus...I wonder if she has a mild bacterial infection that is causing swelling?? So many unknowns with this disease. But she is not following a typical pattern if there is such a thing  which makes me wonder even more if we are missing something  I hate to think of us having her in a locked unit where if we had JUST found the right treatment she may have had a few more years of freedom.  I am interested in any and all wacky ideas here...kinda like a House Episode  . I am not in denial I know my mom has impairments.  But both my brother and I feel like we are missing something it is a gut thing.  She actually has no formal diagnosis- the hospital treated her like a psych patient more so than a dementia patients...and they sent us home with someone else's paperwork if that helps give any indication of the quality of care received.  We are in FL!! Elderly capital of the country and can't find good docs for this. We want to make our next visit count because who knows how long it will be before she goes again! Sorry for rambling.  Am I crazy to think that we are missing something? Does vascular dementia improve with prednisone??   Oh my my brain never stops!!

She has not eaten or drank for 7 days now.  While I believe with all of my heart of hearts that she is comfortable (thank goodness for hospice) this waiting is just so agonizing.   I have said everything I have felt I need to say and tell her how much I love her and thank her for giving me life and helping to make me the caring and compassionate adult I've become.  I found some letters to her from her mother that I read to her this morning.  In one of them my grandma was recalling all of their happy times together in Yosemite and other national parks.  Grandma said she was planning her next trip to a beautiful spot and hopes my mom is too.  I started crying when I read this to her as I want nothing more than for her to go to a beautiful place and be with her mother again.

On Thursday when they checked her she has gained 2 pounds in the last week.  That is with missing feedings due to residual and refusal.  The hospice aide and nurse think it is fluid accumulating from the CHF in her calves.  She is so tired weak and extremely pale.  Her oxygen level though remains high &amp; they did not hear any signs of the crackling in her lungs yet since the Lasix dissipated it last week.  She has been extremely confused.  That one is hard to tell which part of her it's coming from.  With signs of AD diagnosed Parkinson's diagnosed Congestive Heart Failure &amp; the Reglan that helps her absorb causing memory problems she's got more stacked up against her than for her.  Any and all of the above are probably contributing.  She is starting to forget names - but the closest family member so far she has forgotten is a nephew who came to see her recently.  He is almost 16 and has been a part of her life so it appears that ugly forgetfulness of family may be sneaking in now.   It just appears that nasty disease is doing it's thing to her.  At least we made it out of the month of July when most of our family members died - including both parents.  She had that life threatening seizure the day after our mother died 12 years ago.    I am running out of steam myself.  This is just getting harder and harder to watch - and every day I get more tired.  I've gotten through this process by telling myself ""If Deb can keep fighting as hard as she is so can I.""  I think she's got a lot more fight than I do though we see her weakening now daily.  How do you keep yourself going for years like this?  A number of you have done it on this board.  I know I'm not the only one.  She's been in my care for 12 years - most of which has been on a very slow decline - with many hospital stays.  Her hospital stays have ALWAYS been like a child.  I would spend @ 12 hours a day with her at the hospital.  When I was younger and not as eaten up with arthritis I can even remember staying over night with her two nights sleeping on the floor next to her bed.  Yesterday she just wanted to lean her head against me and had such a hard time staying awake.  Thursday afternoon one of the aides asked her if she wanted to go hear music.  There was a lady in the building playing the guitar.  For the first time she said yes but she wanted to take the wheelchair.  That's the FIRST time she's requested the wheelchair.  I keep wondering how much longer this can go on.  A friend of mine who's a counselor told me obviously she's got one more life to touch or she'd have died in that seizure.

Her concern basically was ""Will I have phlegm in heaven?""  She is SO afraid of choking to death and that is a realistic fear for her.  So how do you explain the transition from earth to heaven to a child?  I quickly thought the best way to describe it to her.  I told her ""Guess what Deb?  The day your angels take your hand and say 'Come with me Debbie.  It's time to go' God will make your body totally and completely well.  No Deb.  You won't have any phlegm in heaven.  You won't have your feeding tube in heaven either.""  She looked at me puzzled and asked ""How I eat?""  I told her ""Your throat will be well and you'll be able to swallow without any problems.""

She would never get sick and there would be no more pain.  The last one really touched her.  ""No more pain Pammy?  No more pain?""  I responded ""You know I told you I'd always tell you the truth.""  She nodded.  ""No more pain Deb.  No more pain.""    As only a child could ask she said ""Will I have a birthday party?""

Deb was sitting in her chair had taken off her glasses and rested her head on the pillow on her chair.  She was sound asleep and had a smile on her face.

The last several days she has started sobbing at different times.  She has been unable to express herself verbally for quite sometime.  Yesterday I'm pretty sure she said ""Robert"" (her brother who died several years ago) and a few minutes later she called out ""daddy daddy daddy"" several times.   Her facial expressions show fear and mental pain.  I sit with her hold her hand stroke her face and hair etc. during these moments but it seems to bring her little if any comfort.   Her medications have been adjusted and she is a lot less agitated than she was prior to and at the beginning of hospice.  Several weeks ago I shared many ""gifts"" of lucid moments with her then she was nearly comatose from sedation and now it's this.      It is so painful to watch her discomfort and feel so helpless.  I want nothing more than peace for her while simultaneously knowing that only death will bring her true peace at this point.  It's heartbreaking no matter how I look at it.

And bodysnatching wierdness?,"I hate repeating myself but I can't personally figure out how to find my old posts and as I'm relatively new here most of you probably don't remember me anyway. (If you can let me know how to find them please do!) So some context:  Mom-in-Law was diagnosed around 2012. My hubby raced onto the scene just before the diagnosis when we realized she was in danger. (We'd moved out of state and the original plan was for her to move with us as soon as a house was built.)  He wasn't aware that he needed a lawyer and a petition. (Much more drama including him being accused of attempted kidnapping but I won't go into that here.) So a legal guardian was appointed because it was the only petition before the judge.  Since then this guardian (and I use the term loosely) has done everything to keep hubby apart from his mom.  Thanks to the swift return back to FL necessitated by Momz's emergency we were unemployed for quite some time and struggled to support ourselves and afford a lawyer. We finally got one and thought the case was a slam dunk based on the guardian's numerous contraventions of direct court order amongst other things.  Sadly we got a new judge (the original one who's orders were violated repeatedly had retired) and the guardian still has custody.  However we FINALLY have legal permission for my husband to visit his mom. He last saw her about a year ago in court.  Today as part of the new court ruling where my husband was AGAIN to be informed and consulted the guardian sent a list of the medications Momz is on.  Frightening stuff! Including 2 quite dangerous depression meds - together?? These are supposedly not prescribed for depression but for pain from shingles. Another medication (I can't recall which condition it was for - have to go back and look) actually listed dementia as a potential side effect. What the??  Then the weird body snatching thing. They sent three photos of his mom allegedly ""proving"" how happy she was at the nursing home they're now warehousing her in. (The original court order insisted she be maintained in her original home.)  The first picture looks similar to her though she looks pensive (as opposed to happy) and appears to have aged about 15 years in the past 3. I realize illness can do this but wow are they taking care of her?  The other two photos are not recognizable as his mother at all. The facial features seem very different not only from our memory of her but from the one photo that DOES look like her. I'm aware that some medications do change facial shapes. (Though the most prominent one I'm familiar with is - eek! - Thorazine.) But seriously these two other (smiling) photos aren't clearly identifiable as his mom! Nor does the woman in these other photos dress like or wear jewelry like his mom. (Now I realize folks tastes change but...)  Meanwhile Momz is allegedly being treated for weight loss. The woman in the photo doesn't look like she needs anything to combat weight loss.  As soon as we get a copy of the final order (so that my hubby can't be harassed by the police) he will be visiting to determine her state of health to determine if this woman pictured actually IS his mom and of course just to see and be with her.  But this is nuts. At this point we can't figure out if age and medication has changed her that much or if the legal guardian whether knowingly or by mistake substituted photos of some other woman. And if so either the guardian either doesn't know what Momz looks like - a problem right there - or something even scarier is happening.",False,Lionrhod,2015-04-04,41.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147519832,,,AlzConnected,,,

She gave them a behavior chart to use since they weren't doing that.    I went in and asked about it Thursday and was told there was no chart - only a page of information about different categories of behaviors. The unit director told me there is no place for anyone to write on it and she had no instructions to have the aides write about mom's behaviors. She couldn't even find the document when I asked to see it.     Now I think I've really alienated her because I texted the nurse who said she would call the administrator and ask again to have it filled out. She reaffirmed that while it's not in chart form with boxes to check aides are meant to write on it daily. (She had to contact the administrator because the unit director was off on Friday.)     Any suggestions for dealing with the unit director? She's been very defensive with me and the psych nurse and now I'm sure she's going to feel like I went over her head and complained.      Some good news - h er doctor ordered the blood work and a urine rest! Yay! That's the first time he's ever done something I asked. Having the psych nurse must be the difference. He still wants her to come in - after he gets the test results - so that's a bit of a pain but at least he's willing to consider changes.

I'm a witch/Wiccan and think of death as a natural part of the cycle of life/death/rebirth  I don't peronsally see death as an end but instead as a door to new life.

At the same time I like any normal loving family member I'm not in any hurry for my own death nor the deaths of any of my loved ones.  I'm currently dealing with a sister who is stage 4 cancer and a MIL who  has Alzheimers.  What is right what is wrong? How long should we preserve life and at what cost at pain and suffering?

835,621071597b65de9a5b66c9ba,2147519892,2015-08-10 20:28:00,The part of Alzheimer's no one told me about...,This is my second time posting on this forum and I know it is only one of many future posts and visits to this site. I posted for the first time a few weeks ago and shared my story for the first time ever. I received more support than I ever could have imagined. To anyone who read or responded I want to give a heartfelt thank you.     I am 25 and caring for my 52 year old mom who as early AD and my 17 year old brother. To say I feel overwhelmed is a vast understatement. No one who hasn't gone through it understands the true stress and pain of caring for someone with AD. I'm writing today to just vent my feelings and hopefully get some advice.     I could talk about at least 100 different issues I need advice on or answers to so I honestly don't even know where to start. I guess I'll start with the part of AD I had no clue about...     No one told me about the part where your mom realizes she is changing. The part where she knows she is different than she used to be. The part where she asks you if you think she is doing worse. The part where she asks what life will be like for her down the road. The part where she wonders if she will be here for the big moments in her children's lives. The part where you realize she has the exact same fears as you.      The thing that hurt me the most when she was first diagnosed was wondering how scared she must be.  Maybe it was me being naive or selfish but I never thought or realized the time would come where she would notice the changes too.      She was very emotional today. She spent a lot of the day crying. I don't know how to deal with that situation. I kept asking her what was wrong but she wouldn't tell me.      My best friend has been my rock through this and she came over when I told her my mom was crying and that I didn't know why. She opened up to my friend and told her she was scared of the future and what was going to happen to her.      It absolutely breaks my heart. I don't want my mom to EVER be scared sad or hurting. I know I can't control it but to know that she is in pain devastates me.      I don't know why she opened up to my friend and not me. But I'm glad she opened up to somebody I have tried repeatedly to get her to go to counseling but she refuses. I know it would help her but I don't know how to convince her to go.     I'm normally very strong and I very rarely cry but I broke down today. I know there are good days and bad days. And the bad days will come more often as time passes but I need help dealing with those days. I don't know the right way to talk to her when she is upset. I'm not a super sensitive person and I feel like I am missing the 'nurturing gene.' Which may be why my mom opened up to my friend instead of me.      I knew there would be mood swings happy days mad days and sad days. But I didn't know the reasons for some of those days would be because she feels like she is losing who she used to be.     So I guess I have two issues tonight. I didn't know this part of AD was a part of AD. And I don't know how to be the nurturing sensitive and caring daughter that my mom deserves to have. I know I have A LOT of anger built up. I am seeing a psychiatrist but she is more concerned with my sleep than my moods. According to her I don't have an angry face....?

I would like to impress upon her that I am responsible for her welfare and if she overdoses I will be sent to jail.  I cannot do this without some assistance from at least one of the doctors.  I am thinking of asking the nurse practitioner who sees her at the psychiatrist's office for a letter stating that I am to be in charge of medications.            Is this feasable?

Oliver    Sacks ""Awakenings""   I took care of my husband Tom at home through the duration of his years with    Alzheimer’s. I did it with private home health care respite breaks for short    vacations and what amounted to a great deal of personal determination because I    wasn’t exactly encouraged to take this challenge on. Institutionalizing Tom and    getting on with my life seemed to be the only response I got when I asked for information    and options even though I expressed my desire to keep Tom home as long as possible and    even though I had the ability to do it. While everyone expressed concern with my health    they all seemed to miss the point that Tom and I were going to be the ones living with the    decisions not them. As for Tom once his disease became apparent he ceased to have any    real value outside of our immediate circle. He became a non-person who was nothing but a    burden in the eyes of everyone around him. We quickly learned that once cognitive    functions become affected you are not only avoided you are in a very real sense    despised because your very presence points out how fallible we humans really are. For    some reason keeping Tom home was to invite a psychiatric classification and when I    didn’t roll over and assume the victim stance I was labeled as overtly controlling    unrealistic and finally an extremist. I wondered when ‘commitment’ and     ‘obligation’ became expressions of emotional decay.  Even though I prevailed doesn’t mean I sailed through this experience on     ‘gossamer wings.’ Like everyone else facing this care challenge I was also    plagued with the self doubt anger frustration outright despair and unidentified    feelings of grieving that conspired to defeat us both. No one comes into this experience    prepared for what is ahead and I was no exception. My decision to keep Tom home evolved as    his illness progressed and as I grew in skill and confidence. The day dawned when I    realized I had already been through the worst of it and his care needs actually became    easier as his illness progressed. By the time he was bed-ridden we had a daily routine    that both of us could depend on. That was when I realized our life wasn’t about     ‘drudgery’ it was about ‘unconditional love.’ The rest of it was about    tasks and information options and help and the tasks were only tasks. Surprisingly I    found myself transferring skills I already had raising my children to my husband and what    do we give our children if it isn’t unconditional love? We raise them with    encouragement appreciation limits and care. Do our Alzheimer family members require    less?   I spent a lonely 10 years scrambling around to find solutions to the problems his    illness presented. But in the end I managed to fit the pieces together and like so many    other caregivers I’ve met in my travels I found a new way to appreciate life. The    turnabout happened when I determined I wasn’t a victim overtly controlling    unrealistic or extreme. I rejected all those labels because they were offered by people    who resided at too safe of a distance from our particular reality. Instead I took charge    of our lives. It wasn’t until then that I could even envision the sanctity of the    role I had taken on or see Tom’s needs in terms of a disease process and not as an    extension of who he was as a human being. I am by nature a stubborn person but I was also    lucky in that I had Tom. He was never a defeatist; he was someone who took what life    handed him and ran with it. I remember jogging with him up Madison Avenue in New York    City just after the book ""Do What You Like and the Money Will Follow"" was    released. Tom stopped by a book store window and responding to the title he turned to me    and said:   ""You know being successful in life isn’t about doing what you like at all.    Being successful in life has to do with learning to like what you have to do.""   Those words became a life lesson for me which brings me back to the point of this    article.    How do you find a sense of contentment and peace and love in the face of the horror this        disease perpetrates on people on entire family units?  How do you feel any relationship to someone who can’t communicate their needs        their wants or their relationship to you?   How do you develop any pride in accomplishing the tasks involved in this care experience        when the world around you thinks you are crazy for taking on this challenge in the first        place? After all ""They don’t even know who you are!""  How do you face this care challenge with someone you might never have had a close        abiding relationship with in the first place?     The answer to that is this: You simply choose to do so.   Another Way to Die   This disease is not the result of some devastation hurled at us by an uncaring God. It    is in reality nothing more than another way to die. It isn’t a better or worse    death than any other. It is what it is a disease process which has nothing to do with the    inherent essence of who we are as people if we are unfortunate enough to get it. The fact    that this disease robs us of the ability to communicate our needs doesn’t make those    needs any less needful. The soul doesn’t get Alzheimer’s any more than it gets    Cancer. The great reality of life is that we are all going to die someday and although    the vast majority of us would choose to die in our sleep without pain with our family    relationships intact our cognitive functions in order and able to wipe our own bottoms    the fact is few of us will have that sort of death.   Most of us will need to be nurtured the way our children need nurturing and I for one    hope and pray that I won’t be made to feel I’m a useless burden to those who    care for me. To feel helpless and unloved has to be a fate worse than death and if you    think ""Our People"" [loved ones with Alzheimer’s Disease] are unable to feel    those things because they can’t communicate you are so mistaken. Those of us who do    the hand’s-on day-to-day care know they respond to love in it’s most    unconditional sense the same way a small child responds to the unconditional love    it’s parent gives. That response is first developed when a child is born and it is    the last thing the Alzheimer’s brain loses when the person dies.   We look to find an inherent satisfaction in our child rearing with an expectation of    accomplishment and joy in the process and it follows that we tend to find these    attributes because of that expectation. There was a time in history when we also expected    to find a sense of accomplishment and if not joy certainly peace or contentment in    tending to our elderly and our dying. The ‘Ritual of Death’ was as important to    human development as was the ‘Ritual of Birth’ and it was important for valid    reasons. Life moves in a circle from birth to death and the circle has been sacred to    indigenous peoples since the onset of time. The beginning segment of a life span was not    to be revered and the ending segment reviled. Both were an essential part of the    spiritual emotional and physical growth of all people.   That has changed. Death has become abhorrent and perhaps we are sorrier as a people for    that change. The irony is that avoiding the care of the dying has also deprived us of a    very necessary part of our spiritual and emotional growth and perhaps the caregiving    experience is the missing ingredient to our becoming more a part of our world. To be    there to help someone through the last vestiges of life has to be the greatest gift we    give next to giving birth. Instead we live in a world that worships the quick fix and we    have trouble understanding that we can’t experience the ‘highs’ in life if    we don’t also live through the ‘lows.’   I once heard a Native American man speak about our place in the lives of our elderly.    He began by offering…   ""…that all of us if we go back to the ancients came from tribal people. As    tribal people we were taught that rituals were good they gave us structure and meaning    in life and purpose and they kept us in a place of regard and oneness with each    other.""   He went on to describe a young man in his tribe who decided to stop by the house of an    elder woman known to his family and someone he had lost contact with over the years as he    grew. While there he noticed that she was alone with no help. A few days later he dropped    in again. Over time he found himself restructuring his life so that he could make his    regular visits to her often making repairs bringing groceries and in general looking out    for her. These visits became a ‘ritual’ both of them looked forward to a     ‘ritual’ that enriched them both. Then tying this parable to our lives he said:       "" Now when you have to spend Saturday helping Mom buy groceries because she can no    longer drive herself perhaps you can learn to see that task as a ‘ritual’ as a    beneficent gift given out of love and regard instead of a task that takes time out of your    very busy lives. In that way you find a positive way through the changes that confront    you.""   His words had a familiar ring to them and then I recalled Tom’s words "" to    learn to like what you do in life."" I made a concerted effort to see the tasks    involved in his care as a creative exercise and a problem to be solved instead of the    drudgery I was told to expect. Even diaper-changing-time became a ‘ritual’ a    chance to do the best diaper change anyone could do the quickest the most efficient and    the least traumatic for my Tom. Even in that I was able to find a sense of accomplishment.    I realized something very important during my tenure as Tom’s wife and caregiver:   ""The tasks had to be done and I had a choice: I could do them happy or I could do    them mad. Either way they still had to be done.""     Allowing Joy to Happen   ‘Happy’ fortunately won out. Approaching Tom’s care from a place of love    instead of regret made all the difference. Regret only reinforced my feeling like a    victim which was then too easily transferred to Tom. Love on the other hand elevated us    both. It was the choice I had to make and it’s the same choice you face. Finding the    joy in caregiving has to do with setting new priorities learning to value little steps    letting go of old ideals and expectations and accepting life as it unfolds. Even in some    of our darkest moments joy surfaced because I allowed it to happen. And it happened on    what can only be described as profound levels.    That is how you find a sense of contentment and peace and love in the face of the horror        this disease perpetrates.  That is how you develop pride in accomplishing the tasks involved even though the world        around you thinks you are crazy for taking on this challenge.  That is how you know it doesn’t matter if they ‘know who you are’         because you still know who they are.  That is how you wipe the slate clean and begin a new relationship with your loved one        one that evolves out of love and acceptance instead of a life-time of disappointment and        missed connections. There are amazing stories about caregivers and how they found a        connection with their person they never thought possible.    I will be forever changed by the experience. My fear of death is lessened I have no    regrets about my life with Tom and I am stronger and more content than I have ever been    in my life. Tom died without pain in his own bed surrounded by the people who cared for    him with his favorite music playing. If he knew nothing else when he died he knew he was    loved. As I look back on it we should all be so lucky. He had as peaceful a death and as    good a death as one can hope for and in that I was successful. That was also part of the    joy!

Unbelievable!!!,"Well as Deb sat in her chair with her eyes closed on Thursday she told my husband ""I'm going to the bowling alley tomorrow to see my friends.""  He just laughed and said ""Okay Deb!  If you think so!""  In case you hadn't seen my last post she had only taken 2 ozs of Ensure (with water) at noon Thursday no Ensure at 3pm and 2 ozs at 6pm.  I since learned she skipped her 9pm feeding too.  She also had one day completely in the wheelchair because her legs were too shaky to hold her and then two days when she was in it at least 1/2 the day.    So Friday comes.  Her charge nurse comes in to give her a tube feeding at 9am.  She tells the charge nurse ""I better get up.  I'm going bowling.""  Deb was very pale and tired and the charge nurse told her it was too early for her - to go back to sleep for a while and she'd wake her later.  The nurse came back in to do a feeding at noon.  After Thursday barely taking her feedings on Friday she's taking full 4 oz feedings.  The nurse told her ""Deb if you want to try to go to the bowling alley it's time to get up.""  Well with a whole lot of effort she got herself up they got her cleaned up &amp; dressed and the lady I have who takes her on Friday to see her friends from the RCF where she used to live came to pick her up.  I had forewarned her though that Deb had days she couldn't walk this week.  She always takes Deb out with her pediatric wheelchair.  Deb MADE it to the bowling alley; and with the help of the lady who took her actually bowled a couple of frames &amp; got a spare!  She is UNBELIEVABLE.  The lady took a picture of a certain DS young man who appears to be smitten with Deb and he was kissing her cheek after she got the spare (she got it with great help from this woman - but nonetheless got the spare).  By the time I got to her on Friday she's at the door waiting for me.  All she says is ""I went bowling today Pammy!"" - as she grinned at me.  She was as pale as could be &amp; her eyes were black &amp; sunk in her head but by God!  She MADE it to the bowling alley.  I got her to her room and held her around the middle to set her in her chair - as she shook.  As soon as I put her in her chair off comes the glasses head is on the pillow and she's out for a nap.  That did her in.  I stayed &amp; laid on the bed next to her.  She awoke a while later &amp; we played songs on my IPad.  She was SO happy that I would play Silent Night for her.  It's her favorite song.  We sang Silent Night three times and she was ready to go to sleep.  Her charge nurse came in to feed her at 6pm before I was leaving.  I watched to see what she'd do.  She only took 1/2 the feeding &amp; then put her head back down smiling.  She had accomplished what she set out to do.  Somehow she took all the strength she could find and made it to that bowling alley for fun and hugs from her friends - and even a kiss on the cheek from a certain young man.  Now her regular charge nurse was off this weekend and the fill-in nurse was on duty.  I filled her in yesterday on how things had been this week with her being too shaky to walk at times having to use the wheelchair &amp; taking less nutrition.  Well I still got a call today from the same fill-in nurse of how worried she was.  Deb could not stand up for anything.  He legs shook so bad they were giving out so they put her in her little wheelchair &amp; wheeled her to the Dining Room where she could look out the big glass window for our brother who was coming to see her.  The nurse said she kept taking Deb's vitals all day and they stayed fairly stable - low - but stable but it had scared the nurse.  I told her not to worry about it - as long as she wasn't in any pain or discomfort.  The nurse felt certain she was not.  When our brother got there he found her fast asleep in the wheelchair by the window.  And so goes another day in the life of Deb.  Her mind is slipping more too as we go.  She's forgetting more and more and repeating herself more.  But she looks peaceful comfortable &amp; happy.  What more can I ask for as she prepares to leave this world.  She won't live long on 2 oz feedings of Ensure but whatever she can do she will.  A close friend of mine told me Friday after we heard she had made it to the bowling alley (in the wheelchair) ""God is probably looking down saying 'Okay already!  I've sent a whole flock of angels to come get you and you STILL resist.  Do I have to come down there myself to get you???'""  Made me smile.

Like everyone with dementia she doesn't follow a predictable path. Recently she has had a rather steep decline her voice is very quiet and most of her words don't make sense. She has lost 20 pounds since March. The thing that stands out to me is she is falling frequently usually in the middle of a perfectly clear path. (We have ruled out UTI pneumonia pain etc. and keep her floor clear. At the risk of sounding impatient we have done all the obvious including checking shoe fit lighting areas and having her supervised. One time she fell standing right next to me. I am pretty good at knowing the prevention of falls and causes.) I remember hearing that frequent falls signal the beginning of the final stage. Has anyone else heard this? Its just that like everyone else I am trying to anticipate what is next in this tortuous journey.

The eye doctor did in fact recommend single vision which in turn allowed me to get glasses much quicker so I'm hoping better for mom all around.  Due to severe arthritis etc. and aging my mom's feet are very curled.  She was in pain walking due to severe callouses so after treating doctor recommended orthotics.  My goal was to keep mom moving around so I went forward.  Mom; however won't use orthotics.  In slides she likes orthotics make her heel slide around and there is not enough room at the top due to curling in the toes.  I think part of this too is change is very difficult.  I think regular tie shoes (my mom has a couple pair) are out because the slippers are just so much more comfortable.  Any ideas?  It's a balance between getting her feet comfortable which would likely take removing all old shoes and causing great anxiety or letting her go on with very painful callouses.

In the last 10 days she's been diagnosed with congestive heart failure - with fluid around both lungs - put on Lasix to treat it - had a life threatening seizure because of the Lasix - stopped the Lasix - had a repeat chest x-ray - and found the Lasix cleared the fluid ""for now.""    I don't understand all the concepts behind Congestive Heart Failure but am learning largely due to a close friend who is a respiratory therapist.  I called the admin nurse at hospice the other day after the chest x-ray came back to try to wrap my head around all this.  The information I got from the hospice admin nurse more or less was this:  ""Well it certainly does help her cause that she had all this happen but she has to qualify again at the first of August and I don't know that she will.  She needs to have a weight loss and problems absorbing nutrition.  We have to prove to Medicare that we believe she'll die in the next 6 months.""  I was SO upset.  What???!!!!  She now has - on top of everything else - incurable Congestive Heart Failure can't take the medicine to treat it and I've been told by some professionals that the fluid will come back ""sooner than later"" and that she'll drown in it.  Her hospice diagnosis code is ""End Stage Down Syndrome.""  Isn't your heart giving out end stage on its own????  She has SO many things wrong with her &amp; the symptoms overlap the illnesses:  Dementia &amp; worsening when she wakes up (I heard that Dementia should be caused by the Congestive Heart Failure) coughing a lot g-tube for 8 years her limbs are cold most of the time she sleeps more than she's awake (but not considered bed bound because she gets up dressed &amp; then sleeps in her chair or the Dining Room most days) chest pain excessive sweating and the list goes on and on.  But they weighed her the other day and she is actually up 2.6 pounds from her last qualification period.  And unfortunately that weighing was done right after the Lasix which should have meant lost weight due to fluid removal and it didn't.  Taking her off hospice would not only be ludicrous at this point but would probably kill because she's so attached  to their staff.  I was frustrated with the admin nurse.  So a couple of hours later I get a call from hospice's bereavement counselor because ""the nurses seem to think I could use some pre-bereavement counseling dealing with Debbie's impending death.""  Are you kidding me????!!!  I accepted her impending death - as well as anyone can - a long time ago.  It's this yo yoing of illnesses people tell me she can't recover from things and does and now telling me she may not be hospice qualified I have a hard time dealing with.  Right after she was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure her charge nurse at the SNF told me ""This is her golden ticket to hospice.""  Then for the next few days every day when I walked into the SNF different employees including the administrator walked up to me hugged me and ALL with tears in their eyes said ""I'm so so sorry about this latest development.  We love little Debbie and will miss her so much"" - saying this daily to me.  I felt then like she had died &amp; the grief process was setting in.  Now it seems as if hospice is telling me well she has it  but it's cleared up for now so she won't qualify.  We just need to wait about another 10 days to see what happens.  This is just a nightmare.  I can't imagine her going off.  When I signed hospice papers last year for the SECOND time I told hospice I wouldn't sign the papers unless they assured me that she wouldn't go off again.  The nurse said ""Oh no.  That won't happen.  With a diagnosis code of End Stage Down Syndrome she won't come off.""  Now they're saying it's possible she will.  On top of dealing with all this in the last week my own body is struggling.  I've had a Rheumatoid flare sinus infection and now a uti on top of everything else.  I am on antibiotics for the second time in two weeks and totally wiped out myself.  Anybody out there who can help me wrap my head around all that's happening???

As far as we know medically she was recovering well from the small bowel resection surgery. She was making good progress with her strength and mobility despite her resistance to therapy. For whatever reason even after returning to her apartment at AL and her beloved cats she just never regained her appetite and interest in eating and despite my efforts to find ways to help she eventually refused all food and medications. My mother passed away last Friday two months after initially experiencing stomach pain. I fully attribute her passing to the demon  curse  of dementia making her unable to fully recognize her return to the home she had just recently/finally become adjusted to her role in caring for her cats the need for and interest in eating even the most familiar foods the need or desire to participate in her own recovery and care.    My father who has been on hospice since December for lung cancer and who I thought we would have lost before now also has dementia and very little short term memory.  He lives in the same AL but moved a few weeks before my mother's illness began into an apartment in the memory care wing.  We kept him informed of my mom's basic situation along the way although each time it was basically new to him.  After my mom's return to the AL she was taken down to see him a few times by wheelchair. A few days before she passed we told my dad she was dying and brought him up to see her to give him a final chance to say goodbye and that he loved her. Even sitting with her and seeing how she was I don't think he remembered what we had told him or quite realized the situation. The day she passed I went to his room and told him. I could tell he was struggling with the surprise of the news and the inability to put it into context. I had to remind him she had been sick and that he had just seen her. His sorrow and confusion broke my heart. When I left him all I could hope was that he would quickly forget.  And we have received possibly the only  blessing  of dementia - it seems he has forgotten. The next day it was clear he didn't remember the fact of her death but retained the feeling that something was wrong asking where she was (for which I tried my best to answer with a loving fiblet). When I visited him last night he didn't ask about her at all. While I wish we could share in our grief I'm grateful that he doesn't have to continue to suffer with the loss of his beloved wife on top of everything else.,False,LaurieG,2014-02-05,122.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147516483,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have a feeling that mom's nursing home doesn't have a specific written care plan for her though I haven't asked yet. Just a hunch.  We do have quarterly care meetings and I initial a sheet saying I was there.  I'm in touch frequently with them about her care though I'm almost always the one initiating the contact because I'm there so frequently.  Should I request a copy and if they don't have one then what? Read on...I'm trying to resolve some very angry feelings I have right now with them for changing mom's transfer status to Hoyer LIFT and not calling to give me any heads up mostly because I see mom still able to stand!  Granted it's not perfect and she was on two aide status and at there have been times when she could barely lift herself but the majority of the time when I visit late afternoon she can stand at the bar with a little help sometimes just one aide!!. I feel this decision was premature but because of her fluctuations I believe they made this decision to be on the safe side and to protect her immediate caregivers backs. Fine ok I get that.  However this is a major change in her status which could result in losing strength or decompensating? a change in how she is toileted etc.  Big big change and to think that it wouldn't occur to them to give a heads up is infuriating to me!  Yes  mostly they do a good job and dot their i's cross their t's but families are not part of their equation.  Perhaps they were thinking of telling me about it at the next care mtg( 10 days after the chg in status- will be this Wed.)  I still consider that unacceptable.      So now my back is up and I'm finding everything wrong right now( You now how that goes I'm sure) She was served the WRONG meal a few times recently. Serious stuff when you are supposed to be mechanical soft and full pieces of shrimp arrive on your plant or mandarin oranges and unchopped fruit shows up on your plate. Thank goodness I was there and not someone else who might have fed it to her by mistake!!.( I left a msg for the dietician a few days later but not sure he's the right person. (It happened last night to another resident at the table next to mom and the dining room mgr had a fit- not sure who is responsible.)  No pull cord on the new call bell system in mom's room or I've been told it should be coming. A TV remote that has disappeared twice asked for a new one on Thursday and it's still not there. A chair( facility owned) in mom's room that disappeared during her last two hospitalizations and I had to track it down. (I put her name on it now. Probably no written care plan either.  Oh and the time mom's wheelchair cushion ( had been soiled I think) was left in the shower room and she sat for two days on the thin wheelchair base with just a towel I think and no one noticed. ( Mom wears a pain patch on her lower back. ) Fortunately she didn't seem to be in any pain. I told the nurse I thought it might be in the shower room and there it was. Still slightly odoroous so I washed the cover. Or the time I noticed mom's eye was really really red and no one noticed after 3 days! HELLO?  I had to point it out to finally get it treated.  There's more but I will stop here.      I'm trying to get all of this frustration out of my system now so I can be my cool charming self at the mtg! ( Yes I am pretty good this when I'm not pissed off) However I am so completely upset and angry and yes sad to see mom declining that I don't think I can  have a functional conversation.  I also know I need to pick my battles. Do I fuss over a non existent care plan or let it go and try to focus on how we can work together to preserve mom's strength and dignitity during toileting? Mom still asks to go the bathroom. What now? One aide yesterday said they could use a bedpan on her bed. By the way I seriously doubt they would change her status back to 2 person transfer. I walked the hallway yesterday and covered about 80% of the 66 residents and saw only 2 residents on two person transfers. The rest are lifts or 1 person transfers. A fair number of lifts.  Do you think they might consider a lift on an AS NEEDED basis? If she's ill or groggy at that time?  Or provide restorative therapy to make up for the lack of standing? Or can I live in a fantasy that perhaps they would reconsider?   Anyway right now I'm just observing what happens during transfers until the mtg. Not sure what I'm going to say or do at that darn mtg yet. Oh year and the DON retired I went in to talk about the lift and it was her last day.

However on the last visit with mom the doctor advised mom's caregiver to begin giving her morphine for pain. Mom is capable of communicating if she has pain by either furrowing her brow or saying ""mmmm"". This happens when her caregiver needs to change the soft cotton she places between the fingers of her contracted hand. Mom doesn't show any pain when she is otherwise moved turned changed or given a ""bed bath"".    Mom has been with this caregiver for 7 1/2 years and she is with mom 24/7 and very experienced and has given meds from the comfort care kit to her residents when they are needed. (she is licensed for and has three residents in her care home).  Mom's caregiver doesn't want to give mom the morphine yet because she believes the liquid tylenol is taking care of any pain other than the one time per day with the contracted hand. She says she is afraid mom will stop eating if given the morphine. Mom is hungry when she wakes up in the morning and still eats breakfast though little else during the day. Her caregiver  also says she will know when mom needs the morphine and other meds in the kit and will have no problem giving them to her then. She just says it is not needed yet. I agree with her and need to find an acceptable way to tell the Hospice nurse this.     I totally trust her instincts and her caregiving abilities. She has provided excellent almost one-to-one care for these 7 1/2 years and the Hospice Doctor has seen mom only three times in ten months.",False,Because she's my mom!,2011-12-15,737.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147516157,,,AlzConnected,,,

Those who have a loved one with Alzheimer's may ask themselves ""If there is a God why would he/she allow my loved one to develop Alzheimer's in the first place? We don't deserve this. Life is so cruel and unfair.""  How many of us have heard Alzheimer's caregivers say something like the statement above? How many of us have said this ourselves or at least thought it? The age-old question ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" is certainly relevant to our present topic.  Trying to answer such a question is beyond the scope of this article. Furthermore we don't presume to be qualified to do justice to that discussion but we do know from experience that resentment in general and against God in particular can poison one's journey of caregiving. As Malachy McCourt once said ""Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.""  Facing the Herculean challenges of caregiving requires all the strength you can muster including spiritual strength. It has been our experience that caregivers who develop what we would call ""spiritual intentionality"" are better able to face these challenges and retain their joy and hope than those who seek to go it alone fueled by denial anger and resentment.  It is our belief that such resentment and anger is more often than not directed at God whether or not this is recognized and acknowledged. This attitude can be exhausting and can make a caregiver feel all alone to carry the weight of the world.  Spiritual intentionality in caregiving means cultivating the capacity to give meaning to suffering to see problems and challenges which confront you and your loved one as opportunities for growth transformation and greater expression of love in the act of caring for another.  This process is just that -- a process -- and is not necessarily intuitive. It is certainly not easy and takes commitment but it must begin with letting go with realizing you are not in control of the circumstances. You can choose how you will respond to them. Will resentment and anger toward God rule the day or will you feel peace serenity and love?  It is obvious which would be the healthier of the two options for both you and the person with Alzheimer's and the process should be one of both giving and receiving. Those who only give and are not open to receive energy and presence and love from people with Alzheimer's disease often will experience burn out.  You may not be what you would call spiritual or religious. However the bottom line is that the road will be much smoother and the capacity to experience joy in relationship with people who have Alzheimer's much greater if you can acknowledge that you need help from God and that help is available.  Dr. James Houston Professor of Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver BC and a caregiver himself said in a recent interview:   The pain that is brought into God's presence enriches us for the rest of our lives but the pain that is borne in self-reliance and in a stoic fashion repressing all emotion brings death. In faith we have the wonderful knowledge that we are never carrying the pain of caregiving on our own.       In our opinion the question to be asked is not ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" but ""How do we and the ones we care for make the most of the present situation grow in the process and live as joyfully peacefully and lovingly as possible?""  We assert that to do this you really do have to make peace with God and learn to put away resentment.

He passed in Oct.2014 and my husband and I got rid of everything we had and moved in to care for his mom. She wants to go out EVERY morning for breakfast because her husband took her every morning. I have stopped going because she is up and down all night and I cant sleep well. So my poor husband has been taking her EVERY morning for the last 6 months. Now it would be one thing if she ate but she doesn't. and she complains the entire time about how bad she feels and how much she hurts etc.   The pain part we understand and are sympathetic to. However. She wants to go to breakfast at this one place. This is where when her husband was alive a group of seniors met. Her husband was a great outgoing guy and everyone loved him. Her not so much. But she goes because the "" gang "" will be there and the gang no longer come because her husband is no longer there.  And when they do come to eat its embarrassing and these people are turning away from her literally because she is picking at her nose and her teeth the entire time. It really can get gross. I have tried to talk to her as has my husband. She gets her nails done and ruins them in a day or two due to the constant picking at her teeth. The week it has costed almost 1000.00 to repair a tooth she pried the crown off of.

She's been able to walk w/her walker &amp; with assistance from me up until this past weekend. She had a major ""episode"" last Saturday evening and into Sunday morning: it started with her staring at nothing then muttering words or noises and finally with her playing with an unseen thread or something else between her hands....then it moved into severe shaking uncontrollable muscle spasms unable to speak even a single word. She was not ""present"" on any level and I was worried that she was ready to pass on... After a visit to the Hospice Dr she was diagnosed with pneumonia and is on antibiotics. She slept for 2 days straight and only woke up when I gave her meds or tried to get some food/water into her. Yesterday she woke up and was fairly alert talking a bit and eating again. She does keep her eyes closed most of the time but will answer direct questions.  The downfall of her being more aware at the moment is that she IS aware. She cries on and off most of the day. She's comfortable and not in pain that any of us can determine (expect for the pneumonia). She's scared and tired of living this way...this was something she was able to tell me this morning...The few times she opens her eyes when I sit on her bed with her or kneel beside her she looks right at me and cries.  It breaks my heart. I can't help her feel so helpless...how do I cope with her emotional suffering???

I have a three month old Great Pyrenees puppy.  Two or three days ago   I noticed he wasn't walking quite normally.  Seemed like he was having a little trouble with his balance when he'd turn.  I thought it was a back leg.  I took him to our vet and he found he had an injured right shoulder-nit broken.  Thought he'd be okay.  He gave him an injection of an antiinflammatory and one of Rimadyl for pain.  That was around 11am.     Late yesterday around 7 he vomited a couple of times lots of food.  About an hour later he began to have uncontrolled shaking of his head couldn't walk without falling.  I called out vet and we thought it was a seizure.  Got him into a dark quiet place.     This morning he is a bit better but is still having trouble with balance although he can walk some better.  Head is still moving a lot-kind of like Katherine ?Hepburn but more so.  Vet said to give a cup of milk and an hour later half a baby aspirin.  I've done that.  I don't know of anything he could have gotten into or eaten.  Tues. I saw him chewing an elm?I believe sapling leaves.  He does eat some dry cat food when he comes in.  Also feeding him about half a can of canned dogfood daily along with some Taste of the   Wild puppy food dry.     Our roads are flooded and I can't get out.  We live in Okla.

Caregiver Guilt     Guilt is an overpowering and complicated emotion but appears to have a purpose in the life of human beings. When knowing we’ve done something wrong by all means we should experience a touch of shame.     If you are a caregiver there will be times when waves of guilt will wash right over you. There doesn’t have to be any wrong doing to cause this. The simple reason is that you care so deeply that you never feel adequate performing this role.     For example you may finally get a chance to do something for yourself. Let’s say you go out to get an overdue haircut. The whole time you’re sitting in the salon chair you can’t stop thinking about something bad happening while you are away. You rush straight home instead of taking advantage of the rare and well deserved respite break. Even when you find to your relief that all is well you still experience that guilt monster.     Here’s another scenario. Your mother calls you first thing in the morning. She just wants to talk with you because the sound of your voice is comforting for her but because she suffers from dementia she forgets you’ve already talked and keeps calling every ten minutes. By the fourth phone call and seeing it’s her phone number once again on the caller ID screen you elect not to answer this time. Within minutes guilt starts swirling around inside you. (""What if something may have really happened to her?"") Next thing you know you’re breaking speed limits driving to her house to make sure everything is okay.     Then there’s always that ""little white lie."" You may be visiting your loved one at his or her adult living facility or the hospital. You need to be at work in a couple of hours but you like to have at least one hour to yourself before you begin your shift. Suddenly you find yourself saying ""My boss asked if I could come in early today so I’m going to have to leave now."" Meanwhile throughout your whole work shift you once again feel guilt doing somersaults in your stomach.      There’s not a caregiver out there that doesn’t worry about whether or not the job he or she is doing is good enough. Even after your loved one has passed you will go through a stage of beating yourself up wondering whether or not there was something more you could have done for your loved one.     The strong emotion of guilt that caregivers endure is just part of human nature. Go to a caregiver’s support group and ask all those surrounding you. They will tell you that they are experiencing or have experienced the exact same feelings. All caregivers face the same unattainable goal of sparing their loved ones the pain that comes with any disease. Everyone’s desire is to provide a compassionate passing.     Deep inside we all believe that we as caregivers are to some degree responsible for what happens to our stricken loved ones in the end. Sadly some endings can be downright cruel not only to the one afflicted with the disease but also to the ones that have to witness the perishing.     Caregivers get hit with a double-whammy. While trying to wade through all the sadness and grievance they get swept away by a pronounced tide of guilt. But take heart; this guilt trip will slowly start to fade finally leaving you with just the normal amount of grief which is bad enough.     With the passing of your loved one life has just spun around 180 degrees. Everything you have trained yourself to do has come to a complete halt. That grueling fast pace lifestyle you lived has just stopped itself on a dime. It’s almost as if you have to learn to breathe all over again.     Try not to berate yourself about areas in which you think you may have failed. Instead focus on all the positive things you accomplished along the way. Think of the enhanced quality of life you singlehandedly brought to your loved one. Remember you will remain in their heart forever.     Unfortunately guilt is a normal emotion in life. These bouts of guilt you feel only prove what a caring individual you truly are.

My husband and I spent our normal time with Deb today.  The only thing I can say is what her charge nurse at the SNF says and her hospice aide:  She looks like death's door knocking.  Her eyelids are so wrinkled and black.  Her face is pale and gray at times.  Her body is incredibly frail and shakes.  She sits in her chair watching tv or trying to sing or converse and just closes her eyes because she is just so exhausted she can't even hold them open.  I just held her and held her and held her today.  She wrapped her arms around my neck and just kept telling me that she loved me.  And I reassured her over and over I would ALWAYS love her.  We're having problems with her hearing aid and at this point in time I don't know what to do.  It's not the mechanical box.  It works fine.  I had the tubing replaced recently and that's not it.  It appears there's wax stuck deep inside the mold that goes into her ear which shuts off the amplification.  Of course since she's Medicaid in order to get a new mold made I'd have to take her to the one facility I know of in the area that does Medicaid hearing aids.  It's a good 45 minute drive from the nursing home.  She couldn't do that.  I don't have to take her.  Perhaps they could make an ear piece based on the last one.  However that would mean I'd have to pay for it instead of Medicaid.  Medicaid guidelines require the patient to be present.  And how do I know that she'll live long enough to even use it????  That's just one issue.  It's always something new.  My own body is in SO much pain and is SO tired.  Sometimes these days I wonder if she's waiting for me to go with her.  Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis for most of my life has taken its toll.  I saw my rheumatologist last week and he pretty much just shook his head.  I refused Prednisone because of side effects.  He tells me I need a lot of physical therapy and he knows there's not enough hours in the day right now for me to get it - so he told me to go see my pain management doc for him to try and sort out all the pain to see what is causing what and to give me injections under fluoroscope.  I've had enough of those to light up but I haven't had one in the last 2-1/2 years since Deb entered skilled nursing and I was told she needed hospice.  I'm so tired I can't keep things straight.  Someone on here recently asked how to keep balance.  I've been a caregiver for over 12 years now and I haven't figured it out.  I tend to the needs of my loved ones as best I can - but I don't know how to balance it out.  This journey is so incredibly lonely.  You lose your friends then there's siblings who don't help or turn their head the other way and don't see the toll it's taking on you or give you excuses as to why they can't help.  And it gets to the point where you wonder if you'll ever in your lifetime have any quality of life back.  I really think I've lost that.  I'm just at a very low point tonight.  I cried and cried over why Deb has to go through this and why God doesn't just take her quietly and quickly in her sleep.  I've prayed and prayed and prayed.  Maybe when the sun comes up tomorrow it'll be a better day.  I can only pray it will.,False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147519002,,,AlzConnected,,,

I click on but my heart nor my enthusiasm is not there to urge a comment. It has finally come to past that my Jane's total loss of being the person that I knew so many years ago is no longer available to me not even a hint or glimpse. My wife no longer walks talks has body responses to her surroundings nor offers me even a smudgen of recognition. I see her eyes starry and glossed.  When I visit my wife I offer up cute and affectionate phrases hoping to reach my wife of some 45+ years but the reward of my compassionate reaches are naught.  I could not imagine in my wildest dreams that nature nor the force of nature could steal the life out of a person while also leaving that person alive but only a responsibility to their surroundings.   Many on the Board inquire of what a ""Stage"" is or when it will advance. My wife has reached that overall 7 if there is such a thing. I take my wife's pulse and it is strong and in the 60's. But my wife's body is shrinking due to the pureed diet her Facility has her on because my wife no longer knows how to feed herself and/or chew and swallow. My wife is fed with a hypo device that draws the pureed foods then a Staffer presses the pureed foods into my wife's mouth. This is life?  No one can tell me my gentle and humble wife should be a statistic. It has been years since I wept based upon my wife's pain and suffering. Now I visit my wife and a little bit of me dies and leaving behind but a mental skeleton of  being I once was. I often feel gulty that I cannot offer more of myself to a scenario that has left me nearly without feeling.   There is not one move or legal function I have not done that is except place my wife into final Hospice. And when that next to final move will occur it is possible I will pass thru it without a change of emotion. Like my wife a lot of me has been lost.  I do hope that the members whom reads my composition herein will not have to endure the years of torment that Alzheimer can bring. But rather I hope the gap between realizing a Loved One has Alzheimer and the ultimate end is short with minimal pain.  Bless all. We deserve better.

These last few months have been so difficult with his passing mom's decline and my daughter's ill health.   Mom has been admitted to Hospice as of the first of June. She no longer knows her name has lost 19 lbs in about 7 weeks refuses to eat hardly anything and no longer talks. She mostly mumbles but once in a while she will make a statement to me or my family. We recently took my grandbaby up to see her. She loved seeing him and tried to pick him up and said ""he is heavy"".   This afternoon we took her a McDonald's smoothie and were visiting. I had been gone a week up at my daughter's celebrating the grandbaby's 1st birthday and helping my daughter as she dealt with 4 migraine attacks. These attacks are like strokes---paralysis and no speech. Mom doesn't understand but I know that she is being cared for at her Memory care by the staff and the Hospice staff.  I still feel a great deal of guilt as many of us do for our parents. Anyway today I told her I loved her and she said ""yes I know"". I cried tears of joy. We stayed about 4 hours. I helped her eat dinner and she ate fairly well. As we were ready to leave I leaned down to kiss her and she kissed my arm. I told her how much l loved her kiss!   I know that hospice is the best thing for her. She is missing my dad so much. She has tried to say something and I know deep down she is wanting to ask where he is but she just can't communicate it. And I won't say it for her because I know the pain would be too great for her to experience.   So for now I will cherish the infrequent kisses hugs and a her expression that she knows I love her.   Just had to put it down and share with people that will understand my feelings of joy and heartache all in one!!  Stage 7 is very difficult!

Since then she has not shown signs of pain so no morphine has been given. Her lungs are clear.    She says in all her years of Hospice work she has only seen one other case like my sweet mom.

My mother has lived with me for a year now and I am starting down the same path as you all have been on. We don't have an actual Alzheimer's diagnosis at this point-dementia only right now. I honestly don't know what goes into an Alzheimer's diagnosis. I know there are stages and you can't just throw the label out there. I'm sure I'll be finding out though in the months ahead.    I'm pretty mystified how you all do it. We're still in such early stages really and I'm just dead on my feet. My mother doesn't need constant supervision but I'm so paranoid that the day I go to the grocery is the day she decides to wander for the first time so I try to be around aside from the occasional chore run.      I have mostly stopped working. I work about 10 hours (5 hour shifts) on weekends because I need to maintain employed status and benefits not that I have time to go to a dentist despite the fact I have wallowed in such self-neglect for so long that I have teeth that have literally broken off and I just try to ignore the pain. My mother seems to do well right now with me going to work on those days (I think she enjoys the break as much as I do). I stick with the weekends because we moved to a white collar apartment complex so there are hoardes of engineers and computer techs around as opposed to Mondays when the entire property is a ghost town.      Her condition at this point is pretty much lousy short term memory and repetitiveness. She confuses her history and relationship titles. She can't recall if her brother died. She's always been a bit of a hypochondriac/anticipating the worst case scenario kind of person but that works in my favor finally. She does NOT want to go outside if I'm not there because she's convinced the door will lock behind her. She does NOT use that stove because the stove could start another Chicago fire if she touches it. I call to check on her and she automatically rattles off everything she's done/doing. She's quite a couch potato so basically she watches cat shows on Animal Planet.     I don't get breaks from caretaking. Ever. There is nobody to help me. I had to move her away from her home because I have 'those' siblings. It's beyond judgmental but totally uninvolved. My mother's sister is wealthy and in later stages of Alzheimer's. She's in a facility specializing in the disease. My one sane sister is her trustee and there is so much drama because she has the audacity to invest my aunt's hard earned money in her care rather than storing it up for inheritences.      Like I said it goes beyond judgmental attitudes. My siblings stalk swarm threaten lawsuits file false reports of mistreatment.  But they are loudly proclaiming themselves the protectors of the elderly posting about elder abuse and what righteous people like themselves have to do to make things right.          I just deleted six paragraphs of rambling about the siblings because it makes my throat constrict just thinking about their idiocy. That's a sure sign I need to step away from the stress triggers. No energy for a panic attack right now.      Did I mention I need a break?     I'm so tired of panic attacks and crying jags and rampant insomnia. I need a beach.     I wonder if I'll ever see a beach again. Or know how to breathe without feeling like an elephant on my chest. Or be able to get back to writing like I was doing before all this. Or ever have a life of my own.      Pardon the whining. My cat doesn't seem very interested in my complaints so I had to find a different outlet.,False,JoeyKay,2015-05-06,15.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147515639,,,AlzConnected,,,
866,621074c77b65de9a5b66d9be,2147515704,2015-05-26 07:44:00,Journey is coming to an end,My grandpa took a turn for the worst about a week ago. I saw him rapidly declining after a few days once he returned from custodial care earlier this month. Then all of a sudden he was sleeping all day even without meds and completely disinterested in food (he was always hungry his Alzheimer's had hindered his sensation of satiation). He came home walking and talking. Now all he does is moan and whimper in pain. He attempts to communicate verbally only when asked questions but it seems he is unable to.     He came home under the care of in home hospice and the nurses agreed with me regarding his time. It's been hard preparing my family and no matter what we will never truly be prepared. It's so heartbreaking to hear him and see him so helpless. The morphine barely does any good anymore.     To make matters worse my mother blames himself of his decline due to a fall he had just days after his return. The thing is he had come home physically stronger but it hindered him because he was putting himself in more danger by disregarding our methods to assist him with his mobility safely and unfortunately the simple desire to do things on his own terms and time (which is understandable) nonetheless he fell because he refused our assistance (would physically push us away verbally assault us to leave him be etc).      We have my aunt and uncle flying in from Peru to come make their peace with him but what's frustrating is that although I've clearly explained the situation to them time and time again as his disease has progressed they still question if we are doing all that we can. It's quite hurtful in addition to being offensive.      My grandfather is 95 we have done everything we can that isn't going to extreme measures which would only hinder his health in other ways.      We have been blessed enough that he wasn't affected too severely by this disease until after his 90th birthday. Did he have mild symptoms in his 80s? Yes but not so much that we could even notice it was only later that we could recognize some symptoms he had been exhibiting then. At 90 he was still tending to our rather large garden and his chickens in our backyard. There are others who lose loved ones to this horrendous disease at much earlier years in life so I feel it's not fair for me to complain that I'm losing him at 95. But it still hurts he and my grandmother helped raise me. I feel like I'm losing my other dad. They've been married what would be 70 years this December and are true love birds. I know my grandma will not survive losing him and this whole time I've been trying to prepare for losing him but haven't even tried for her. I lost my grandpa once he reached his late stages but now in losing all that I had left of him. I'm not ready to lose her too.,False,ALZBear,2015-05-10,14.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147515704,,,AlzConnected,,,

This disease has progressed to stage 6 (according to symptoms).  She has always... always...  had a STRONG desire to die of natural causes.  No BP meds no blood thinners no thyroid meds NO PILLS....  her entire life...  as was the thinking of her other siblings... all of which died in their homes....  all living alone...  and all with pretty catastrophic endings.     Now my dilemma is what to do with a possible UTI.  No pain no fever just smelly discolored urine.  she is adamant that nothing is wrong and she DOES NOT want to see any doctors.    SO... if I leave this untreated... even undiagnosed...  what and how does this progress.  I am on board with her being ready to die.  I understood all of that before she lost so much brain function.  But I don't want her to be or end up in pain.

My Mom has been diagnosed for around 10 years now and is cared for full time by my father.  I am an only child living in the USA but my parents are in the UK.  Mom has been getting steadily worse now for around a year and my Dad is finding it harder and harder to cope.  I was home in March and got lots of things set in motion (as my dad had refused any help to that point). It seems as soon as the relevant help is put in place she needs something different.  Mom is now on morphine patches to help with pain in her knees she is not eating very well and struggles to walk and is incontinent.    I try and call every other day respite care is set up for my Dad to use and they have a lady to come in and bathe my Mom 5 days a week.  We are currently waiting for help with having someone come to sit in with her so that my Dad can go out and shop as she started wandering when he was gone (they live in a first floor AL flat).  My biggest struggle right now is dealing with the frustration and anger my Dad has he seems to still deny the illness as a reason for the things she does or does not do and will not allow suggestions for me or his sister in law as he is ""dealing with it 24/7 and what would we know"". Today I called and he ended the conversation with 'I will talk to you later if i have not committed suicide by then'.  You can probably imagine how my day has gone since.

My mom also has severe nerve damage in her back and neuropathy in her legs which make her hardly able to move.  She had decompression surgery last year didn't follow anything anybody said and is now no better off after initially doing wonderful.  We're waiting on an appointment to see if the neurosurgeon wants/can do surgery again. Dementia or not my mom really is in a LOT of pain! 1st thing...I'm afraid if we tell the surgeon she has this he might not do anything. If you didn't spend much time with her you wouldn't know about the dementia. I don't want him to just write her off as ""old and crazy.""   2nd...her memory really isn't that bad but she insists she can do things she can't.  Like riding an exercise bike and she can't hardly walk with a walker. She also thinks she's capable of driving.  She says she can't afford Life Alert yet she can afford to buy my niece a new car!!! She lives alone but two weeks ago FINALLY allowed someone to come in for 15 hrs. per week to do housework. She doesn't believe the diagnosis because ""I can remember back to when I was three years old. I don't care what that doctor says!""  Is it possible to reason with them at all?  Also we do not have financial power of attorney over her nor will she grant it. Honestly..I do not want her money I just want her to use it to help herself!!!

871,621075417b65de9a5b66dbfb,2147515898,2015-06-03 08:43:00,Mom got sick went to hospital now on hospice &amp; not eating - what to do?,"About 6 weeks ago my mom w/about stage 5 AZ was living in AL but fairly independent given meds and reminders but otherwise no ADL support walking w/o assistance taking care of her 2 cats.  Then she developed a pain in her abdomen got taken to the ER admitted after about 5 days an NG tube was inserted 3 days later exploratory surgery was done and she ended up having a small bowel resection.  She was in the hospital for almost 2 more weeks after that then rehab for 2 weeks now back at her AL.     Pretty quickly after initially going to the ER she became very agitated confused angry.  Her mental state (dementia and depression) was a roller coaster the entire time she was in the hospital and rehab though never good.  Constant change of doctors nurses techs etc. was clearly overwhelming and she was unhappy and uncooperative most of the time.  She wasn't distinguishing being in the hospital with being at the AL (only moved there in December had just really started liking it there) and blamed the whole thing on me.     In the hospital prior to surgery she was eating okay as her stomach issues allowed.  After surgery she became resistant to eating or drinking even angry when it was suggested.  It's possible that this was somewhat tied to using the bathroom as after surgery her system wasn't working quite as she was used to and she would start to ""go"" quickly before she could get assistance to get up.  Plus she was very confused and unhappy with not being able to get herself to the bathroom was using but confused by the bedside commode (thought she was just going on the floor) and was alternately put in adult diapers or pullups so she also didn't understand ""going"" in them.     Although she was getting PT &amp; OT in rehab she didn't really understand why she was there and wasn't really participating/cooperating.  She continued to eat and drink very little.  She was depressed and didn't think she would ever see her cats (very important to her) or my dad (also w/dementia and also at the AL) again.  Explaining that exercising taking her meds and eating would get her better and back to her AL apartment did no good.     Rehab and the AL nurse determined that since she wasn't really getting that much out of rehab she should return to AL and to her cats to see if that would help with the mental improvement.  The day I brought her back she was pleased to be going happy to see the cats and seemed to be doing okay.  She was strong enough to walk short distances w/assistance and was using the bathroom (though wearing depends).  However despite offering her familiar food and drink items she still continued to eat and drink very little.  I was asked to provide a 24-hour ""safety sitter"" for the first weekend back to ensure she wasn't a fall risk reinforce using her call button for help.  At first it seemed to be going okay she was still resistant to some care but generally getting up and dressed moving about a little using the bathroom eating some.  After a few days she became more and more resistant/uncooperative with everyone wanted to do little more than lay in bed sleeping on and off and eating and drinking decreased.  A week after returning to her AL hospice was suggested and I agreed.     Another piece of this mess is her meds.  At first after going to the hospital all of her meds were stopped.  She had been on Aricept and Namenda for AZ plus Lexapro for depression and recently Remeron had been added which helped greatly in her adjustment to AL.  It took a while before the meds were restarted although they never gave her Nameda saying the hospital didn't have it.  Even after being restarted she wasn't getting them regularly because if she refused or spit them out she didn't get that dose.  Her Remeron was also stopped/replaced with Megace to stimulate her appetite until I asked to have it restarted because of the other benefits it gave her.  This inconsistency and no Nameda continued in rehab.  After returning to AL it seemed the meds were finally getting back on track until one day the psych NP saw her and - without consulting me! - decided to discontinue both the Aricept and Nameda because they didn't think they were any longer a benefit.  This REALLY angered me because she was doing very well on those meds prior to this and I wasn't convinced that getting them back into her system regularly wouldn't have some benefit.  I discussed this med situation with the hospice intake nurse and she discussed it with mom's GP and the hopsice doctor and they agreed to put her back on the meds for a month and see if they will again help her or not.     2 days ago the hospice aide was in and got her up and dressed and took her to have lunch (no idea if she ate) with my dad (he's in the MC unit).  Sometime after that when she was back alone in her apartment she fell.  As I understand it she just happened to be found by the hopsice nurse - I doubt she had her call pendant on unless someone made sure she did and mom's story is that she called and called for help and no one heard her until some people just happened to stop by.  Somehow I missed the notification call and when I arrived that evening after work she was in bed.  I was able to get her to sit up and into pjs but she wouldn't get up to eat or use the bathroom.  She did take her evening meds with some resistance.  From what I was told yesterday she wouldn't get out of bed or changed.  I think she took some of her morning meds but I don't think she ate.  When I got there after 5pm she was in bed sleeping still in her pjs.  She hadn't eaten any lunch some dinner was brought up but she wouldn't wake up long enough for me to get her up.  When aids came in about 8pm she had wet the bed and wouldn't get up to go to the bathroom or get changed so they just changed her and the bed with her in it with her complaining the whole time.  As soon as they were done she pretty much went back to sleep.  She ignored me when I asked her if she wanted anything before I left (she hears just fine so that's what she appeared to be doing as her eyes were open).  I don't know if they tried later to give her meds.     That long story was mostly background to ask if anyone has been through this kind of thing before and/or have any advice?  I don't know if I should just let her be and let her die or if I should be trying harder to get her up and moving and get her to eat and drink.  Am I being kind or cruel if I continue to not try anything?  I haven't tried feeding her as even with her eating very little she was sitting up in a chair and feeding herself - should I be doing that?  I don't know if this would be different if she had progressed naturally to end-stage dementia but this drastic change from how she was just 2 months ago is very hard to process and I just don't know what to do.

By this time we had generally assumed Grandpa had Alzheimer's and was mentally deteriorating quickly. I remember their last visit from Illinois before moving and Grandpa got lost on his daily walk. My grandma being the loving and caring spouse accepted her new role as his caregiver better and more willingly than anyone of us imagined.     But this was disastrous for her. She had to endure has her only lover and husband was losing his ability to balance his check book and misplacing his keys. Eventually she had to seek the help of a care facility for him but she went every day to be with him. My grandpa died in 2000.      Since then my Grandma has been by herself in San Diego she suffers from diabetes and chronic spinal arthritis. To deal with the pain she has been on percocet for the last 24 months. I moved here this year to assist her and to get a change in my own life. Since I have moved here I have noticed her fear for memory loss and general decay prevents her from making progressive changes.     For instance she has always been a ""collector"" I wouldn't say a hoarder but it's getting there. However the issue seems to rise from the anxiety of losing things. For example in Illinois they always had a bunch of extra stuff from years past they never threw away or wanted to give to someone etc. but in San Diego she saves things so she knows where they are.   If I leave my cereal on the counter I know how much I have left and where it is and I never have to look.   She won't put things away or change how the room looks feels functions beyond daily necessity.      I have been living with her for 6 months now and I have taken pictures of when I got here and when I cleaned or moved something. In her office room it was a single file path through the room with a chair at the computer to sit at. The rest of the room was filled with bankers boxers filing papers and shopping bags of things she ""needed"" but then lost the motivation to put away and forgot they were there.  In the 6 months I have been here I have not touched this room or anything in it without her directly telling me to grab something or do something. We are having a family reunion this summer and this last week I told her Grandma this weekend I'm planning on organizing the office before the reunion. She agreed and we talked about what I would be doingand what she did and didn't want done in there.   Then on Saturday morning she was visibly distraught and attempting to talk me out of cleaning the house despite her own children (my mother) directly asking her ""mom you aren't leaving the house a mess for us are you"". I waited until she took a nap and then I went about cleaning trying not to agitate her emotions or feelings or put her in a bad spot.      I know the basics of hoarding and that you can't clean what they don't want but we had talked repeatedly about the necessities of this room and what we need it for before the reunion and she agreed and even gave advice and suggestions.   Anyway this is not about the collecting but rather the response following the clean. I cleaned the room by reorganizing pushing the desk (literally 3 feet back against the wall) and stacking boxes on top of themselves. To create more room while throwing nothing away and allowing the vacuum to be run.  That evening after dinner I asked her to come and investigate the room she was impressed and seemed pleased and we went about the day.     Yesterday I wake up and she is in a fury about how I had to have thrown away this 70qt  plastic tub with her clothes in because she KNOWS it was in there and its not there now and shes needs those clothes.  Ok let's find it. There is no tub there is no clothes there was no tub there was no clothes I verified from my pictures I took earlier in the year.  I know where the tub is and what happened to it it is in her room with the clothes on it on the floor but she does not believe me she is positive that the tub was in that room.     This is the issue that occurs every single time something gets moved or rearranged. She had to endure the heartbreaking feat of witnessing her husband lose his memory and his ability to find things that I believe she is so afraid of having the same thing happen to her that she is incapable of change. To the point that I fear it is dangerous for her to be alone. I am afraid for her and I don't know what to do or how to even bring it up.      She openly declares her house and lifestyle a mess and that shes ""not the best house keeper"" but that's not what my aunt and mom have said. She was a strict neat clean housekeeper which I can believe because my mom was the same raising me. Then she openly admits she doesn't put things a way because she doesn't want to have to look for it or worry about where it is.      Issues like this plastic tub I am positive that the tub was in that room for some time probably even a year or 2 before she finally put her clean clothes from the laundry (have to travel from laundry through office) into her room. - I should note she uses tubs because ""that way it's easier to pack when I can't live alone anymore"" and her dresser is full of memories for her so theres no room for her clothes there.      I don't know how to get her to get a grasp on reality and escape from the fear. I know her activities of watching the damn news for 12 hours a day or law and order is not helpful seriously depressing every day and more new things to worry about. She is far from incapable physically to care for herself she simply desires to not change anything ever.

My gut tells me I am on the right track but I can't see where the track goes. The executive summary is that I am seeking advice about moving my wife and kids and parents to another state and how and where we might best utilize their limited assets.  Mom is in her mid-60s with Stage 3 early-onset Alzheimer's and Dad is 10 years her senior himself slowing down. They own a house near us in Southern California but on their fixed income they barely scrape by. I've watched my father's ability to handle bills and daily life decline dramatically as his role as caregiver increases. Even though Mom's symptoms remain mostly short-term memory problems and occasionally misplacing things Dad is withering and I do not expect him to cope long as Mom enters later stages. I sometimes think Dad may go first from the stress and emotional pain.  I am the only family capable of real help but I work full time and support a wife and two school-aged children. My wife works part-time too and we both want to move out of state because we are tired of struggling to make ends meet. Recently I was given an opportunity to work remotely which means I could afford live in a lot of places in this country that offer what I am craving for my family which is a smaller slower lifestyle in a more natural setting. My parents I think even without Mom's diagnosis are at a stage where they need the same thing and they would not disagree but the thought of anything challenging overwhelms them at this point. My Dad just doesn't appear capable of thinking about the future anymore and needs my help.  I see this as a crossroads where I may end up killing two birds with one stone. I could not only relocate my wife and children into a setting and lifestyle that suits us better but also position my parents near us where it is more affordable less stressful and possibly with better resources for both of them as Mom's disease progresses. I know I won't want to move Mom in later stages.  Although I have no significant assets if my parents sold their house they could probably net about $160k which would be their only asset. In addition to that I think they get about $4k a month in benefits combined. I know there are many places in the country where they could buy a house outright with that equity but I was hoping members here could help me think through other possibilities. Here are some of my thoughts:  - My parents could keep their equity money and just rent near us where their money could be used for more affordable in-home care and assisted living (which I expect they will need sooner than later). - We could join my parents in purchasing a property where there was a second living quarters they could live on which would make helping them much easier. Also if Dad survives Mom he could continue to live there. - We could rent out my parents' house which would pay their mortgage and net them an extra $300 or so in monthly income.  (Note: an elder care attorney told us because Mom has a surviving disabled child Medicare could not use the home to reimburse costs.)   Our first choice of states to move to would be Oregon and Montana to be near family but am open to others. Beyond that I would welcome any and all input because I know many of you have been through these situations and have much wisdom to share.,False,eastcoker,2012-08-06,15.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147515215,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mom lives with my husband and I and my 2 children age 8 and 11. She has been with us for 7 years and has started to decline in the last 6 months.     For the last 4 years she does not want to do anything but watch TV. She never moves except to eat (if she remembers) and to use the bathroom (if she makes it there)..She is only 68. She has Kidney disease and cant take pain meds but is in a lot if pain from her musle atrophy. She thinks something is wrong with her back because it hurts all the time but the orthopod said it is because as he put it ""lazy"" and she needs to exercise.      She falls quite often and I have cameras set up.around the house so I can check in on her throughout the day while I'm at work. She can still dress and bathe herself and fix something to eat once in a while but I have meals on wheels come out every other day just to make sure she is eating. She doesn't remember to eat so this helps.   She thinks she is fine and doesn't remember she has all these problems and has been to a million doctors that all tell her the same thing. GET UP AND MOVE! This is really taking a toll on my family's lives. We can't afford to pay anyone to help out and neither can she. She has no assets or savings or retirement. I need help so bad. I worry about her all the time.      She moved in with us from Michigan when we realized that she couldn't live on her own anymore and that was fine when she was active but now it's like I have a 3rd child. She leaves her stuff everywhere and forgets everything. She visits Michigan every year in the summer for 3 weeks to see her sisters but I am really worried about her going this year. She can barely walk at this point and refuses to use a cane or walker.      Now she is talking about moving back there and getting her own place Or moving in with one of her sisters. They all live with their kids And cant taje care od her. She is so stubborn though.      My husband sees how much strest I am under and when I have breakdowns it kills him. He tells her how stressed I am because she is asking me to take her to the doctor for the hundredth time for the same thing we just went for and there was nothing wrong or she wants me to get her this or that at the store NOW.  She thinks moving back there where I don't have to take care Of her Will help.  I am so stressed!   I have had the department of aging come out and evaluate her and the said we should get a power of attorney and living will revised but she refuses. She thinks I am against her. I am trying to keep her at home as long as I can but I am freaked out that she has this scheme to stay in Michigan when she goes to visit.   Is there any legal way I can get custody of her or power of attorney without her consent?      I am so worried because my relatives have no idea how bad she has gotten and she has then all fooled into thinking I am trying to keep her down and that she is Fine. She can barely walk for God sake. I had to help her get to the couch the other day because she literally could not get her feet to move. It's lime her brain donsnt want to talk to her feet anymore.     On one hand I would love to have my life back and not be so angry all the time and not be mad at my kids because I have to tell them to help clean all the time because gramma can't. But on the other hand I want her in our lives as long as Possible. What can I do?

He was diagnosed with onset dementia last year but only very recentlybegan ""struggling"" with the symptoms. Due to his PD I am unable tocare for him by myself and he now has 24/7 care in his home which isapproximately 4 hours from me. Due to financial concerns I have startedlooking at facilities for him to move closer. In the meantime I visit him 2-3weekends a month. This past month has been extremely difficult with hisdementia. Normally he allows me to give the caregivers off on the weekendsbecause he wants the time alone with me and he is comfortable with me caringfor him. However on my last two visits he has been very angry and paranoid.It has made it extremely difficult to visit him because he believes if I helphim in any way that ""I will use it against him in the future and use it asammo to have him locked away in some facility."" He refuses the help fromme but becomes physically aggressive and verbally irate when I then bring in acaregiver. It is so hard for me to see him in this state especially because itis all so new to me. The caregivers say he is a lot harder on me because I am theclosest one to him and so he blames me for what he is going through. I amtrying my best not to take what he says or does personally but I feel so guiltyand at a loss because I can’t take away his pain or take away his fears. Whatis really tough is I just don’t know what the right thing is to do. He asks meto continue to visit and says he is lonely and I am so grateful for the time Iget to spend with him but I almost feel like I am triggering his agitation byjust being with him because he lets out all his emotions when I am around. Ithink it’s a bit harder because I’m not yet 30 years old I am his baby and itis hard to establish myself as his caregiver or the one who truly wants what isbest for him. I am looking to join some support groups to hear tips on how tobetter handle his paranoia/ delusions and outbursts but would love somefeedback from you all as well.

I know he wasn't in pain but it's such a mysterious process. The hospice workers made everything so calm. I'm really grateful he was able to be in such a peaceful environment at the end.

On discharge we moved her to MC since it was a decision we were already trying to make. It took a couple weeks but she was just settling in going to activities making friends.    During the 5 weeks in MC she fell 3 times while in her room. All 3 were related to her cognition she was furniture walking instead of using her walker. Even with increased safety checks this was still an issue. The first 2 falls she sustained bruises but no major issues.      The 3rd fall she has a major fracture of her right shoulder along with horrible bruising everywhere. She is not a candidate for the shoulder replacement surgery so her arm is in a sling for at least 8 weeks while it hopefully heals enough to give her some mobility in that arm.     Even if she somehow miraculously physically recovered to the point she could go back to MC she clearly had declined cognitively to the point she is too great a fall risk to go back. She has no recollection of the fall or that her shoulder is injured though she says something must be wrong since I have this thing (her sling).     On Fri when the SNF doctor saw her she was receiving strong pain meds and was really out of it. She barely opened her eyes and only whispered one or two words. He changed the pain meds to lower doses more frequently and over the weekend she was able to sit in a wheelchair and she was talking to us.     Today he wants to talk to me about changing the Hospitalization choice on her POLST form. She had checked Yes for transport but he suggests I change it to No unless needed for Comfort.  We are also going to talk about stopping her Coumadin and switching to aspirin because of the frequency of falls. That means the risk of stroke may increase.      I know he will explain it to me but has anyone selected No for hospital transport for your LO? I'm curious to know how you came to that decision.

My Dad was recently dx'd with middle to late stage Alzheimer's and I've had to have him placed into an Alz facility as my mom passed away 2 years ago and with his sundowning and not sleeping at night I can't care for him at home. I feel so guilty for doing it but just having him spend one night at my home means no sleep at all for me. He has some moments of clarity but they're far and few between. He called me yesterday from the facility ranting about the same thing he always does...where are my keys so you have my wallet where are the dogs. It's a never ending conversation loop with him...but yesterday...yesterday after we went thru the same loop several times he said ""I feel deserted and discarded."" All I could do was try to reassure him that's not the case that I'd be there this weekend to see him and that I loved him very much. I encouraged him to get a cup of tea and take it outside to sit on the patio. After we hung up I sat on the couch and just sobbed for hours. I've been a nurse for 30 years but when it comes to my family I can't think like a nurse it's all emotional thinking with my heart. I feel so guilty that I can't help him or make him ""better."" He has so much anxiety and fear that I can't soothe for him. I feel like such a failure as a daughter to him and truth be told I wish he'd just close his eyes one last time and let his sweet soul be released from this monster named Alzheimer's. He's such a good man and it's just so damn unfair to him.

Our brother went early afternoon and left her by a little after 3PM.  She is used to someone being there from @ 4PM to 6PM and then setting her up for the night.  I just had a feeling about today so my husband and I went to visit her @ 4:30PM.     We found Deb sitting straight up in her chair glasses on tissue held to mouth and sound asleep like that.  For a minute I wasn't sure she was breathing and then I saw that she was.  She shortly awoke.  She acted very strangely the entire time we were there.  We could tell she was past exhausted.  She wanted me to play music on my IPad so I did but she barely sang.  Then all of a sudden she just got this look on her face that frightened me.  I asked her if she was alright.  The only word that came out of her mouth was ""Janet.""  Janet is her hospice nurse.  She then put her head down on the pillow on her bed and closed her eyes.  Scared me to death!  I thought she was dying right then.  My husband attempted to take off her glasses.  Upon doing so the screw came out of the frame and one of the lenses fell out.  Fortunately I had a glasses repair kit with me and we were able to fix her glasses.       With her head lying on the pillow she blew a kiss and waved goodbye.  Not typical for her at all.     She has already lived 2 years past what her doctor gave her.  I have lived the last 2 years wondering every day if that's the last time I'll see her alive.  Today I had an extremely hard time with what I saw.  She didn't appear in pain but it was very bizarre.       All through dinner afterwards I kept saying to my husband ""Was she asking for Janet her hospice nurse?""  I was worried that she was getting ready to leave us and wanted Janet to be there.  My husband thought she was just so out of it she may have been thinking of Janet and said her name.  I don't know.  I'm SO tired.  I've never been this tired in my life.

So much has happened lately I can't even remember what I've reported and what I've not reported.  This seems to be the big one though.  Deb's charge nurse told me on Sunday morning that it had been the strangest thing.  After having all kinds of absorption problems for 2 years and getting down to the point where she couldn't even take 4 ounces at some feedings and some days only taking 4 out of 8 tube feedings she was taking all 8 feedings around the clock for about 3 days.  The charge nurse was alarmed.  She said it could be some sort of rally.  Even though her mind was bad and she was so exhausted over the weekend she still took all her feedings.  Today I go to see her and the first thing I asked the same charge nurse was ""How are the feedings going?""  She responded that she had taken all of her feedings since probably last Thursday or so.  She comes into Deb's room a little before 6PM tonight to do the 6PM feeding.  She didn't even get 2 ounces in her and had to stop.  Deb was complaining she was full and the bolus stopped flowing into her.  The nurse just looked at me with a sense of panic.  She just said evidently things have turned back around.  Deb was gray today didn't talk much; and when I would speak to her she looked at me like she could hear the words but they weren't making sense to her.  I just had her hearing aid serviced last week so I'm sure she heard me.    Yesterday the hospice chaplain went to see her and the lady I pay to spend time with her twice a week was there at the time.  The chaplain invited her to stay for their ""church session.""  He talked to Deb all about heaven and showed her a children's Bible with pictures.  I heard Deb did very well with the session.  Now tonight she couldn't even take 2 ounces at a feeding.  I am WAY past preparing myself as well as I can for her passing.  I've actually begged God to take her a couple of times so that she didn't have to suffer anymore.  There's something very ironic about timing.  I had a mini meltdown at work today thinking I just couldn't keep juggling everything like this.  Having a chronic pain disease myself for the last 30+ years and juggling all of this has really taken its toll.  And now we're back to not absorbing.  Wow.    We'll just have to wait and see what tomorrow brings.  In the meantime Deb very tiredly blew me kisses as I left today.  We always part ways with blowing kisses and saying ""I love you"" just in case it's the last time I see her alive - that would be the last memory.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147515095,,,AlzConnected,,,

I knew not to move her and did a quick assessment of systems while we waited for the MC nurse and 911 to arrive. She said ""ouch"" every time she moved her left leg I was worried it was broken.  The paramedics were wonderful and asked about Mom's cognition and how far along she was in the disease. They really supported assessing her and NOT taking her to the ER if it wasn't necessary.  I was so grateful that they understood the problems associated with an ED visit for our LO with ALZ rather than insisting on taking her no matter how her eval turned out.  As it was they assessed couldn't reproduce any pain (she is tender on a bruise on that same hip but it was an old bruise) and were able to get her to walk without pain or limping.  We stayed for another couple of hours after the 911 team left to be sure she didn't show signs of concussion or her hip hurting with prolonged walking and standing.  All is well but I might skip mother's day next year!

He also has sun down effect. He's been hospitalized twice for it. I'm struggling with a couple issues.     1. He has several other disorders so he often has to see other doctors and do physical therapy as well as home health therapy. He is very angry about it. He does not want to see another doctor again. It takes quite a bit of maneuvering to get him to appointments. I'm not sure what I can do to help this situation. I started writing down what we have to do today and tomorrow and that helped for a few days but he is back to being very upset. I understand because there is so much going on but I'm at a loss. He has COPD CHF Afib chronic back pain from a work injury and a few others. He also just discovered he has gout a small brain tumor that just needs to be watched a growth on his thyroid and a cyst/tumor in his nasal cavity and base of throat. Currently he is on a heart healthy diet as well as a diabetic diet and a gout diet. He becomes very frustrated with all of it and says there is no compromise. Again I understand I'm just not sure how to help ease his frustration/anger.     2. He makes passive death/self-harm statements. This can range from ""Just kill me"" to ""Why don't I chop my head off"" to ""Just chop my fingers off."" The last statement is from not wanting to see the hand specialist about the gout in his finger. I'm at a loss how to deal with this. I realize it is his dementia but it is so completely painful. It is also upsetting because when I was growing up my mother attempted suicide several times and dad was always the rock in the family.     3. He can become agitated/combative/aggressive. Most of this is verbal but he also hits things whether it's a physical object or even hand to head. Yesterday he tried to put his hand through the cupboard. He has only been physically violent to others once which was during his first delirium episode. In that case it took 4 police officers to restrain him.

She is also 86. My Dad inadvertently and will good intention gone awry gave her 6 Percocets in the space of 12 hours Friday night after an ER visit that was because of a fall after an outpatient llast Wednesday to implant a generator to help her awful incontinence. Still following me? So you see she had an awful week. But anyway--since the Percocets she has been terrible. She had hallucinations confusion and combativeness. She is a little better now but incapacitated---having thinking trouble speaking trouble moving around and walking trouble. She can't be left alone anymore. WELL...I had called her primary-care doctor Saturday and he wanted her admitted to the hospital. I even had him say so to my Dad over the phone--and my Dad still said no she was better. I was disappointed and angry--not to mention angry that he had given her all those Percocets---ironically she was not even in pain! I was not privy to the incident at the time or I'd have put an immediate stop to it. At the ER she had a CT scan that showed she was ok after her fall.    Does anyone have any tips or advice?

Forgive me this is my first opportunity to put out my situation so it will probably come off as primarily a ""bitch and moan"" post.  I am aware that many of you have already lost your AD family member and/or have been dealing with it for a LOT longer than me.  KUDOS.  I can't imagine how hard the road ahead will be for us...  My boyfriend's Grampa is 76 with early onset dementia.  He's also dealing with Type 2 Diabetes High blood pressure/ cholesterol and has had 2 heart attacks a heart surgery and recently had 2 stents replaced.  He's also had issues with back pain for at least the last year I've known them which prevents him from walking comfortably more than 20-30 steps at a time.  He's still smoking cigarettes and refuses to quit (although really I feel we are enabling this because he cannot get himself to a store to buy them himself).  He's also an alcoholic and had his license suspended and is currently on probation for the next ~2 years (for the most recent of several DWIs).  Grampa thinks whenever he gets his inheritance from his mother's recent passing that he will be able to buy a car get his license back and go live on his own... We've talked to him about his need for medical care at least to fix his back and get him mobile and possibly to address some dementia medicines etc.    My boyfriend has 2 small children that live with their mother and their situation is far from ideal there and he is in the long and drawn out process of trying to gather all the necessary documentation to fight for joint or sole custody (while trying to get his existing visitation order enforced).  The added pressure of trying to care for Grampa led us to moving in together (they both moved in with me) so they had a fighting chance at caring for Grampa's needs.  Grampa has 3 grown children one of which is constantly in and out of jail another who is still Grampa's legal Power of Attorney (since he was formerly supporting Grampa until the family felt that he was stealing money from Grampa and only providing bare necessities) and the last one  can't ""Deal"" with her father for more than a few days before shoving him off on anyone else.  So it falls to Boyfriend to take care of Grampa.   Grampa does not make enough on his modest pension and SS check to afford assisted living much less a nursing home situation which I believe he is already very close to REQUIRING.  He is very neglectful of his surroundings.  I've gone back and forth with Boyfriend about this stating that although I get that Grampa has dementia I also think underneath any medical diagnosis he is JUST PLAIN LAZY.     * He will take food out of the fridge (say a leftover pork chop) take a bite out of it and put it right back in the fridge on the bare shelf without even a paper towel or plate underneath it.     * He will program the microwave to reheat something (for 58 MINUTES) and then walk away and frequently waits too long to check on his food resulting in burnt containers and wasted food (not to mention the SAFETY hazard here).   * He never cleans up after himself nor does he attempt to 98% of the time. * He leaves his cups wherever he finishes his drink.  Every time. * He only goes for ready-to-eat foodstuffs (he has starved himself all day in a house full of fresh food just because it was not put together into a meal already and then complain when we get home about how hungry he is) or he'll just eat cereal all day until someone cooks for him. * He let the water dispenser in the fridge door run all day (went defective) which flooded the whole house floor and he never tried to call either of us to let us know even though our numbers are in his cell phone and written on the fridge.   * He's lit cigarettes on the gas stove when he can't find his lighter even though there is NO SMOKING allowed in the house.   * He leaves food in his room (even in his dresser drawers) which I worry will attract pests.   * He waits until ALL his clothes are dirty before letting us know that he needs some laundry done even though we ask him every other day if he has anything he wants thrown in the wash.  He gets agitated when we ""treat him like a child"" and go into his room to see what the laundry situation is though. * I have had to install a locking doorknob on our room because he will frequently attempt to get around his daily cigarette ration by sneaking into our room when we are not home to search for cigarettes.  We are trying to moderate how much smoking he has access to because of his multitude of medical issues and he gets angry and yells at us when he's run out of smokes for the day and we won't give him any more... I keep saying we should just tell him ""tough luck"" and never give him another cigarette again. *   He's called 911 for a tummy ache and believes the ambulance rides are free only to get to the hospital and refuse medications and be sent home and then we get the bill in the mail for his ambulance weeks later.     He seems depressed and sleeps a lot.  He will usually wake up around 7-8 am smoke watch the news.  He always takes a midday nap for 1-2 hours and then dinner and bed by 9 usually.  He's either on the back porch smoking or plopped on the couch 95% of the time he is awake.  The other 5% is bathroom breaks and mealtime.  And blowing into his breathalyzer 3 times a day which we have to stay on him about especially the AM and PM times.  Even when it is in the same room as him he has no problem letting it beep incessantly every few minutes during his 2-hour windows to blow... it's AGGRAVATING.  He gets indignant when we ask him to get up off his butt and walk the 8 feet from the couch to the blower and just DO it when it starts beeping.    It's depressing just watching him sit there all day with nothing but boredom on his face but we can't take him out anywhere because he can't walk very far.  He won't accept a cane or allow us to buy a wheelchair so we can have more options because he is ""still capable"" according to him.  He just doesn't seem to give a f*** about anyone or anything but himself already and since Boyfriend has no other suitable options to provide care it looks like we are stuck with a bad situation that will surely only get WORSE and WORSE and WORSE and the years roll by...   We are looking into local alzheimer's support groups and trying desperately to make all of this work.  Boyfriend has quit his job so we have someone to stay at home with Grampa during the day but he still has to pay child support so we're trying to start a side business to help with expenses but the mountain is SO big and seems like it will continue growing faster than we can climb it....  My initial questions to you Family are: 1. How do we go about moving his Power of Attorney over to Boyfriend instead of his Uncle who was stealing from Grampa?   The Uncle will not meet with us to discuss but we are becoming increasingly concerned over what Uncle may try to do when Grampa comes into his inheritance.  They tried getting POA notarized at their bank but that resulted in the bank refusing to sign as well as putting a HOLD on their joint account.  I've also informed Boyfriend that he needs this in place for medical reasons if an when decisions for Grampa's care need to be made etc.  2. How much should we be restricting his diet and cigarette habits?   I feel it is our duty not to allow him to smoke himself to death or overindulge in sugar since he's a Diabetic but the anger from Grampa when he goes without these two ""luxuries"" adds undue stress to the situation.  Should we just let him do what he wants with his money and his health (buying/smoking cigarettes and eating ice cream whenever he asks for it)?  Right now Boyfriend only wants to allow him so many cigarettes per day and because Grampa would just chain-smoke his daily allottment in just a few hours and then be begging for another one for the rest of the day Boyfriend has been giving him one every couple of hours but Grampa is now constantly ""stalking"" him around the house when he wants a smoke but won't say why he's hanging around until he is asked and then he gets angry and says ""Well what do you think?  I WANT A CIGARETTE!""  We've gone back and forth giving him his daily allottment and rationing them for him since he can't control himself and ends up just aggravating us even more when he's jonesing in the evening and has already had his allotment for the day.  3. What (if anything) can we do to get him more engaged in helping HIMSELF and cleaning up after himself?   Maybe this is just a pipe dream already...   Again my apologies for the silly little rant above.  I know the road ahead is going to be long and tedious and I'm really worried about where it all goes from here.

I believe this is related to starting a new course of PT; she has not been very ambulatory for many years due to NPH.  Got her to an ortho who gave her a shot of cortisone and said that PT is the only remedy to assist her arthritis.  Well she's still having a very high level of pain.  The doc in her NH prescribed prednisone to rule out ligament problems vs. arthritis. No pain relief aside from Tylenol and Advil.    Nurse on her unit says the only thing that can be done is send her to the ER.  That's just ridiculous.  And they would give her pain meds in the ER.  So I called the DON and they said doc would take another look tomorrow.     I called alz.org and they were horrified that someone would be left in pain for any reason.  Advised me to call local ombudsman who said if I wanted to file a complaint they would do an assessment.  Mom thinks only answer is to have a knee replacement.

She gets confused can barely keep her eyes open etc. It tends to hit towards the end of the day.  Last night she was sound asleep at the dinner table.  She accepted liquids through a straw and ate a few bites but was really in a stupor and mixed up.  I heard that she had been awake and ate well during lunch. But a few days ago could barely stay awake at lunch so they put her to bed and she slept 5-6 hours till I got there at dinner time and she was still in bed and sound asleep. It took an hour of having her sip gingerale through straw to have her finally wake up.  She seemed more clear then but very weak. Ate a little bit.   The next day her nurse said she was brighter. At first I chalked this up to a cold she's had plus her anemia and my ongoing concern about her meds. But when I saw her sound asleep at dinner table last night I got worried. I've seen similar behavior before when she had a severe uti two years ago.  So I mentioned my concerns to the supervisor and she said mom might be getting a bug  I also mentioned my concern it might be a uti and she said they had been checking her temperatures and there wasn't that sign of a fever.  Mom runs very low by the way- 94 and 95.  She said it would come up a bit if she had one.  She said something about they don't like to check for these without seeing elevated temp HUH??  I researched symptoms of a UTI and it doesn't look like fever is a requirement unless it spreads to the bladder. And I know we all know on this board about silent uti's.      Anyways this doesn't sound right to me.  And I've gotten resistance before from nursing about asking doctors to check for uti's as mom doesn't have the burning pain and other symptoms you might have in an older adult.  When she had the uti two years ago it was a visiting nurse practitioner from the old practice that suspected it and had the test ordered not the nursing staff. I'm frustrated and confused about this response by her nursing home. Mom could also have another issue-she's do to have her thyroid checked but I would like this checked out.    How do I address this resistance- or lack of education even???  I'd like mom's doctor or the one on call this weekend alerted to  change in mental status and to have medical things checked out. I plan on going over there today and checking on Mom at lunch and talking to the supervisor.

He has aunts who lived to be over 100 and he may well do the same.  At the same time he showed a decline in cognition after his bout with post-anesthesia delirium.  I can't really say for certain but dad may be in an earlier stage of dementia although it doesn't appear to be progressing fast (not like my mother who had a very aggressive form of dementia) - in fact I have not perceived any change in cognition since the one caused by the post anesthesia delirium after his colon cancer surgery.  Mostly he seems fine but he was having problems paying his bills prior to me moving him - but that seems to have been going on since his surgery.  But then he is 90.     Yesterday I took dad to my dentist - who is one of the best in the entire area and has state of the art equipment.  It is apparent dad has periodontal disease.  I think his last dentist made a real mess of dad's teeth based on the closeup photos they took.  Then dad got his teeth cleaned which he later told me was painful (I don't doubt it with the swollen gums and the deep pocket near a back tooth.)  Dad didn't tell the hygienist she was hurting him which is unfortunate as she would have done something to mitigate the pain.  My dentist's office specializes in pain prevention.  I will explain this to the hygienist - I didn't know he was in pain either and I was in the room with him and the hygienist the entire time.  But a few hours after the appointment dad said his back tooth (the one with the deep pocket) felt much better than it had in a long long time and he has decided he now has faith in my dentist.  The hygienist had put antibiotics in the deep pocket in hopes of reducing some of the infection and swelling before dad has his teeth fixed and she does the deep cleaning.  This deep cleaning of his gum pockets will be done with his gums numbed.     Has anyone had this done (deep cleaning of the gums to control periodontal disease) to an early stage Alz/dementia patient?  Will dad be able to tolerate this?  They are estimating it will take 1 hour to fix the broken fillings and 2 hours for the deep cleaning.  I'd appreciate any advice about this.  I have a friend who had this done and he was numbed first and said it was OK but he is also 40 years younger. I'm just uncertain about my dad.  He's 90.

Hard to tell how aware she is of anything  as she seems to sleep all the time except grimacing   once in a while if she's being moved.

My mom is in the later stages and I have been caring for her for 4-5 years now. It has been a blessing to be with her but also a challenge at times.    She has recently regressed considerably and we have had to adapt. I am trying not to send her to a care facility because we have no money outside of Medicare.     Anyway she is slowing down her eating. I have read that a tube doesnt really help and may cause her more pain. How does one handle this after we have changed her food to soft foods and feed her ourselves. She doesnt drink liquids much either. We try to give her foods she likes (yogert ice cream apple sauce) and use them to mix in her meds. I guess I am asking is she just going to stop eating and die? Is there something else we should be doing? She threw up a little this morning. Is that normal? She stopped walking and can barely say a word or two just since last month.     Also should I be looking at this point as one week one month 3-6 months left? What was your experience and what other things should I be looking for?,False,Muchacho,2015-04-24,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147514998,,,AlzConnected,,,

Quick background - Mom had a fall on Feb 11 of this year which propelled her right into stage 7.  Minor fracture to her pelvic bone but her dementia raged while in the hospital and when she returned to the nh a week later things didn't really improve.  Dr. tried various anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety meds and nothing seemed to really work.  Zyprexa caused her blood pressure to drop to alarming levels and then they discovered a UTI and began aggressive treatment with antibiotics.  Dr took her off all meds except Exelon antibiotics for UTI and aspirin to thin her blood.  Just this week he began Trazadone (12.5 mg daily to start).   Mom began periodically spitting out her food about 2 weeks ago and then regularly last week.  On Friday they discovered more blood in her urine and today they found blood in her stool too.  I should add that my mom got a pacemaker in 2009 and that it's been functioning well even when her blood pressure is wonky which tells me my mom may suffer a long time.     It appears something is going on with mom beyond her dementia and what we thought was a UTI.  Her blood pressure is raised today and the doctor has asked that she be taken off aspirin in case that is what is causing her bleeding.     I'm just so scared.  I know my mom is not going to get better and I know that a peaceful passing would be a mercy but it seems as though we've fought so hard and now it's come to this.  To top things off I'm alone in her care (with my husband and kids) since my sister died 2 years ago.  I can't help but feel I've let everyone down (most notably my mom) even though I visit her daily and have tried to do my best for her.     I hate this disease and whatever it is that is causing my mother such agony.  She seems to be in so much pain.     I will await the results of the many tests the doctor has planned for her but I suspect the end is near.,False,AnnaBB,2015-03-24,32.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147514635,,,AlzConnected,,,

He's been angry and hostile since he arrived. He has refused food refused to get out of bed and has lashed out at the aides.  He did recognize me on Thursday which was nice. He was very confused of course and asked if I had talked to his dad. I'm so glad I've been reading posts here for months so I knew to say yes. He was time traveling all over the place. I'm hoping some of that is the hospital delirium and being in yet another new place.  T  hen he fell AGAIN on Friday night. They took him to the ER and luckily there was nothing broken. Today the psych doctor saw him adjusted some meds and added Trazodone.  In many ways I can completely understand his anger. He's in an unfamiliar place people he doesn't know are shoving spoonfuls of awful mushy food into his mouth he's in pain he's tired he doesn't understand what's going on - I would probably lash out too. I also understand that he can't endanger the staff. I'm hoping they will find the right level of meds.  They said that today they were able to get him out of the bed and into a wheelchair so I'll take that as progress. I'm see him tomorrow. Hopefully he'll remember me but if not I'm mentally prepared. Emotionally is a whole other matter of course.  I do not have great feelings about this rehab facility. They're not abusive but they just don't seem to give a damn. I understand they have a job to do and they don't love our LOs like we do. I have tried to introduce myself to everyone be very polite but also let them know he has a family who cares. I don't know if that makes any difference. I only have one week left before I fly home and I'm really hoping Dad can stabilize and start doing better.   After they told me how much the nursing home costs I'm praying he can go back to his AL facility and enter the MC unit there. It's a bit less expensive and SO much nicer. They have told me they want him there but og course will have to do an assessment.

(ran out of money) She thinks I am her Cousin she hates her children so I guess its best she doesn't know who I am. One of my biggest frustrations is her addiction to pain meds. I give her her meds and she comes back every 5 min. wanting another one because she hurts so bad. When I tell her it is not time she gets very upset with me and goes off telling the people in her head that I am taking her meds.   She has been living with us for almost 3 months now.

908,621078607b65de9a5b66ea8c,2147513772,2015-03-07 06:34:00,Division in family,"My mother has moderate Alzheimers. I have fundamentally great differences with my stepfather and half sister how to care for her.     My family put my mother in an Memory Care unit Christmas a year ago.   My sister had picked the place and let me know after she had made arrangements.      My sister and step father have taken over her finances and care with no input from me.      Background - my sister had a bad relationship with mother and didn't speak to her for 10 years. She even said to not call her if mother died or she would hang up on me. Mother reached out to her and they had an improvement in their relationship. But there is still hurt on my sisters side. My sister has always been close with my stepfather.      I have a chronic illness and have been diagnosed with subthreshold amnestic MCI. Mother and I have always been very close.   We made the mistake of not getting a will together. I didn't want my stepfather to feel mother had made arrangements financially that would show favoritism. My stepfather raised me since I was 3 so I assumed it would work out fairly.   Mother also wanted to live in their home. They had a big home on 17 acres. In her bed she could look at birds and squirrels and there was plenty of money for her to be taken care of.   Well things quickly changed and mother was put in Memory Care without being told Christmas Eve. She was visiting witn people and then looked around and her family was gone. She was with strangers and had enough cognitive skills  to know she had been abandoned      I live out of town about a three hour round trip. Which is very hard for me to drive with my physical fatigue pain and brain problems with concentrating and reflexes.      I desperately want mother up by me. My sister can only come see her every few weeks and then it's for a 30-30 minute visit as she brings Toilet paper or something. She works about 15-20 minutes away but is very busy taking care of my other sister and fatber. My father just doesn't want to visit her. So I am the only person who will come check on her care take her out to go to the zoo or out to eat those kind of things.      I want to have her by me so that if she is upset or not feeling well I can pop over. I could bring mother down to see them s couple times a month and it would be way more than they see her now.      We disagree on quite a lot. Moms room was bare and sterile. My sister said that's what Mom needed. No visual distraction      I went to Dollar store and bought all kinds of stuff to put on the walls and lute extra things. Candy dish. Etc. mother was so happy!  She kept talking about it for weeks how it felt like more of a home. I managed to get a phone put in her room after months but they took cord away so she couldn't call my dad.      She has severe shoulder pain from leaning in her arm while in bed. I have begged them to buy an adjustable bed frame so she could raise her head so she could watch TV while in bed. She has no head board. But they say she couldn't use it. She had one before and I think she should be able to at least try to use one. The attendants could help.      They refuse to give me any money to spend in mother as they think I would go crazy. This is a one room bedroom. Not sure how you can go that crazy. There is quite a bit of money that they have. (in Texas there is community property.  So I would think fixing my mothers room up with some curtains pictures would not break their bank.   I am now living at 20% below poverty level but spend money I should be using for utity bills on gas to go see my mother and take her places.; room decorations taking her out to eat parking for dr visits zoo entrance feed.   My sister brings clothes from Goodwill for mother to wear despite the fact that everyone there dresses very nicely. Now I know I'm not alwYs right. And I think that they think they are doing the best for mother. But I want to figure out how to deal with our differences.      I am so devastated thinking of my mother far away and so lonely. She knows her husband doesn't want to see her. She thinks she is not attractive. She begs me to come get her. She wants me to take her to a movie go to church with me etc my home is a single wide trawr and my son who is dealing with a devastating illness and his wife are living there until they can move. I have no heat or AC and my septic system was backed up for several months and now the floors are popping up. So not s good place to bring her.      I just want to have input into mothers care. I have tried to be supportive of my sister as she had a lot on her. But I just want them Tory me take over mother. We have always been close even best friends really. I have actually begged to get mother moved by me.   I told mother and told her that they wanted to be able to see her (she rolled her eyes and said ""BS!""). I said I wsnted her by me. She said PLEASE!! PLEASE!   I told her I was concerned that the longer she stays there it will make it very hard for her to  Make the move up here. She understands. I feel I have a very short time to get her up here to make the transition. I am getting where it is getting harder and harder to drive on the freeway and overpasses. I may get to the point where I can rarely see her and as I am the only one visiting taking her out and just totally understands her  she will be abandoned.   There is always concerns to be dealt with. I think my family thinks you pay a nise sum each month and you shouldn't have to do much of anything. Just bring candy a shirt from Goodwill every now and then and some decent toilet paper and you've taken care of her.   I had to get her an outside geriatric specialist as mother was in so much pain she was wailing all the time. The de there said it was depression. Took her to dr and they said she had severe narrowing of her spine and severe arthritis. Another time I found out they had run out of mothers pain meds 4-5 day earlier and just hadnt gotten around to getting it refilled someone needs to be seeing her at least 3 times a week.      Sorry so long. Just no one to talk to. And I want to do what I can for Mom.",False,Jshu43,2013-04-04,42.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147513772,,,AlzConnected,,,

Yesterday morning when she got up she said her stump kept her awake all night she was having some pretty bad muscle spasms in it...something she has not had in months. (She had one leg amputated below the knee several years ago) She was scared and crying and I called the doctor's answering service and (bless him) the doctor called back within 20 minutes! He said to give her a muscle relaxer double her pain pill for one dose and add 3 tyle nol and rest her stump on a low heating pad. Between no sleep the night before and the medication she slept pretty much all day yesterday ate 2 or 3 bites of supper and then slept the night through. She slept so soundly that she wet the bed so when I got up at about 830 this morning my stepdad was up helping her clean up and she was crying that she was sorry...it went downhill from there.    When home health came out she is back to being unable to write her name afraid she is going to wet the bed (we have another twin bed for her out in the living room) and afraid of falling unable to tell us her age or birthday.  The doctor had us cutting back on her haloperidol and I know she was doing better last week than this week...She is sleeping again right now and I am just waiting on the doctor to call back. He had the nurse come out to draw blood and I think we need to put her haloperidol back to last week's dosage.     I called and left a message at the doctor's office this morning but still have not gotten a call back.  We spent the day listening to mom talking nonsense things and repeating herself over and over.  She is also moving VERRRYYYYY SLOWWWWW in everything that she does.  She has been eating supper for about 30 minutes or so now.  Not that she is chewing especially slow but moving her arm very slow staring into space for a minute or two then slowly putting her fork in her mouth.     I did feed her a couple of bites with her medication to be sure she took it and she insists that the last pill did not go down...I gave her a couple more bites and then some pudding and some water checked and rechecked her mouth and it is empty.  I asked her if the pill was still in there and when she nodded I asked her which side it was on....she looked at me like I was stupid and said it was right there on her tongue!

She stared at the door unsure if she was hoping for someone to knock and enter; or if she wanted to just walk through that door and leave her loneliness behind; but this was “Home"".

She sobbed and shuddered with these sad memories and the sight of the door in front of her. She knew it was all there fun laughter and even love; just on the other side. All she had to do was open it and walk through; but No ! She sat there resignedly and told herself that she wasn't like that. She was too proper too shy and too old.      The Anger just wasn't there yet. Her tears continued to dowse the fire within her soul. The day would come though. After the tears had dried she'd put down her coffee cup stand up ready to grab life by the throat with both hands and pull him to her.

John's death was really hard for my Dad and it is something that he thought of often when he was still cognitively all there.  He now thinks that my brother is successful and living in another city which in a way I think could be a really good thing for my Dad so he doesn't have to have the hurt in his heart from the devastation of losing my brother.  But I also worry that thinking that he is still alive will make him wonder why he doesn't visitand the last time we spoke he asked me from my brother's address and phone number?  I'm not quite sure how to handle it.  I would love for him to believe my brother is alive so he doesn't have that pain anymore but don't want to cause another problem when he is worried he can't speak with him.  I know that this is a pretty normal thing with dementia but I don't want to break my Dad's heart twice by reminding him of such an awful moment in his life.

She will be seen by the Geriatric Psychiatrist on March 24---he is under contract with the nursing home and comes there often.

Prior to my arriving at the nursing home for this morning's meeting I emailed the Activites Director with an extensive list of my friend's past interests and activities.  I included everything I have done todate both successful and not so much so she would know what has worked with my friend.  I forwarded the email to the a Unit Coordinator so folks are kept in the "" loop""... She in turn sent it on to the Social Worker and is planning to have the information in writing at the LNA station so they can use the information to engage in conversation with my friend and use it to help redirect her.     The Social Worker encouraged me to attend the monthly support group at the nursing home...she keeps offering...and suggested I try to set aside my 30+ years as a Social Worker and Counseling Psychologist in Gerontology and long term care and let myself be the  friend ...it is apparently time to take care of myself. How many times in my career have I said those same words....and I know she is right.  😊. So I came home put the next support group meeting in my calendar.  That was at least a first step...the real step will be for me to actually go.     I am glad we had the meeting this morning.  Maybe my head and heart will become aligned someday....in the meantime I will   always   be the Advocate and maybe I will be able to set aside the deeply ingrained Social Worker/Counselor part of me....even if it is just during the support group meetings.",False,Friend,2013-04-30,194.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147513898,,,AlzConnected,,,

As she is recovering I get the brushing done very well and efficiently but I don't poke or prod unecessarily nor have I looked.  She falls asleep early so I'm not getting as much fluid in her after dinner as I would like  Therefore    I wash my hands and nails thoroughly then put a bit of thickened water on my finger and she takes that in...less than a drop  My thought moistening her lips/mouth.  Sometimes she really takes in that little amount to such a degree that she rouses and then I give her drinks of water-  Whie doing so the other night she awakened and became alert and oriented then began smiling and giggling  I took the opportunity to look into her mouth= one of her incisor teeth broke off at the gumline----I did a gentle sweep of her mouth in case the tooth was in her mouth...no tooth. The break at the gumlilne but I could feel the ragged remaining part of toothshe did not flinch when I proded so there appears to be no pain- she eats pureed at this time post seizure  .  When o  The same breakage happened to me a week ago while eating a hamburger.  No pain. however when one eats regular food like me the remaining tooth can be further damaged which can then cause pain so it is advisable to get the remaining part of the tooth./ root out which I did.  And it hurts!  Not umbearabe. I will call the oral surgeon but I sure don't want to put mm through having a pulled tooth along with AD however she's always been brave and a trooper and can tolorage pain ...however I have to check to see what if any pain meds can be used while she takens AD meds and seizure meds...I can help with the several hours of initial bleeding but it is not fun to try to eat with an open wound in ones mouth..tips? I also learned that with an extraction if you sleep in an as much as you can upright position such as in a lounge/ recliner   chair there will be little if any swelling = little if any pain.  The only pain is the hole in your gum!  TIP  Frozen petite peas are the best ice packs because they are maleable unlike a traditional ice pack... have several on hand to rotate when bag 1 is thawed and in need of re freezing.  I had the wherewithall to move food to the side of my mouth that didnt have the hole so I was able to eat somewhat... maybe I can give mom foods that slide down her throat aka soup...nothing that requires even chewing of pureed????Thoughts?

918,6210793e7b65de9a5b66eeae,2147513984,2015-03-15 14:26:00,Mom's journey came to an end on 3-12-2015 and I blame myself,Mom died Thursday March 12th @7:35 pm after 2 weeks in the hospice house. The first day I took her there she was eating and could toilet herself with assistance. But from that day on she quickly went downhill from there.     I am so upset with myself and I blame myself for her death. Had I not taken her there to get her medications under control perhaps she would still be alive today. Obviously not cured of Alzheimer's but nevertheless alive.    Then my little brother started saying that Mom died due to a morphine induced coma from the doctors and nurses at the Hospice house. Of course his statement has no documented proof that's what happened to our beloved mother and is merely his own opinion which is enough to make me feel like I was to blame for her death because I didn't get her out of there and into a hospital for hydration and off morphine.     He said he read about this going on. He said there's even class action lawsuits for exactly this reason.  He said Mom wasn't in any pain and should have never received morphine. He does not have any medical experience or training observing people who are in pain versus not in pain.     He said Hospice was originally created to care for those suffering from cancer not Alzheimer's. Some people believe that euthanasia by morphine overdose in elderly Alzheimer's patients is happening every day in Hospice Houses throughout our country. I pray that this is not true. That the Angel of Death does not exist in these hospice homes.     Fellow caregivers please be diligent. Do not let your guard down. Ask plenty of questions. Do not assume anything. Be vigilant. And if you feel you have any doubts regarding the care of your your loved one get answers.     Mom has not been cremated as of yet. I have checked into costs for autopsy's more so for my peace of mind. The costs are very expensive to have a private pathologist to preform it. And then you have to pay extra all depending on what exactly it is you are questioning about her death.  Hospice knew my mom was going to be cremated. Mom had stopped eating and wanting fluids but I have read where the morphine Seroquel and Ativan can cause people not to want to eat or drink.     I am so very upset with myself that I allowed her to go to the Hospice house to get her medications under control instead of them keeping her here at home and doing that. She died under their care at the hospice house. I know Alzheimer's is an incurable disease and she was getting weaker losing weight and her appetite had declined.     I hope I can find peace with myself. I tried to do the best I could on her behalf. She went with me willingly that day I took her there she trusted me because she knew I had her best interest at hand.  I told her I was so sorry that that was happening to her.     I know she is whole again now that she's passed. I know her suffering confusion and agitation are all gone. I should be happy about that but I just cannot let it go that because I took her there it was my fault she died.     I haven't even cried yet. I feel sick to my stomach but not sick. Almost like sick butterflies feeling. I cannot go into her room without feeling this feeling. I only wanted the best for her. I loved her with my whole being. There were times she was very difficult to handle with her sundowning and agitation and restlessness. But we got through it. We managed those times.     There were many times I didn't think I could make it through another day if it had not been the kind folks here on this blog I don't know what I would have done. For all of you that took the time to read my post and who gave me support to stay strong on Mom's journey I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You kept me sane dealing with this insane disease and for that I am eternally grateful.   I am mourning the loss of my beloved Mother.

919,621079d17b65de9a5b66f131,2147513165,2015-02-11 17:16:00,1st Post - Terrible experience trying to get my mom diagnosed... and how to deal with hygiene issue...help!!,"My mom who just turned 86 years old has many of the 10 Alzheimer's symptoms that are described on this website.  There is also a family history of Alzheimer's including her brother and her cousin.    About 1.5 years ago after speaking at length with my mom's family practitioner about my concerns he referred us to a local neurologist for diagnosis.  That turned out to be a terrible fiasco.  The doctor's opening remark was laced with profanity.  He was aggressive and demeaning and he ignored my request for discretion and said to my mom ""your daughter thinks you have Alzheimer's.""  The doctor didn't interview me separately and he would ask for me to validate statements in front of her.  The visit caused my mom noticeable angst and emotional pain and she sobbed for hours after the visit.  My mom can't remember anything but she sure can remember this event.  We had enjoyed an outstanding relationship my entire life but this 30-minute office visit gave her pause to mistrust me and that seemed to start us on a downward spiral.  I never followed up with this physician nor have I sought out another doctor because of the horrible experience.  In the last several months I have seen a serious cognitive decline in my mom.  While we've had an ongoing problem with her personal hygiene (months between hair washes re-wearing dirty and urine soaked clothes hiding soiled underwear and Depends throughout her room etc. etc.) the problem has gotten much worse of late.  Yesterday while my mom was with my daughter I cleaned her room and found about 20 pairs of urine soaked underwear and Depends hidden throughout her room including behind her mattress in a drawer filled with photographs in the airduct on shelves among clean clothes etc.).  When I asked her to give me her dirty clothes today she refused then ended up shoving me and ultimately hitting me in the face with her used Depend after I caught her trying to hide it.  She was screaming at me and unfortunately I was screaming right back.     After reading the message boards for the last couple of months I realize the need for a clear diagnosis but it is so difficult to think about putting her (and me) through something so emotionally painful again.    I need some recommendations from members of this message board for the following:    1)  how to go about finding a good quality kind provider (and is a neurologist the first diagnostician to start with or should I start with a provider of a different discipline)...her family practitioner has been of no further help;   2)  how to deal with issues about hygiene...especially her seeming ""need"" to hide urine and poop soaked underwear and Depends...I can deal with so many of the other issues but this one sends me reeling!!! 3)  everyone on the message board seems to have such good control of their emotions...what's the secret...how do you do it?  I appreciate any input and recommendations that you will have.  Thank you so much!",False,rudy36,2014-12-27,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147513165,,,AlzConnected,,,

Unfortunately the rehab doctor started him on Seroquel 25 my per day and 500 my of Depakote twice a day in the last 2 weeks he was there because he was supposedly very disruptive and overwrought. That caused his sodium to drop to low and now we're back in the hospital 2 days after bringing him home.   My problem is that my sister thinks I was wrong to bring him to the hospital and should have just let him pass away. Since getting his sodium levels back up he is alert communicating knows who everyone is and the doctor says we can still give him good quality of life. As health care poa I'm in agreement with the doctor that we have a neuro assessment followed by a palliative care assessment to determine how to move forward.   My sister wants to just do the palliative care assessment take him off all meds that aren't for pain/comfort and bring him home. The only meds he's on are for medical conditions like high blood pressure prostate cholesterol and the alzheimers.....and in my mind removing them is wrong while he is still able to enjoy his time with my mother and other family.

922,621079ef7b65de9a5b66f1bf,2147512501,2015-01-15 23:01:00,Mom with Dementia now Dad with Parkinson's - what to do?,"My mom we all know has dementia - If we had a diagnosis I'd say stage 5 or 6.  But the neurologist we took her to when we first became really concerned about 4 years ago said ""vitamin b-12 deficiency"" and we haven't seen a neurologist since for her. 2014 saw significant decline in her cognitive abilities.    My dad is her primary caregiver and he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's - which we've known he probably had for a while but just saw a different neurologist last week.  He has an MRI coming up because his cognitive function is very slow and the Dr. was concerned.  My dad is almost 80 and still works by selling products online.  My mother can no longer drive or cook or fully care for herself.  Now with dad getting worse by the week I don't know what to do. He can't sleep has pain and tinnitus and is just so completely stressed by all of this.  I took 6 weeks off of work to try and get things organized for them and get them services and in home care but he ended up refusing it all.  He does not want anyone to come in.  I have had to cut back now in an effort to keep my own sanity since I do have a full time job and a family in order to show him he really does need someone to help -and that was upon the advice of my counselor and doctor.  Here are my questions:  1.  Should I ask my mom's new Primary Care doctor to get a referral to a neurologist to see what kind of dementia she has?  Mom gets angry when we talk about it so we never bring it up.  But she cannot remember after two minutes the answer to a question she asked it's very weird and she's just not the same person.  We all know she is deteriorating but we don't know what from.  Is there even a point?  Dad is getting cognitive testing and an MRI but we don't know if it's even worth the time/grief to try and get my mom in.  2.  How have you convinced your parents to accept in-home help?  They are so self-reliant and stubborn and despite all my efforts I cannot convince them to pay for an in-home provider (they were denied financial assistance).  I've paid to consult an attorney brought in senior services contacted in home providers took my dad to the VA to get help....and he ended up refusing it all.  3.  Does anyone know how much risk a child has for developing either of these diseases when both parents have developed it in their 70's?  My grandparents died in their 60s so we don't know if they would have developed it.  My concern is that I am not yet 40 but have bee having increasing memory issues for years (I'm notorious for forgetting my own life events) I am beginning to have increased trouble finding the words or names of people I should know (seldom have been good at names though but words is really annoying).  In addition over the last 2 years I'll increasing get twitches in my hands and the other day ended up with twitching and then uncontrollable continuous flexing in my leg while driving for no reason.  There's more but I'll sound like a hypochondriac I'm sure.  Mostly it's my memory that is bothering me.  Perhaps most people aren't bothered by this but I'm reading where symptoms of PD and AD are actually seen up to decades before diagnosis. The other problem is that much of my family has variations of auto-immune disease (I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis my daughter has type 1 diabetes and celiac disease my dad has ulcerative colitis as do several of his grandchildren and I think my sister and my mom has hypothyroidism). Is that in any way correlated with dementia?  It's a long first post but I've been working up to this for months.

A bit of background...  My mom is a hypochondriac and had been addicted to prescription pain meds on and off since she was 16 and broke her tailbone when in highschool. She also has had one leg partially amputated and is in a wheelchair. Before all this started she was able to transfer herself from bed to chair to commode.  She has also been an insomniac for years....about as long as I can remember so her napping at unusual times is not out of the ordinary.     She was at the neurologists office and fell asleep in the waiting room...both my stepdad and the doctor were unable to rouse her and after a quick exam the doctor said she was having a seizure of some sort.     Since then she has been in and out of the hospital with various diagnoses. They said it was seizures they said it was a heart attack at some time in the past they said she was having mini strokes a UTI pneumonia dementia a blocked artery in her neck a dry kidney low potassium dehydration....on and on it went and no one could or would  confirm anything.  In the meantime her regular doctor dismissed her as a patient after several missed appointments...oddly enough he dismissed her AFTER I went to his office asked his nurse about getting her an appointment and the doctor said he would only see her if we admitted her to the nursing home that HE was the director of for long term care....which when we refused long term is when he dismissed her.     The various doctors she has seen over the last several months were not communicating with either is or each other. They finally told my stepdad to bring her home and just let her expire.     I quit my job and moved cross country a month ago to stay with her. My stepdad is overwhelmed and when we came to check things out 3 weeks prior to my moving....the house was a shambles.     So...here I am.     We now have mom under the care of ONE doctor.  We have had the doctor take her off all antiseizure medication because no one ever witnessed a seizure and between the different doctors she was on 2 different antiseizure meds 2 other meds that could be used for seizures and about 25 other medications. She would either be in a drugged sleep or awake and crying for help.  Her current doctor has her down to 11 medications....two of those being vitamins and one other is a nebulizer when needed.     My first job ever in my life was as a CNA in a nursing home so I am familiar with caring for people...but right now it is the change in her personality that scares me a little bit.  The last month that I have been here I have seen her improve both physically and mentally....but the last couple of days she seems very restless. It is so bad today that she would ask me to put her to bed then immediately ask to be put on the potty and then as soon as I tucked her in and walked from her room to the kitchen she called stepdad in and asked to get out of bed.     This has been constant from yesterday until tonight. She also has not been eating much at all either day. She does have a feeding tube in but it only runs at night and her goal is to be able to eat well enough that the tube can eventually be removed.     I see a lot of posts about patients being restless or pacing....could this be her version of that since she cannot get up and walk herself or...?     I have tried to make sure its not just boredom watching different movies watching her favorite movies playing backgammon trying out a puzzle and I also got her a page magnifier so she can see well enough to read again.  I also check to see if she is hungry or thirsty needs the bathroom or just doesn't feel well and all i can get out of her is 'I dont know why',False,LaNora1,2015-02-25,29.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147513525,,,AlzConnected,,,

I let her home health nurse know about it this morning she said it sounds like anxiety.  I dont know what to do. I am keeping my very patient face on when she asks and doing as she asks but then I go into my room and cry.     I did get a nap today but am still feeling exhausted. At the risk of sounding like a whiny crybaby....I do have a few physical problems of my own with my back and lower joints. And now my neck is bothering me today...something that usually doesn't bother me.     I did get a nap today....sometimes she will stay put if she knows/thinks I am napping but stepdad said she was up a few times.     I tried talking to her about it as she seems pretty lucid but she just says she doesn't know why. I ask if she is in pain and explained that she had not been asking for pain pills so we had not given them to her bur I started giving them to her again last night.  She had one with dinner and said she slept ok last night I gave her one this morning and afternoon too. She can have the 3x a day.   Her pain levels aren't making sense....she said she was at a 10 and 20 minutes later was at a 3....which is not her usual process. Actually I cannot remember the last time she was below a 5 in pain in my entire life.     When she asks to be moved so soon I ask about pain hunger bathroom and anything else I can think of...all she says is i dont know.

She is probably stage 5 going on 6 but is still mobile but with severe arthritis. She never got sick with the virus that was responsible for the quarantine. She is on pain medicines every 4 hours but of course forgets that she has had a dose and will ask for a bottle of aspirin to keep in her room.  I can usually deflect that request and redirect her attention but for that reason I never never take her in a drugstore or Walmart or anywhere that might sell over the counter medicines. When I got there yesterday she had pulled out an empty bottle of her makeup and said that she needed a new bottle and sure enough the bottle was completely empty.  As I took her out to lunch I was trying to devise a plan so that I could avoid taking her in a drugstore to buy a replacement bottle.  We were in a shopping center with a department store and as we had plenty of time she suggested that we could go to the department store as she remembered (!) that they had makeup.  I have never bought my own makeup at the department store counters as it's way too expensive but I was so relieved at that suggestion we went right to the store.  Sure enough they had a big makeup counter with a cute friendly salesgirl behind the counter.  She sat my mother on a stool and proceeded to try out several different shades of makeup and identified one that would be a good match. My mother said ""Oh this is so nice. I have never had this done before.""  When I paid for the bottle I about choked at the expense but fortunately my mother did not hear the price.  The salesgirl then gave her some free lipstick on top of that.  Mission accomplished no drugstore new bottle of makeup and a good experience on her first trip out of the facility in a couple of weeks.",False,HSDaughter,2013-10-12,63.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147513733,,,AlzConnected,,,

Tonight I called to check on her to see if she had eaten her dinner. Since she didn't eat her lunch. I was told she ate only a couple bites of her puree dinner.        (I feel the reason she didn't eat her lunch was the fact they had given her a dose of Ativan to calm her down from a morning outburst insisting it was a very low dose.)     Plus the nurse informed me they started giving her  roxanol ( morphine) 7.5mg     Mom had been on Haldol but was told today they discontinued it.      She's also taking two doses of Seroquel 50mg. once in the morning and once at night. They are also giving her a dose  RISPERDAL      at night   .               When I took her there they told me to expect her to be groggy since they were going to try to adjust her medication to control her behavior better.              So I need and want your thoughts on this....             When I took her there on Thursday night she could toilet with assistance she could talk and reply to questions being asked of her and she ate almost all of the dinner they gave her.  It was soft diet.              Now she's soiling her diapers she's not eating and drinking and I do not believe in my opinion this has been brought on due to the progression of the disease but rather the medication cocktail they have been giving her to get her under control.              Also I was told she's receiving morphine which was a complete surprise to me. I asked the nurse why she was on that and the nurse told me Mom was in pain. Really? WTH?               Here's where I need your thoughts I am strongly contemplating going over there first thing in the morning to dismiss/fire the hospice team including their doctors and bring her back home with me before they kill her from taking all these medications.

I live in the same house with my mother who has undiagnosed dementia (she refused to be tested a year or so ago) and my two elder brothers. The house is both my mom's and one of my brothers. I am the primary caregiver for my mother. I've never been a patient person. I've never had any kids so perhaps I never had to really learn patience. I am the one who gets my mom up in the morning showered and fed and the one who gets  her to bed at night. Some days are fine but others are nightmares. Until we got a new shower and got rid of the tub shower she was going weeks without showering. I couldn't get her in there if my life depended on it. So many arguments. Then we got the new shower installed. I can pretty much get her in there daily but some days she refuses to even get up. Today was one of those days and thanks to her not getting up she soiled herself. I couldn't get her to take off the night dress to shower and put on a clean one. She accused me of soiling her night dress. So there she is in her soiled night dress in clean sheets that were washed from her soiling them earlier this morning. I wash sheets and bedding and night dresses daily. I'm tired. I have fibro so am in constant pain. I try to be calm and pleasant but I fail...a lot. I have a short temper. I get  it from her. We have argued are entire lives. My only relief is going to work every day. But I still have to get her ready in the morning and by the time I come home I have to continue taking care of  her. My brother's help with the laundry and one of them cooks supper but that is pretty much it. I have a part time caregiver coming in twice a week since December for a total of 10 hours.

She had some test that rates a score 1-16. Mom scored an 8 16 is normal and 4-6 is Alzheimers. Anyone know what test this might be? After a month of treatment my mom refused Namenda. It's been 4 weeks off medications for memory and depression. I don't know what happened to my mom's antidepressant I think the doctor forgot. Mom was calm peaceful and able to engage in long conversations medicated. She remembered details and followed more than one topic in a conversation. Now mom is off her Namenda and Celexa and she is angry every day. She convinced her pain doctor to give her Lyrica so she decided she ""will never"" go back to the neurologist again. My dad will not stand up to my mom and help her with her meds. I am ""not welcome"" to go to their house because mom is mad at me. 2 months ago I hid mom's Ambien and Fentynl and Vicodin  at her home because they are not prescribed currently and they can be dangerous for her. Mom does take Percocet and gets steroid injections for her back. I tell mom to ask the doctor for medicines. I tried saying I threw them out but day after day she yells and threatens to call the cops. Dad would love me to be there but he is guided by mom's anger. I directed dad on how to help and how to get mom's records from the psychiatrist and neurologist when she was hospitalized and dad asked mom's permission (not advised...more anger...). Mom is not dangerous enough for me to ""prove"" incompetency yet. How do I take control when she is able to get by without any help currently. She is still intelligent but making decisions that are making her life harder. It is not how she would have wanted things. I'm failing as her daughter but my hands are tied. I recommended hiring a nurse or social worker or care manager. My brothers and dad have the money but I don't. I can't afford help. I don't know how to get Mom help when she consistently refuses and verbally lashes out to me dad and caretakers. Mom consistently asks doctors for her choice of drug and eventually she gets what she wants. I wish a doctor would notice that she has probably had 30 different prescriptions or vitamins in the last few months. Medicines are constantly changing because mom is the one constantly demanding things. I know how to manage this but she refuses my help. Does anyone have advice? Do I have to wait until mom declines to be able to help her?

He talked about the test mom had that has a score from 0-16. Mom scored an 8 and 4-6 is alzheimers. Mom interpreted that as she is normal. Mom told the doctor that she will NOT take the memory pill. She was taking Namenda for the last month. The doctor did NOT give her a new rx  because mom refused . I am upset at the way this was handled by the neurologist. He should have still given her the rx. He knows how much trouble and anguish we have had if he read my three page letter we gave him. Dad said the neurologist did not interview dad separately. Separate interviews with care providers are the standard recommendation in dementia. I am disappointed mom and dad did not get that.  Furthurmore the neurologist perscribed the antidepressent and it was not discussed at the office visit. Mom was doing so much better now we are back at square one.  I am discouraged. We have called the doctors office twice regarding mom's nerve pain pills lyrica or neurontin and the recoptionist does telephone triage and gives out medical advice that she has no business giving out. I asked dad if he would sneak out of the house tomorrow with his DPOA papers from mom so that we can get mom's records and make sense of what is going on. Dad thinks the DPOA is only good when mom can't make her own decisions. We don't know if the psychiatrist determined competency in the hospital but regardless dementia diagnosis might be enough for dad to take on his DPOA role. The problem is Dad is too passive and he does not ask questions to understand. He lets mom run the show. He lets mom tell doctors what to do and in the culture of defensive customer service medicine mom is getting what she wants. Dad told me that at the neurologist office they talk so fast about medicines he does not know which one they are talking about and it's hard for him to keep up.   Dad called me this morning. Dad said that mom is fighting with him more often and she is angry. Dad agreed that the episodes of anger were a lot less in the last month while mom was medicated with namenda (dementia pill) and celexa (antidepressant). We have to figure out how to get mom back on these pills. She started to make a scene in front of her grandchildren yesterday. She wants her Ambien back (no longer prescribed to her and a VERY dangerous drug that could be live threatening if she takes it wrong). She repeatedly demanded I give it to her. I am going to tell her that I disposed of them. Dad has told me that mom drank whiskey while on Percocet (very strong narcotic). If mom did that with Ambien and Percocet and alcohol she could kill herself. I can't let that happen. She is not safe to handle that dangerous of a drug. She sleeps fine. She gets plenty of sleep and rests all day long. She does not need a sleeping pill she needs activities to do every single day so that she is tired enough to sleep all night.  I told dad we will figure this out but I'm worried that there will be more outbursts from mom now that she is off her meds. I'm worried they won't make it to Florida as planned in March. Mom was less stressed calmer and happier on her meds. She had more reasoning skills and her memory was better. I'm at a loss at how to figure this out. I'm thinking we should have some family meetings. I want my brothers to learn the anguish my dad is going through. Second we need a plan on how to deal with mom in relation to these medicines. At this point I'm afraid that if we all insist she will retaliate again with another 3 weeks of rage that dad will dance around again. I don't know how to approach this. The anger outbursts ruin my mom's day repeatedly.  For now I'll plan to call a care counselor tomorrow at the Alzheimers association I know they will have better advice for us. We really need a geriatric social worker or a geriatric case manager to help us out as a family. How do we get mom to agree to see the social worker? The goal is for mom to be happy and have peace and we saw a lot of that when mom was medicated. Unfortunately she still had crying episodes and we just need to do more to help her feel happier.  We can figure it out if we work together and get the right resources. It is just hard to figure out how to get mom to agree. I am disappointed with the lack of referrals to resources this far. I feel like this is my best resource better than all of the doctors. I need more help to help my mom. She was herself again on the medicines. I really don't want her to make a scene again in front of her grandkids. I don't want her to do anything dangerous. It's hard to worry about her all the time. On the meds she was very stable.   Any advice? Sneaking the pills on her is not an option. She was a nurse.

I had posted earlier on my FIL being verbally abused by my MIL who has AD.  Well both had been assessed by a geriatric team and the recommendation in the fall was for my FIL to start Aricept as he was diagnosed with MCI.  He is 87 and they had to follow up with a cardiologist because he has an atrial flutter.  He has quite severe balance issues and is also suffering with fairly severe hip pain at the moment (had an xray and will be going for a CAT scan).  I believe that he has gone downhill extremely fast with the stress of dealing with his wife's AD and her behaviour.  While he forgot occasional things before he is now forgetting more major events.   The cardiologists/geriatric doctors met and decided he should be on Aricept but that in order to do so he should have a pacemaker installed.  I am very biased about this after reading an article in the NY times ""What broke my father's heart"" (google that if you want a real tear-jerker of a story).  All I can think of is that my FIL is not is wonderful shape now at 87 and having a pacemaker may prolong his life beyond what nature may have in store for him.  It will also mean that he is taken off his blood thinners - he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol which I fear may put him at risk of a stroke.  What my BIL (who attended the appointment) did not find out was what the risk is of putting him on Aricept without the pacemaker.   I constantly struggle with feeling that sometimes doctors do everything to solve the immediate problem but don't necessarily look at the entire picture.  I think in some circumstances we may be going to extreme lengths to preserve life expectancy at the cost of quality.  This may not be a popular thought - but I am thinking of my own wishes when I get to that point.  I also consider my own family - my father passed away last year at the age of 93 - with all his faculties and physically in wonderful shape with the exception of his heart which was basically worn out. He went quickly painlessly and with great dignity.  How wonderful and I realize that's not possible for a great many out there. I do not think my FIL has the ability to grasp the situation and make a decision the way my father would have.  He is of an era that listens to whatever is told to him by experts and really hasn't had a voice for many years due to the way his wife basically made all the decisions (they are also British and do not talk freely about a great many things).   It is very hard for me to pull back from this situation - I am the one in the family who researches everything and is more aware of things in a medical sense.     Lately I am wondering about Parkinsons - I noticed last visit that his hand was shaking while he was resting in his chair.    Am I being too opinionated?  Does anyone else have LO's that have had experience with pacemakers etc?  I am less concerned about the procedure than the long-term consequences of having his heart beat on regardless of the rest of his health.

941,62107ba47b65de9a5b66f9dd,2147512666,2015-01-22 14:29:00,Feeling Alone(1),Hi this is my first time visiting and writing here. My 86-year-old dad was diagnosed with vascular dementia about a year and a half ago. Last week he went into the hospital for an illness-induced delirium and his behavior meds were changed. He has become too much to handle for my mom so he went from hospital straight to rehab/memory care where I think he will end up staying.      I know it is the right thing for both his and my mom's safety but I am so sad and worried about him being there. I worry that the staff there doesn't know my dad -- the man he really is when he's not confused disoriented sedated or combative. I worry that he's not eating or taking his medication. I worry that the past two mornings I've visited he was so drugged up from the meds the night before he couldn't even manage to keep his eyes open eat or participate in his physical therapy.      I worry I sent him there to get the right kind of attention and better care than he was getting at home yet after a few days of being there he looks hunched over and mentally worse than ever before. Last night he got so upset he bit two nurses. He's been agitated before but he's never done anything like that.     I've tried my best since he was fist diagnosed to take care of his needs help my mom and be on top of everything. Now I feel out of control of his care. I wonder every minute what he's doing if he's ok. If I have done right by him.      I know there are so many of there out there that have experience this pain and so much worse.

942,62107bdb7b65de9a5b66fad1,2147489263,2012-06-24 10:28:00,When your LO won't eat.,When your loved one won’t eat.                     There will come atime in the course of dementia that your LO will stop eating or eat verylittle. Sometimes this is temporary but often it becomes a major concern.               The following suggestions may help:              Look for a physical reason. There are many physical problemsthat would bring about refusal to eat.    Check for:               Dental problems.       Loose teeth tooth ache soresfrom dentures canker sores or other oral issues.                               Physical issues . Pain fromarthritis or other physical condition. Headache. Urinary tract infection etc.Constipation may also be an issue. A visit to the doctor to rule out physicalproblems may help.               Depression.    Most people with dementia will have some level of depression. Even ifthe person is on an antidepressant it may need to be adjusted. Be awarehowever that some antidepressants decrease appetite and some will increase it.Ask the physician.               Visual Problems .   Can the person see the food? If they wear glasses and don’t have themon this could be a problem. The person could also have agnosia a term used toexplain what happens when the person’s brain can no longer process what the eyesees.               Older people lose more than half their taste buds by thetime they are 65.     Food may tastebland. Try enhancing the taste with products such as No Salt a seasoningalternative to salt.               Check for swallowing problems or pocketing of food.      At some point in later stage dementia theperson will no longer be able to swallow normally. Coughing and choking may bea problem.               Look for possible side effects of medication  . Checkthe side effects of any new medications but even if someone has been on amedication for a long period of time this is still a possibility.    Some medications can reduce appetite andothers may cause digestive problems.                          What can caregivers do to help?              Check to see if the person needs more help eating? Are theyconfused by what they see on the table? Here are some steps you can take.               Use help aids .   There are many help aids for people who have problems eating. Theyinclude such things as plates with rims to help keep food on the plateutensils that are easier to use and sippy cups for adults. It may also help toreduce clutter on the table serve the food in a solid colored plate on acontrasting mat and avoid patterns in table cloths.               Try serving one food at a time . Do not placeeverything on the table at once. For instance: serve a small salad or somethinglike applesauce. Remove it. Serve the main plate of food remove it. Serve aslice of buttered bread remove it. Serve desert.    Keep a beverage handy for the person to sipbetween bites.              For the person who is having difficulty with utensils andhandling the food there is a step between independent eating and being fed.  Trybreaking the task down . Encourage the person to do such things as: pick upthe fork put some meat on it put it in your mouth.    You may have to  Help the person getstarted.     Place your hand over theperson’s hand. Help them to grasp the fork or spoon put a small amount of foodon it and guide it to their mouth.    Doingthis several times can re-establish the physical pattern in the brain and theperson may be able to finish on their own.              You may have to  demonstrate chewing .    It may also help to  gently stroke thethroat to encourage swallowing.                   Short attention span may be a problem.  Feed the person ina quiet room and remove any distractions.               Make sure the food is warm not too hot or cold and flavoredwith mild spices.              If the person is no longer able to handle utensils at alltry finger foods. People with dementia who are still able to self-feed seem toeat more. Use a bib or towel to protect the clothes.                 Other things you can do:                  Avoid pressuring the person to eat .    Try not to increase anxiety at mealtimes.This will only make the situation worse.               Try feeding 6 small meals instead of 3 large ones.     Make each bite count. Focus on protein highcalorie items and nutrition dense food.               Consider comfort foods and don’t forget treats.     Try such things as peanut butter and jellysandwiches Nutella macaroni and cheese hearty soups (these can be pureed ifneeded) cheese and crackers ice cream and pudding anything the person liked to eat before they gotsick. Try making their favorite recipes.               Increase exercise if possible.      Taking the person for a short walk outsidecan do wonders to increase the appetite.               The late stage dementia patient:              The person in the last stages of dementia will eventuallylose their appetite and then their sense of thirst. This is a signal that thebody may be shutting down. At this point the body is no longer able to digestmetabolize or excrete nutrition normally. Forcing them to eat or drink willonly cause distress and may put them at risk of aspiration.    At this point the person with dementia isusually bed-ridden totally incontinent and very confused. Most families willuse hospice for support at this time.              Stephanie Z,False,Stephanie Z,2011-12-15,4217.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489263,,,AlzConnected,,,

I was late 30s and in military shape. I didnt think about helping him I just attempted to grasp him fairly gently and pul him to a standing position but he Yelped.   Wait!  wait wait wait..   I hadnt realized he was not yet ready for me to assist his body into movement.  I never thought much about him or anyone else needing some adjustment time to get ready for physical assistance. I have a back injury that no one can see  but that is often times very very painful. Especially when arising from the bed or sometimes even a chair.  I know my injury will never get better and will likely get worse as time goes on. I hope I never need help from caregiversnursesor anyone who is not aware that it takes me a certain amount of time to get up from bed.   I cannot just get up as most people would think.  I have to get my legs over the edge first and sit for a moment to let my back adjust from lying to sitting.   I cannot go straight into a standing position I would want to fall  from the pain and shock.  I write this in hopes that my fellow caregivers may consider their loved ones might also need some adjustment time before being moved from one position to another.

My LO is scheduled for hip replacement. We have delayed it for two years. It is bone against bone both doctors agree with the xrays and his low tolerance for pain meds. We have taken steroid injections every 3 months and he says they work. However his pain goes from hip to knee. We had everything scheduled and at the pre-testing they wanted to see him alone. Naturally he convinced them it was his knee not hip hurting. Now orthopedics'  surgeon want primary to agree he is sane enough for surgery. This has been musical chairs for the last 6 months. I am hoping the surgery will relieve some of his pain and allow him to relax more. Has anyone had any regrets or positive results after surgery?

Yesterday the med tech found her on the floor flat on her bottom. They called me immediately and requested that she be sent to the ER for X-rays. I had been at the hospital with my dad.     I got to her MC place and she had awful pain trying to get out of her recliner chair and couldn't put weight on her leg. So I had to have a private ambulance pick her up and transfer to the hospital. I was afraid to try to load her into my husbands car for fear that her back was hurt. She has degenerative disc disease.      Got to the ER--was told an hour wait time---3 hours later I am voicing concern because her Ativan was wearing off---she wasn't patient etc.. So they did back Xrays and luckily nothing showed up but while we were waiting she kept touching her left side of her abdomen. Finally saw the ER doc and he then decides to xray her ribs. So we have to wait more and I went back with her since she has ALZ and I knew the tech couldn't do her by herself. I had to stay in there with her while wearing just the apron &amp; instead of having mom stand for the xrays the tech had her sit on a rolling stool. Well we got through the xrays and then she slipped off the stool! Ribs were okay on xray. Doc dismissed us at midnight. We were there 7 hours!!      I went over today and she had been to breakfast but then when she tried to get out of her chair she couldn't do it. I had to get help. Then she went to bed for about 2 hours to stretch out. She still has pain in the abdomen and it hurts if she moves. I took her to the restroom---- yes I did all the caretaking today at the facility I pay for help! While she was on the toilet and I couldn't get her up I pulled the emergency  cord and waited and waited. Finally she got strength to get up and I got her back to the chair. I went to ask why no one came and I found out that the pull cords do not alert the MC staff!!!!! I am totally furious about that. My parents have been there 2 months and no one ever told me that! How the heck are MC people supposed to get help?? We both could have been on the floor in trouble.      Vent over.... but is this something I am going to have to get used to now?      Mom has declined so much since my dad has been in the hospital. She has baby dolls now that she sleeps with and loves on. Dad wouldn't approve but I can see it gives her enjoyment.      Mom's life is forever changed because I don't think that dad will ever be able to be with her again.

She has some battlescars but no serious damage and is not complaining of pain. So the pads are effective but I'd rather they be more like a mattress (better able to absorb impact).     My frustration centers not on the ""non-restraint"" policy (I understand their hands are tied) but rather on their lack of effort to suggest alternative measures. They did bring a ""perimeter"" mattress but my mom was easily able to swing her legs over the tapered raised edges.  Why I had to plead for a bed alarm I'll never understand but I've also been pleading for her meds to be adjusted to get better control over her night-time agitation for the past 8 days.      I read in one of Jo C.'s posts about limits on ""chemical restraints."" Could they be holding back on sedating her for that reason?

This is not to say that we should allow someone to keep walking all over us or that we should be doormats or passively allow others to do as  they please no matter the consequences to us.    Instead we should take ourselves out of any position for that person to hurt us again -- and we should go on with our lives without that person. It means we can take responsibility for our actions and refuse to lower our standards to someone else's level. It means we can choose to not allow others to use us or abuse us and hold our heads up knowing that we are doing our best to do what's right no matter the obstacles in our way.  Not easy I know.

I begged her to stop as evident mom was in pain and all she said was ""It doesn't bother my back.""    I was thinking  ""It's not YOU I'm worried about.""   That night when I put mom in her lift chair to sleep she was in the most incredible pain I have ever seen her in...Crying screaming begging to die.   She is never like that..she has a very high threshold..  Oh and did I mention this gal was 4'10 and mom is 5'10.   They almost both toppled over.   I called the agency that night and went off....told them never to come back.   The nurse called me the next morning and told me they would fix things.      The other girl I let go because she didn't show the first night (office claimed confusion in scheduling) and she had zero personality didn't interact with mom and basically was a zombie...Told me that she had been working 18 hour days and the agency would schedule her til midnight and then at 6 am...she has a full time job too.   I was going to give her another try but then she had a ""family emergency"" and they had to send a replacement....this was a good opportunity to ask that she never come back as it was apparent she was suffering from complete burnout.      Now we are in a rotation with 2 older women I love and who go the extra mile and one girl late 20s maybe  who for whatever reason refuses to take mom to the bathroom ..she sets up the commode in the middle of the family room.  I have no idea why she does this...She doesn't come often...1-2x a week so I am afraid to complain as she is super defensive and she almost quit one time before when I simply asked her if she needed some help with transfer of mom. But she NEVER does anything extra.  Doesn't even wash the dishes mom uses at breakfast.  Today she didn't wake me up before she left and the bathroom mess she left was inexcusable.   Somehow there was bm  on the toilet and on the bathroom faucet.   The toilet wasn't flushed.  She failed to put peanut butter on mom's toast which I know because she only ate half and the rest was left on the counter.   Most importantly she didn't wake me up when she left and left mom alone in a room with the walker in the same room.  I am lucky mom didn't try to get up and use it.     I'm ready to ask her to be replaced also but  I am scared I will get someone even worse. I don't necessarily want to be seen as a ""problem client"" but this is ridiculous. ..My back is killing me and not in the mood to break someone new in until after holidays (oh btw she is the one who I am sure got mom sick)     I have read how home health is the fastest growing least paid career out there. The turnover rate is extremely high  so I figure my case can't be isolated.  Have you all had problems getting a good standard of help?  Did it take you a few times to get the right person/combo?   I'm pretty easy going  and do a lot of their work for them by having everything set out and ready for them.  I know they are not all bad as the one gal even sets mom's hair and always works the full hour and 1/2 she is here.     I would love to find someone private for the morning but for only 1 hour-1.5 hours a day at 7 am  it is tough.   I do have a private person coming in later in the day a few times a week and is awesome...and she charges less than $15/hour.         Would love to hear some of your experiences.   Also do you tip them at the holidays?  I imagine one should/does but they have only been doing it for a little over a month and only one really deserves it.  The second one does but has only seen mom 3-4 times.     What amount is appropriate?",False,home again,2012-04-29,195.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511765,,,AlzConnected,,,

She had been ill with pneumonia and had recovered from being on a ventilator and was back at her nursing facility.     She was just certified for hospice and passed away the next day.     I was so upset to have not been with her. The staff said she passed quickly and was not in any pain. It happened quickly and she was already gone when the facility called me at work - wish I was there.     She was a beautiful person inside and out. Only 65 years old and has had early onset for about 10 years.      I don't post a lot but I have read and learned so much. Thank you all for your caring and information.      Our situation was unique as I was her guardian as her spouse did not care for her properly. It has been a rough few years in and out of the court systems. She is now at peace. What a horrible disease.

Recently my mom is seeing an orthopedic spine surgeon PA about possible spinal fusion. She called me yesterday saying that she is going to cancel her trip to Florida so that she can have surgery. My mom's pain medicine Tramadol ""works well"" according to her. What I have noticed is that when she has pain she does not know what to do. She just sits there quiet and hurting. This is why I think she is pursuing surgery. My mom thinks that a spinal fusion is going to take away her pain. Unfortunately spinal fusion is a very risky potentially dangerous procedure that is done as a last resort. So I called the doctors office. I spoke to a receptionist and I asked for a nurse. I don't think they have nurses. I tried to get a message to the PA. I wanted to let them know that my mom is struggling. She is has signs of dementia but she does not know it and she is not diagnosed. She does not know what to do when she is in pain. The receptionist told me that surgery is NOT recommended for my mom and I was relieved. The next day my mom went to the office and printed her record. They gave her a printout saying that her daughter says she has dementia. I am furious with this doctors office. I told them she does not have a diagnosis and she does not know. Why on earth would I know that when I call the information is being recorded for my mom to print out. I am not a doctor why would I be part of the medical record? I called the office manager and complained and she seemed to think that this was okay. What can I do? Do I have any sort of legal rights here? How are we supposed to call for help with our loved ones when the medical office staff undermines my credibility with my mom. My mom comes to me for advice. How is she supposed to trust me when she knows I talked to the office about what I'm concerned about. Now my mom has a paper that she can ask me about 10 more times. I am so mad and I want to complain more effectively. Any ideas?",False,LovePeg,2014-10-28,37.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511667,,,AlzConnected,,,

The neurologist told me and her husband (my dad). The problem is that my mother thinks she got a short term memory pill and an antidepressant. She called me yesterday to say that she is not going to continue to take the memory pill after this month because she heard they don't work anyway. Before my mom left the hospital I complained to the charge nurse that my mother did not know her diagnosis. What I am surprised by is that it did not get printed out in her discharge summary. I don't think my mother knows that she was in an angry rage in front of nurses doctors and family. We really need mom to take her medicines because we hope to see her calm and happy again. Mom has not had an outburst in 2 days and her pain is improved. How do we get mom to continue her treatment if she has no idea what she is being treated for? How does dad take over medications if mom thinks she is perfectly normal? I called the charge nurse and requested that my father get educated in mom's medications. I am not sure yet if that happened but from the sounds of it mom is still controlling her medicines. I begged the hospital to help and we are still in the same situation with mom doing her own medications. Why does someone leave the hospital without a diagnosis or community resources? It makes no sense. Family members are being left to figure out care on our own instead of utilizing resources. Why am I left doing my own research? It is just not right. I should not have to continually worry that my mom will accidentally overdose. If I go over with a locked pill box it will just be a fight.

Her thighs are not the problem it is the repetitive motion that she likes. The MC facility keeps her clean and moisturized. She is not in pain either. I have purchased infant fabric toys with tags and different textures for the stimulation. They work for a time but she always goes back to her thighs. I have gone through so many pairs of pants I can hardly keep up. My thought is possibly making some leg covers with velcro and sheepskin. Anyone have any ideas or experienced this?

So this doesn't sound good. He basically has shut down socially. He will attend many social outings with his wife (my loving step-mom) but he won't interact much. He is embarrassed. He can't buckle/snap/zip/tie his clothes.   I don't know why but I feel so guilty. We went for 2 years without seeing my dad and stepmom. My stepmom has been taking care of her mother in their home and she recently passed. They live 2 states away so we were finally able to see them. They visited me and my family and gave us the ""news."" I am an older mom of 44 years and have four boys all ages 6 and under. I am an only child.   I already apologized to my dad but I don't think he gets it nor does it concern him. He has always been my ""rock."" He could do anything and was always extremely dependable. I apologized to him for not spending enough quality time while he was here visiting. At the time I didn't know about the diagnoses and assumed his ""quietness"" was just him being irritated with our boys loud and rowdiness. He would just sit and be quiet appearing to observe. So at the time I didn't know what he was going through. He has always been a fun-loving father and so very funny. A bit absent minded already. So it didn't appear to me.   At this point I apologized to him but I can't seem to stop crying. They are so far away I really miss him. My stepmom will need some breaks from caregiving. But I am unable to really ""help"" because we're so far away. And I feel guilty for this too.      The pain of this disease came as quite a shock to me. Dad is only 63. I assume they have known about this a while now. I'm grateful they told me finally.      I worry he will forget me and his grandbabies. I worry he will forget his salvation. He continues to read his Bible and pray which I am extremely grateful for.      I asked them to consider moving closer to us but they are not interested. They know our kids still are growing up and we are raising them. Very unselfish people. I love them dearly.      How in the world do you cope with all of this? I cannot seem to stop crying.

January to June 204...  Endless Sleepless Days &amp; Nights Constant Eating Soiling Cleaning Worry and Pity. Sleeping Fully Clothed  24/7 and in the Living Room just to keep her from getting to the door.  Constant Packing and Unpacking her clothes.  Week of June 18 2014...  *  She is now having arguments with me about imaginary parties BBQ's and visitors.  She says we're supposed to be somewhere; but  it's not true.  We have no visitors; nor appointments.  *  She continues to upset me with her constant moving of her clothes into the truck when I'm taking a shower or otherwise using the  bathroom.  *  I had to buy 2/3 tires on the 16th.  They were beginning to shred due to the ruts out here; and were constantly leaking air.  I had no choice.  *  Today the Ignitions Switch on the steering column broke.  $50.00 for the tow $160.00 for parts and $60. for labor.  I got lucky !  *  More and more I'm ""Strobing""... where one minute my mind and thoughts are clear; but blank-out the very next minute.  I can't complete  tasks such as fill-out paperwork.  I've had so much of it for 2 or 3 months.  This is BAD !!!  *  We've both been wearing our clothes 24/7 because we're sleeping in the living room because I want to keep between her and the outside.  She continues to fall; but luckily hasn't gotten seriously hurt.  We both shower; but she has to change her clothes several times a day due to  her incontinence.  As for me... I see no reason to change all that often.  I have enough laundry just doing her clothes... as many as 24 sets per day in bad weather.  *  The doctor has doubled then tripled her Insulin Dosage.  Her Blood Sugar Level remains above 250 up to over 600.  Not Good !  *  I continue to hope for the Humilog and Levamir Pen companies to inform me that we're on their assistance program in which we may get the price of their Insulin Pens WAY Below $500.00 per month.  We'll never be able to continue her medication at the current prices; and Blue Cross isn't helping much at this time.  *  The Blue Cross people want her admitted into the hospital or nursing home for ""Skilled Care""; but the doctors haven't given her the  referral as yet.  They also continue to refuse her Brain Scan that the neurologist wants.  *  There appears to be a resurgence of that ""Chicken Pox"" disease I had over a year ago.  Believe it or not I can't even remember what it's called !  I'm itching constantly and terribly below my waist; but it's nowhere near as bad as it was last year.  Nevertheless I'm still not taking the pain medication (Lyrica and Gabapentin) for it because it causes me to be drowsy; and I can't take a chance that Tina will get out of the house or fall again.  She's fallen 2 or 3 times in the same room as me; but I couldn't hear her calling me because I was unconscious due to exhaustion.  *  I've asked Tina is she had any idea as to what things would be like if they do approve her move into a skilled Care facility or nursing home.  I don't believe she has any idea as to the implications; so I'll leave it alone for now.  *  It's 3:30 AM; and she is now cleaning-out her purse and putting on make-up for yet another attempt to load my truck with her clothes for a trip to nowhere.  I'll try and keep her from loading it all up again; but I'm falling asleep already.  It's been another long damned day.  *  'til Death Do !Us Part...  *  She is now using the phone to call people that she doesn't even know.  She is thinking about some party with imaningary people.  Life sucks  !  *  All day long I've been telling her that there is no one that is coming over for any reason whatsoever.  Nevertheless I still had to empty the truck of her clothes that she loaded between 4:00 am and 5:00 AM when I passed out.  Again Life Sucks; but ""'til Death Do Us Part !""  *  Now she is asking for the number of her former lover that took her away from me back in 1996.  In a way I wish He had the balls to take her.  *  June 20th...  I watched her nodding in her rocker as I cared for the BBQ I was working on.  Periodically she would wake-up to ask what month it was; and where several people were that she expected to visit.  I just told her that it was too early for them to come over.  She'd continue nodding-off with a spooky blank stare in her eyes whenever she'd wake again.  I couldn't help but feel sympathy for her; and for the thousandth time I'd look-up and ask God... ""Why ???"".    Again she has wet herself; but she can't tell.  I'm beginning to see a benefit to her if she does go to a nursing home.  At least they'd be able to keep her clean or medicated.  Regardless of how many times I tell her to shower and change her clothes she tells me that she isn't wet; so I have to point-out to her the problem.  Again I feel for her; and my concern for bed or pressure-sores looms in front of me.  So far so good.  With the increase in her bedtime Insulin dosage she is now sleeping deeply; but has awoken several times for coffee and something to eat eventhough she ate multiple steaks from today's BBQ.  She also ate 2 cans of fruit which I hope is good for her.  Now I'm just sitting here at 2:51 AM hoping to make it through the night.  Amen !  *  July 1st...  Tina begins having Serious Hallucinations and always between 1:30 to 3:30 AM.  So serious that she will argue with me when I tell her that there is no one there nothing happening nothing to worry about.  This becomes a nightly event stemming from some New Unknown causation.  *  July 24th...  Tina is finally in a nursing home.  Hacienda Oaks takes her in hoping that Medicaid will allow Retroactive Billing from the time that Tina turns 62 August 13th.  Although they initially wanted $2000. to $3000.00 up front they have taken her in at no cost to me... at least for the time being.  We have to Re-Qualify Every Week until Medicaid takes over... if they will.  *  July 27th...  I'm called in to the nursing home at 5:30 AM because they were worried about Tina getting excited over having to stay there.  Dr Chudleigh possibly went in too because the BCBS insurance has a charge of over $200.00 for this date !... SUNDAY  *  July 31st...  First week at the nursing home Tina wants to go home; and ask that I stay there with her.  She isn't accepting of the possibility that she may have to stay there indefinitely; and I won't tell her until I'm sure that Medicaid will allow it.  *  August 7th...  I have been asked to quit taking breakfast for Tina every morning because of concerns re her Blood Sugar Level.  Sad...  I still look at these little treats as her ""Last Meal"" !  *  August 7th...  A Grass Fire sweeps across the back-40 burns the trailer North of us and the acreage to our South.  No one hurt.  Comes within 50 feet of our house.  Fire company spent about 5 hours trying to put it out; and had to return about 10:30 PM for small fires still burning.  *  August 8th...  Tina is now apparently getting used to being in *the nursing home.  No longer asks me everyday when we're going home or asking me to stay with her the entire day.  This has happened in part because she is taken to Therapy every morning at 10:00 to 10:30 AM when I leave.  *  August 9th...  Having to deal with not visiting Tina today due to a broken pipe in the house that has to be fixed today... Saturday.  I'll call the nurses and ask them to let Tina know ONLY if Tins asks about my whereabouts.  It is my hope that she is to the point that her memory can forget my visit (or lack thereof) as she does everyone else.  Tough Call; but no choice for me.  *  August 10th...  Today is the first day I""ve noticed that Tina doesn't know whether I'm there with her or not.  This may be the blessing I've hoped for.  She may start depending more on the staff there in the nursing home than on me.  A kind of freedom in a way; but I still worry as to how she is doing; and how she is being treated.  Too many of the residents there appear to be just... existing... sitting or wandering aimlessly talking to themselves or shredding pieces of paper over and over.  Lonely and unloved or uncared-for.  No one deserves this.  *  August 13th...  Tina's Birthday.  Bought her some Estee Lauder Make-up and an Ice Cream Cake for her Ward Party.  *  August 14th...  Someone took away Tina's B'Day present; and I'm upset.  She was putting her nail polish on her eyes.  *  August 22nd...  The Nursing Home Administrator Gary Goodin assures me that he will insure Tina has blankets to keep warm now.  *  August 23rd...   No Blankets.  New roommate Ms. Lucky.  Energetic argumentative woman who was sharing a room with her husband; but they tended to argue too much; so for safety's sake they have moved her in with Tina.  Lucky Us !  Constantly F-this and F-that MotherF'rs etc.  *  August 25th...  Gary Goodin Again assures me that Tina will have blankets to keep her warm.  Ms. Lucky still upset about her move into Tina's room; and she called Gary Goodin down to the ward to complain.  He simply told her I was a visiting husband.  Huffing and Puffing and F-This.  *  August 26th...  No Blankets.  I sent him another email to this effect.  Lady from across the hall lays feces all over Tina's bathroom floor walls fixtures and cabinets.  *  August 29th...  Ms. Lucky took over Tina's Bed and blankets because Tina was doing her Nightwalks until 1:30 AM.  Ms. Lucky was confused; so Tina stayed cold another night !  *  September 4th...  After being absent from visiting Tina for 2 days for Monthly Bill Pay... Today she didn't even remember that I wasn't there.  It's as if it no longer matters if I visit or not.  My only purpose is to insure that she is being taken care of.  She doesn't seem to know if she is or isn't.  So Sad !  *  September 8th... I received a bill from BCBS for $10007.64 for SIX days of Service !!!  Yikes !!!  I called BCBS and they verified that the bill was justified; and that the nursing home could charge me $10007.64 EVERY SIX DAYS !!!  Okay... Deep Breath here... Calm Down !!!  I went to the nursing home and asked Billing for an itemization of that $10007.64.  Room Medications Therapy.  Damn... I need to work for them !!!  The Billing Manager also told me that she had just mailed-out the bill for August in the amount of $26000.00 !!!  CRAP !!!  I offer suggestions on how to trim down the bill.  Say... Therapy.  She says NO because BCBS would not pay if Therapy is cancelled.  *  September 9th... I call DADS in the hope of getting advice or help for that $10007.64 bill from the nursing home.  They assign an ombudsman to speak to the nursing home people and settle some complaints I have regarding Gnats &amp; Roaches in the room no blankets for Tina no water for Tina clothes missing 3 times lack of assistance for getting Tina to the bathroom unsanitary bathroom and Tina having to sleep in soiled clothes due to lack of supervision during toileting.  *  September 10th...  I visit again after speaking to the DADS Ombudsman Jeannette Blankenship.  I suggest pulling Tina out of the nursing home to halt additional charges.  BCBS and the nursing home advise me not to do this.  It won't help anyone.  They will set-up a payment plan in the event that Medicaid denies our application; and BCBS ceases to pay.  Damn... I could have bought a Mercedes on that kind of payment plan !!!  *  September 10th... I now owe the nursing home at least $36000.00 and it continues to accumulate at the rate of $10007.64 every SIX Days.  There is NO WAY I could pay this upon entry into the nursing home; and it's highly unlikely that I'll EVER be able to pay this exorbitant amount.  The current total calculated dollar amount is already twice my Total Annual Income !  They don't even serve Champagne and Caviar there !!!  *  September 11th...  Received a notification from Medicaid/HHSC that they have received our application as of 9/5/14; and they request 2 forms...  3618 and 3652.  Christina White says they've already been submitted.  Contact#  210.475.4597.  *  September 17th...  Received a call from Tracey Morin telling me that Tina will be taken off ""Skilled Care"" this Saturday 9/20/14.  No more therapy.  Lisa Jones PT says that Tina will continue to have ""Restorative Therapy"".  *  September 23rd...  Received a all from Michelle telling me that Tina's Speech Therapy has been DC (Discontinued).  *  September 25th...  Care Plan Meeting held at 1430.  No important info to be discussed.  Asked about Podiatrist and told he didn't come due to other appointments.  Joyce would check and let me know of next availability.  *  September 30th...  Rcv'd letter from Christina White.  It's a bill for $1596.76...

Well The Purple Haze of Unconsciousness had just fallen over me when the phrase…  “Wallowing In Self-Pity” crossed my mind.       All morning ever since talking with the administrator of the nursing home I had been mulling over what was said.  I was left with this feeling that they consider ME the Bad Guy.  I’m the one who is Intrusive Bothersome and just plain A Royal Pain In Their Collective Asses.       I actually felt a burst of Anger well-up inside of me !       For pretty near 40 years I’ve been working with near Perfect Attendance at every job… every overtime hour every holiday and many Many Weekends to take care of this family…. To make a home.  Because of some Damned Rotten and Ill-Timed Health Issue all of it is continually spiraling down into the toilet.       I know there are hoards of people in the same boat as I find myself now; but Man I Honestly Believe I Tried Hard !    There is less and less to hold onto; and more and more people trying to pry my hands off of what is left.  This Really Sucks Old Buddy !!!       I’ve convinced myself that No… I’m not really “Wallowing In Self-Pity”; but maybe I just need someone else’s perspective.  Tell me the truth; and give me your honest opinion.   This depression just keeps rearing its ugly head more and more frequently; and I don’t like it.  Hell…  even my insane sense of humor is now Shot Full of Holes.  Grim thoughts and worry just seem to continually seep through and get past it.  No more whistling comes from me; and as far as  ‘Rejoicing” goes…  I don’t really see it happening anytime soon.       As I walked through Walmart this morning I watched All These Old Folks as they bought a handful of the Bare Essentials for a day’s meal.  Hunched-Over as they pushed their empty carts I felt sorry for them until I realized that I was doing pretty much the same thing.  Damnit… 40 years of putting-up with Birdbrains and Assholes; and just for this !  I could have just become a drunk spent my life in jail with free meals and a cot and not give a damn about anything !  Ahh well… Methinks I Speaketh too much.       All this and near the back of my mind I worry about Tina.  Hey Look… A Squirrel !!!       *  December 3 2014...  Secondary Day Shift Nurse ""Kaylin"" called me on the cell phone about 9:30 AM.  She said that there had been an ""Incident"" in which the Ward Priest had been found in bed with Tina.  Both clothed; but nevertheless in bed together.   I don't believe there was any ""Ill Attempt"" carried-out here.  Tina was always asking to lay in bed with her.  I think it was just an ""Act of Kindness"" on the Priest's part.  He may have felt ""Compassion"" for Tina's Loneliness.     I'm undecided as to whether or not I should ""Make a Fuss"" over this single incident.  The nursing home is still awaiting a decision from Medicaid as to whether or not Tina's Application will be approved.  It's been 4 months already and they have been giving us a ""Free Ride"" so far.  In the event that I Make Trouble for them they may kick Tina out; and I don't want her back here during this time of year.  She suffered SO Badly last year in the cold.  May God Help Us !         *  December",False,edv7028,2013-09-16,277.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511408,,,AlzConnected,,,

Started at .5mg and it was increased by .25 in the morning last Saturday.  I have no idea if taking more would be better or if it's time to move on but discussed this with the Physician's Assist who works w Mom's geri psychiatrist and he said he would run that by him along with trying Zyprexa. He felt that might be better to try as it can also help with appetite. Indeed mom did gain weight when she was on it 4 years ago.      At any rate I'm starting to feel discouraged as my mother is so sensitive to meds and her dementia and psych issues so complex that I'm not sure the right combination and amounts of things can be found. This is her 7th hospitalization since 2005 though the first time she was high functioning and it was just an eval with no treatment recommended. Seroquel was terrible for her she had two good years on Abilify though at 5mg her symptoms returned this past October and increasing it to 7.5 and then 10 mg didn't help.      I know there are other meds like a new one Latuda and I'd consider Abilify again with different dosing or perhaps injections but in case nothing works I just want to prepare myself for what to do.  Her behaviors include auditory hallucinations delusions poor appetite refusing meds sometimes though fortunately she seems to take them in the morning and evening when the big guns are given.  She also resists care pinches people yells etc. I worry she won't be able to come back to her nursing home in this state.  Right now she has a private room in the nursing home on the medical unit though many have dementia and are very compromised. They also have a locked unit but no private rooms. That would be  like moving to a new place with new aides and nurses though the administration does know my mom and love who my mom has been. I worry a shared space would really agitate her given her paranoid tendencies.        If I was to put her on hospice would that make it more likely for them to take her if the behaviors don't resolve?      I'm running out of stamina to deal with this again. Abliify was like a magic bullet for her and though Zyprexa was successful for years she hasn't been on it since 2010 and a lot of things can change. I also worry that it was a mistake to switch her from Lexapro to Zoloft but I can't tell if that has much affect.       I also wonder if I should have sent her to the large university based geri psych unit in the city instead of this facility. I do appreciate how accessible the doctor's Phyician's assistant is but they have limited med choices and I haven't talked to the doctor yet. I could push for that but haven't so far.I guess that could be my plan B....       I'm also getting tired of people wandering continually into my mother's room- it's right next to the front desk. I don't think it bothers mom so much as it bothers me when I'm trying to talk or feed my mom the interruptions are such a pain. I haven't spoken to tanyone about that but I wonder if they are a bit short staffed. The nurses have them sit near the front desk when they are doing their paper work but these people still wander.

(She doesn't do it watching TV).  For example we sit down to dinner and as she's picking up her utensils and looking at the food on her plate whispering ""ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok"" and then if there's a piece of meat (she cuts her meat into little pieces before eating it) she starts with ""gotta cut that gotta cut that gotta cut that gotta cut that gotta cut that gotta cut that gotta cut that"".  If she's buttering her bread it's ""like that like that like that like that like that like that like that like that"" as she's applying the butter.      I have to say it's a little maddening.  On the other hand sometimes I find out things that she's not telling me like this weekend when as she stood up she started whispering ""oh my back oh my back oh my back oh my back"" so I asked her ""does your back hurt"" and she replied that yes sometimes her back hurt.  I had to get more specific ""is your back hurting you right now?""  and she answered yes so I gave her an Aleve which seemed to help.  She probably wouldn't have ever told me her back was hurting or asked for anything for the pain if I hadn't asked prompted by her whispering so I guess it can be a blessing in disguise.      Is this common?  Does anyone else have any experience with this?  I doubt there's anything I can do about it except get used to it.",False,Julzology,2013-08-07,6.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511182,,,AlzConnected,,,

Right now I'm worried about her Lexapro.           Mom's Lexapro 5 mg dose was moved from am to noon at my request to minimize  potential  interactions with several am meds that include Depakote.  The past few days in the hospital I've gotten there and noticed that after getting this medication at lunch mom is drowsy and has little moments of paranoid delusions but they typically don't last.  The hospital nurses told me that in the morning she's been great bright eyed clear and pleasant. The only other thing mom gets at noon is Tylenol.  Today when I came to the hospital for her discharge at 2pm she was taking a nap- completely sound asleep- zonked.  First time that has happened. She slept for 2 hours starting at 1:30pm.   I woke her up about 20 min before the ambulance was supposed to be there to give her time to wake up get to the bathroom etc.  Well boy oh boy. She was SO OFF- delusional mixed upparanoid.  It really scared me. She was also very groggy. This went on for about 15-20 minutes.  Then the ambulance came and that made it more confusing for her. She also got her Zyprexa about an hour or so early at the hospital it was close to 4pm.  So there were several things that were not the norm going on but it still really rattled me. Some of the odd behavior continued when we got to the nursing home while she was in her bed. Not paranoia but just real confusion and grogginess also some pain in her foot. After the nurse was done checking her and doing vitals I asked for some help to get her out of bed to the dining room for dinner to help get her oriented.  That seemed to help.  Though still tired she fed herself and ate well. She was a little more mixed up after we left but okay. In the hospital as she was recovering she was always very alert and clear at dinner (but her Zyprexa was increased on Tuesday so not sure if that will continue...).           I think my nerves are just so darn frayed from having gone through this almost 3 week hospitalization plus the 3 weeks of hallucinations and paranoia prior to that. It's so stressful trying to balance giving the meds time to adjust in her body and also be vigilant about noticing things that could be an issue with the meds. It's a hard line to walk and figure out. Especially since her dementia is likely a little worse.             So in the meantime as I tread water in this very uncomfortable place I wanted to ask if any of you have had a LO on Lexapro and have ever noticed confusion or odd behaviors from it?   Mom's been on 5 mg for 2 years. This is the first time I ever thought to think it could be a problem.           Or have you take your LO off Lexapro?  Did you taper it? Were there any withdrawal side effects?   Was their dose 5mg or higher?  These are questions I can ask her psychiatrist about  but it really helps to hear from others to give me perspective.            Anyone have a LO taking Zyprexa 5mg or higher?  Have they noticed any increased confusion/fatigue while on this med?  I know in the past several years ago mom took it at bedtime and it helped her sleep. The physician's assistant I worked with scheduled mom's dose for dinner time as he said it can cause a ""hangover effect"" in the morning. So far I think that has worked well .Mom has been able to sleep well and it hasn't sedated her at dinner. She's been very clear and alert in the mornings.  Though I worry of course if that will last as they had bumped up her dose from 2.5 mg to 5 mg ( 5 started on Tuesday). Will it make her more sedated?          Anyways any info on these meds would be very helpful.  Some people think once you get out of the hospital everything will be suddenly fine and that really isn't the case.  I have always found ""re-entry"" back from the hospital especially a geri psych unit to be difficult.  Not only am I helping mom get back in the swing of things but I'm always worrying if the meds will ""work"" or perhaps lead to yet another problem.  And I can't quit as a caregiver as I'm it. My brother lives in LA and there's no other family. I think this is the 13th hospitalization since 2010. ( Some medical too).

I muted her tv held her face in my hands and said ""So little one.  I hear Mom and Dad come and visit you every day.""  She shook her head yes.  I asked her if they wanted her to go to heaven and she again shook her head yes.  I then tried once again to explain to her how beautiful heaven would be.  She wouldn't need her feeding tube she wouldn't have to worry about choking there'd be no pain and no one ever gets sick.  I went on to say ""I've never seen heaven Deb but I've read about it.""  She then held onto my face cried and said ""I've seen it.""  I almost fell off the side of the bed!  She then cried and cried telling me that she loved me.  I mustered up all the strength I could find held her and told her once again ""It's okay to go there.  Mom and Dad are waiting for you.  I'll be there some time soon and so will Bob (my husband).  I've always loved you Deb and will always be with you.  When you go to heaven I'll be there too before you know it.  You are strong and you are my hero.  Don't be afraid.""     She cried for a bit more holding on to me.  Then as her mind so easily does she was diverted back to the tv.  I stayed a while longer before leaving.  She blew me kisses as she always does and smiled weakly.     I told her nurses.  Her one nurse said the other day she had a conversation with Dad right in front of the nurse.  The nurse had no doubt Dad was in that room.  She told him ""No Dad. Maybe tonight.""  That alarmed the nurse so when they did shift change at 7:00 PM she told the night nurse to watch her closely.  She may be passing that night.  Well that was a couple of days ago.  She's still here.      My mom saw heaven the night before she died and told me that she had seen my babies there (I had 3 miscarriages).  Mom had no Dementia but died from a massive stroke.  Now Deb has seen heaven - and recently.  We decorated her room on Saturday night for Christmas and she didn't get nearly as excited as she usually does.  I wish I had some kind of clue as to how much longer we have with her as she continues to weaken - and now told me that she has seen heaven.",False,Pam14,2014-05-30,555.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511378,,,AlzConnected,,,

Then I had to re-document every reason I've been out (including a vacation and an URI last week). Then my boss and all the bosses up to the director had to have a meeting to discuss this.  This today two days before I was about to return to the office since I can now walk all day without too much pain.  And we have at least 6 employees on our staff that work from home full time so what's the big deal?        According to my manager I'm OK (although I have a hard time believing something would get to that level if everything was fine).  She is willing to modify my telework agreement to allow me to work from home full time if needed.  But I have spent the entire day upset and stressed out.  I guess I'm venting here because I am a caregiver x2.  I have enough stress in my life already without someone stirring something up and potentially trying to impact my career. I'm just going to assume the trouble maker has never had any issues to deal with in their lives and that is why they lack empathy for anyone else.        Has anyone else here had to deal with issues not from your m anager but your co-workers as a result of being ill or a caregiver?,False,rosepoint,2014-01-22,573.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511562,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have been giving her Mucinex which really has helped calm the cough.      I don't have enough experience with different viruses/infections/etc.   I just assumed if she had pneumonia or anything else we would have her treated accordingly.  However I have been reading recently that some choose not to treat such conditions for late stage Alz patients.Apparently the antibiotics can cause more stress and pain than non treatment which could I assume result in death.   Mom has for years expressed her desire to die.  She prays for it nightly.  We always had hoped that she would pass before the horrors of the end stages (as we all do.)       I guess I want to be prepared for the dr appointment Wed if indeed I am told she has pneumonia.   I am thinking they might offer to hospitalize her and treat her..and if so I assume this decision would be up to the family.        Has anyone chosen not to treat pneumonia in their LO?   Part of me wonders if I should even take her in.   She has been thru so much in the last month. I read an old post where poster's LO doctor told her the best thing to hope for was for her to get pneumonia and to not take her to the hospital.   She was upset about the statement but her LO was much younger  and situation was entirely different.  Our hope was keep mom at home until hospice was necessary.  She is 89 and other than the AD and this new thing in fairly good health.    Would we be hospice eligible if we decline a/b treatment?",False,home again,2012-04-29,195.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511643,,,AlzConnected,,,

972,62107e6e7b65de9a5b67069e,2147511353,2014-12-03 02:09:00,Update on Dad(3),"It has been a very steep decline for him since August. I had to move my dad in with me he just couldn't be in his house any longer. He fell going up the stairs (thank god it wasn't down) and couldn't do even super basic tasks like brush his teeth or press a single big button on the TV remote (to turn it on or off).     In the last few months he has gone from being able to get around with a cane to needing a walker full time. The foot neuropathy is much worse. He has lost a lot of his pain perception. He cannot have a bowel movement without help and it scares him. He is going through a phase where he thinks it's time to eat all the time even 5 minutes after a bigger meal like dinner.      In the last 45 days he has begun to try to escape his surroundings and then started to mess with/disrupt his indwelling foley catheter. I had to put up baby gates first with child safety locks then actual padlocks as he figured out how to defeat the child-safety locks. These keep him from areas he shouldn't get to (laundry room/etc).     He wakes in the night detaches the overnight urine drain bag and lets the catheter just drain into the bed on the floor for hours.  Or he will scratch until he bleeds and keep at it.     I had to spend ~$8000 to make house modifications to my house (cut in a paved driveway around the house to the basement make adjustments to the room/bathroom/etc).      He now constantly gets up all day and paces non-stop which we let him do as that functions as exercise for him to help with circulation/etc.     In the last month or so he is now really struggling to stand up from a sofa or chair but we let him work at it until he can get up to keep his muscles/etc active.     At night a few times now he has tried to actually rip the catheter tubing. He wraps the tube around his hands gets his knee between them and violently tries to tear it. The last time all he managed to do was detach the overnight bag and then drain urine all over everything for hours. That was until the past Saturday after thanksgiving November 29th.      After being up for almost 72 hours watching him on the monitors at night working with him during the day I finally succumbed to sleep deprivation and passed out at 5am on Saturday the 29th.      By 5:45 am he had ripped the indwelling foley catheter from his body and was laying in a pool of urine in the bed with the carpet around the bed entirely soaked.      We took him to the Veterans Hospital ER not knowing if he was bleeding internally/etc. They got us back in a few minutes assessed him and re-catheterized him. he had no concept of anything he had done with the only comment being ""did I get up too early?""     That day was the hardest of any so far. It was well terrible. Waking up from only about an hour of sleep in several days to finding that.      I later watched the DVR (I have night vision cameras in his living area) and saw him invert the bag and let it pour out through the catheter on the floor.     The only reason he didn't seriously harm himself  was because he had ripped off the inflating tube from the catheter and it had deflated inside him simply sliding out when he yanked on it.     We had previously tried sleep medications some work for a single night then not again just a few days later. The doctor prescribed myrtazipine? and that works for a night then not again a few days later.     I have not gotten any kind of quality sleep for more than a couple hours or at max 4 at a stretch in almost 4 months and it is taking its' toll.  I have serious pain in the nerves in my head and neck. I've had many bouts where it is hard to stay awake at work during the day no matter how much coffee I've had.      The V.A authorized a few hours of paying for a home health aide to come in and take care of some of his ADL's. 3 hours a day 4 days a week. So I augmented that with another hour a day and then 4 hours on Saturdays by self-paying.      This goes from 11am to 3pm. The health aide bathes him helps him with bowel movement (which is pretty consistent) feeds him lunch and engages him with basic activities.     This schedule flip/flop combined with him actively trying to tear out the catheter at night is well...It's draining.     This combined with the utter lack of programs/aide to help is eye-opening saddening and bewildering all at once.     We're not rich we can't pay the 6-9k/month a facility that can handle him charges that's insane.      If we try the Medicaid route (Virginia is not doing Medicaid expansion anyway) they will re-possess the only thing he has his house and honestly? I don't want to have to fall back on this same broken system when my time comes so that is a minor investment to use to help set us up to not be in such bad shape.     Aside from that after touring so many facilities and working with around 9 home health aides that also work in facilities...the stories they tell...Just wow. Places are understaffed overworked underpaid and because of that they have no choice but to visit folks less frequently and that could mean lying in a bed full of urine/feces for a couple hours. Sure there are ""good"" places out there but what if that ""good"" place has a few bad staff. It's no better than here with me where he is clean safe well-fed engaged and comfortable.     I bought a bed pressure sensor/alarm that plays a recorded message when he tries to get out of bed. That mostly worked for a month then he figured out he could lay down and tear at the catheter OR he could get up and ignore it.     Also he can no longer understand the voice coming ""from the box"" is me. ""That guy in the box no one believes me  but I don't like him! he tells me to get back into bed!"".     To prevent him from doing this at night because I simply can't stay awake 24/7 (I've done that as best I could for the last 3 months) I am going to be trying some devices such as the posey finger control mitts that prevent him from grabbing things.     If those don't work I'll be looking at some padded restraints to use for a few hours a night to prevent him from getting at the catheter so I can get some sleep any sleep.        This phase is horrible. It is now taking a toll on my health my ability to focus at work it's terrible for him it's eating through finances at a break-neck pace and I have come to understand : There is no cavalry coming there is no rescue anything that happens will be entirely my own making or effort.",False,OneDay,2014-07-18,147.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147511353,,,AlzConnected,,,
973,62107eba7b65de9a5b670803,2147511511,2014-12-09 18:19:00,5 Things dementia caregivers should know to make their jobs a little easier,"I've been away from the forum for a while and have to admit I miss interacting with all of you. I'm a retired dementia care nurse but I still enjoy helping a little whenever I can. To that end I would like to share with you 5 of the things people with dementia (and their families) have taught me over the years that you might find helpful. Every time I learned something new from them my job became a little easier hopefully this information can help make yours a little easier too.  Many of you already know some of this.     First I learned early on that people with dementia are just like you and me in many ways. They have many of the same needs. Food water need to toilet need for sleep and a quiet place to retreat to when things cause upsets or get too stimulating .       We all can feel the same emotions: Frustration anger happiness anxiety boredom depression hatred embarrassment to name a few. People with dementia also have the same physical feelings we may have. Headaches arthritis pain itchiness heart palpitations stomach aches etc.        The point being that you can say something or do something about  your  needs. People with dementia cannot. It is up to us as care givers to try to put ourselves in the place of the person with dementia to figure out what they need  right then and there  to solve a problem or help them feel better. Doing this can avoid ""problematic behaviors"".  For instance when agitation occurs consider all of the above to find the reason why. This usually works.     Second: Just like us people with dementia pick up on the emotions of others. If we as caregivers are rushed angry depressed etc. it will affect the way the person with dementia reacts to us. Be mindful of your body language and facial expression when you approach and communicate with your LO. Learn and use good communication skills. Doing this will help more than you can imagine.      Third We need to remember that dementia affects cognition not just memory loss. This means that if we say no to or argue a point with someone who has dementia they cannot understand it. For instance Rather than saying ""no you cannot go outside now"" (which the person probably won't agree with and try anyway) use distraction. Anything interesting to your LO can be used.  Arguing is useless. The person with dementia lacks the cognitive ability to see your side. They will become frustrated and the situation will escalate.     Fourth Think about the ""reality"" of the person with dementia. Are they living in the past? Perhaps they are misinterpreting their environment and hearing or seeing things that you don't. Does the person believe you are someone else or maybe looking for a LO who is deceased?       We cannot force reality on people with dementia. This will only upset frustrate and anger them. Putting ourselves in their situation might help. Do they believe they have to go to work or find a missing child?  Using ""white lies"" and/or distractions can help avoid negative situations. Ex. ""Dad today is Saturday you don't work today""  or ""Mom your daughter is at school. We'll get her later""     Fifth       Humor is the care giver's best friend. Over the years I have laughed at jokes my patient's told me (which I did not understand) and I have been the brunt of some of their antics as well. (While bending over a med cart a resident yelled out ""biggest butt I ever saw"" and when I turned around held out her arms for a hug.         We shared humorous moments laughing together at a variety of things but I learned quickly that one of the most hurtful things anyone can do is to laugh AT not WITH a person who has dementia. Humor is a valuable tool and we should use it wisely. It can increase the quality of life for both the person with dementia and the caregiver.     These are some of the things my residents taught me over the years. Some of the posts I read here are about situations which occur partly because the caregiver may not have understood what the person with dementia had to teach them.  I hope these insights help.

974,62107eeb7b65de9a5b6708ec,2147511091,2014-11-21 19:05:00,Help!  I think my parents are in denial and I suspect my dad still hasn't insisted that my mom stop driving.,It has recentlybeen confirmed that my mom has Alzheimer's.  We've ( as her daughterand son in law) had an inkling the past two years that something wasvery wrong and we tried to encourage her to go to the doctor.  My daddidn't want to be overbearing and “treat her like a baby”.  Mymom kept insisting that “doesn't everyone have problems rememberingthings”?  She's been tripping and falling quite a lot this pastyear. Finally after yet another fall and trip to the ER the nursesfound out that my mom hadn't been taking a large amount of hermedication.  This raised a red flag for them and she was admitted tothe hospital for five days for testing at the end of which it wasconfirmed she had Alzheimer's.  Now they want to keep this a secretso that Mom's not “embarrassed” by rumors.  I think this idea isabout as logically sound as expecting that you can hold back atsunami with your bare hands.  I wasn't even supposed to tell my stepbrother.  He and my sister in law were rightfully worried and wantedto know what was wrong her. I finally decided I had to tell mybrother.  To tell one of us and not the other is grossly unfair. Evenif she isn't his mother she's like a mother to him.  And my parentsare always telling me stuff but not him.  He says he doesn't care butI know it really wounds him.  Anyway now my mom is back at home.  Shestayed in bed for the better part of a week because she said she wasqueasy.  I think she was/is also having a hard time with thediagnosis.  She talked about it once with me kind of dancing aroundthe subject saying she'll try not to be a “pain in the neck” tous.  My heart hurt for her and I reassured her she was never a painin the neck to us.  She said thank you and she needed to hear that. Now she won't take her Alzheimer's meds for my dad and she won't talkabout what's going on.  I saw her hands really shaking the other dayand she refused to tell me why.  Yesterday I called her to check inon her and she said just a minute she needed to let the dogs out  Inless than thirty seconds she forgot I was on the line.  I hung up andtried to call again every fifteen minutes until my dad answered a fewhours later.  He said she was fine and that she was getting ready togo out.  My fear is that he's still not addressed the driving issuewith her.  How on God's green earth can she drive when she can'tremember a thing from second to second??  I want to say something butdad said not to bring it up to her.  I want to stay out of theirbusiness but I'm terrified for the safety of her and others.

975,62107eef7b65de9a5b670901,2147511012,2014-11-18 00:32:00,Nursing home Federal Regulations that skilled nursing must adhere to,"Nursing Home Care Standards   The end notes (a number at the end of a statement) refer to the regulation that is there to protect a resident  Facilities can be cited for faiing to ahere to federal regulations.  Note title 22 refers to California only CFR and USC are federal nationwide protections. There are regulations for catheters and feeding tubes also but I omitted them.    Overview  In exchange for Medicare and Medi–Cal payments certified nursing homes agree to give each resident the best possible care. Specifically they are required to help each resident attain or maintain the highest practicable physical mental and psychosocial well–being. 1  Unless it is medically unavoidable nursing homes must ensure that a resident’s condition does not decline. 2 Care treatment and therapies must be used to maintain and improve health to the extent possible 3  subject to the resident’s right to choose and refuse services. 4    Beyond these broad requirements federal and California laws set many specific care standards. Key requirements are described below. Some of the care standards only apply to nursing homes that participate in the Medicare and Medi–Cal programs. Most California nursing homes participate in at least one of these programs.  Care standards are government expectations; however they don’t guarantee quality. If you are not receiving proper care contact the long term care ombudsman program or CANHR for advice or file a formal complaint with the California Department of Public Health.   Each section includes endnotes that identify the laws and regulations explained in this guide. Key laws are abbreviated as follows: Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations as ""22 CCR"" Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations as ""42 CFR"" and Title 42 of the United States Code as ""42 USC."" For example the citation in this section’s first endnote ""42 USC §1396r(b)(2)"" refers to Title 42 of the United States Code at section 1396r subsection (b) paragraph (2). The abbreviation CMS stands for The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which is a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Accommodation of Needs  A resident has the right to reside and receive services in the facility with reasonable accommodations of individual needs and preferences. 5  The facility should attempt to adapt such things as schedules call systems staff assignments and room arrangements to accommodate residents’ preferences desires and unique needs. 6  For example if a resident refuses a bath because he or she prefers a shower prefers it at a different time of day or on a different day does not feel well that day is uneasy about the aide assigned to help or is worried about falling the staff should make the necessary adjustments realizing that the resident is not refusing to be clean but refusing the bath under the circumstances provided. 7    If language or communication barriers exist between residents and staff the nursing home is required to use interpreters or other measures to ensure adequate communication. 8    Adequate Staff  Nursing homes must have sufficient nursing and other employees to meet the needs of each resident in the nursing home at all times. 9  Additionally California requires skilled nursing facilities to provide a minimum of 3.2 hours of nursing care per resident per day. 10  If this staffing level is not adequate to meet resident needs the nursing home must employ as many licensed nursing and certified nursing assistants as are needed. In a clearly visible place a facility must post daily for each shift the current number of licensed and unlicensed nursing staff directly responsible for resident care. 11    Care Planning  Nursing homes must establish a comprehensive individualized care plan for each resident that spells out care needs and how they will be met.  Continence and Help with Toileting  Urinary incontinence the inability to control the bladder is one of the most common reasons people seek nursing home care. Over half of California nursing home residents are considered incontinent. Incontinence and lack of toileting assistance cause many serious problems including discomfort skin rashes pressure sores falls isolation and psychological harm. 12    Incontinence is not a normal part of aging and is often reversible. Many times it is due to medications or treatable health conditions. Each resident with bladder or bowel control problems must be promptly assessed and be provided treatments and care that can improve the condition. 13    Catheters cannot be used without valid medical justification. 14  Catheters cause discomfort limit mobility and increase the risk of infection bladder stones and cancer. 15  If a catheter is used the nursing home must provide appropriate treatment and services to prevent urinary tract infections and to restore as much normal bladder function as possible.  Many nursing home residents are not incontinent but do need help with toileting. For example a resident with limited mobility may need help to reach the toilet. Or a resident with dementia may need reminders to use the toilet on a regular basis. Nursing homes must help these residents use the toilet as often as needed. 16      Fluids and Hydration  Many nursing home residents become dehydrated because they are not given sufficient fluids. Symptoms of dehydration include dizziness confusion constipation fever decreased urine output and skin problems. Severe dehydration can lead to serious illness and death. 23    Nursing homes must provide each resident with sufficient fluids to maintain proper hydration and health. 24  Each resident should be provided a plentiful supply of fresh water or other beverages and be given any help or encouragement needed to drink.  Food and Nutrition  Nursing homes must provide each resident a nourishing palatable well–balanced diet that meets daily nutritional and special dietary needs. 25  Additionally nursing homes must:   Serve at least three meals daily at regular times with not more than a 14–hour span between the evening meal and breakfast; 26    Offer snacks at bedtime; 27    Reasonably accommodate resident food and mealtime preferences; 28    Offer a food substitute of similar nutritional value if a resident refuses food; 29    Serve food attractively at the proper temperature and in a form to meet individual needs; 30    Prepare and follow menus that meet national dietary standards; 31    Plan menus with consideration of the residents’ cultural backgrounds and food habits; 32    Post the current and following week’s menus for regular and special diets; 33    Prepare food using methods that conserve nutritive value flavor and appearance; 34    Provide therapeutic diets to residents with nutritional problems subject to physician orders; 35    Ensure that a resident’s ability to eat does not diminish unless it is medically unavoidable; 36    Provide individualized help to residents who need assistance with meals offering enough assistance and time so that residents can finish meals; 37    Provide special eating utensils to residents who need them; 38    Provide table service to all residents who desire it served at tables of appropriate height; 39    Store prepare distribute and serve food under sanitary conditions. 40     If a resident’s ability to eat is compromised the facility should establish an individualized care plan to maintain the resident’s ability to eat food orally. 41  For example therapeutic programs can be used to help improve a resident’s ability to swallow or to help a confused resident maintain a fixed eating routine. 42    Nursing homes must notify a resident’s physician immediately if there are signs of malnutrition such as a weight loss of 5 pounds or more within a 30 day period. 43  Federal guidelines urge nursing homes to reassess nutritional status whenever a resident experiences unplanned or undesired weight loss of 5 percent or more in one month 7.5 percent or more in three months or 10 percent or more in 6 months. 44    Infection Control  Nursing homes must have an organized infection control program that prevents diseases and infections from developing and spreading. 45  To meet this requirement at a minimum nursing homes must:   Investigate control and prevent infections in the facility;  Screen residents and employees for tuberculosis;  Decide what procedures should be applied to an individual resident;  Isolate residents only to the degree needed to isolate infecting organisms using the least restrictive method possible;  Require staff members to wash their hands after each direct contact with a resident; Medications     Most residents depend on medicine to treat illness and maintain their health. In order to ensure that medications are available and used safely federal and state rules require nursing homes and physicians to properly order record store administer and monitor medications. Despite the detailed standards medication problems such as over–prescribing drugs and medication errors are common.   Key medication requirements are summarized below:    Consent:  Residents and their legal representatives have the right to consent to or to refuse any treatment including use of medications. 51  Physicians must seek consent before ordering or changing medications.   Choice of Pharmacy:  Residents have the right to choose their own pharmacy subject to certain limitations. 52     Timely Availability:  Nursing homes must have 24–hour arrangements with one or more pharmacies to ensure that residents receive ordered medications on a timely basis. 53    A drug whether prescribed on a routine emergency or as needed basis must be provided in a timely manner. This requirement is not met if the late administration of a prescribed drug causes the resident discomfort or endangers his or her health and safety. 54  Doses shall be administered within one hour of the prescribed time unless otherwise indicated by the prescriber. 55     Unnecessary Drugs:  Over–prescribing medications is a dangerous but common problem in nursing homes. Federal law addresses this problem by prohibiting nursing homes from using unnecessary drugs. An unnecessary drug is any drug given: (1) in excessive dose; (2) for an excessive period of time; (3) without adequate monitoring; (4) without adequate justification; or (5) in the presence of adverse consequences which indicate the dose should be reduced or discontinued. 56     Restricted Drugs:  Federal regulations place special restrictions on the use of certain drugs. Sedatives tranquilizers and similar drugs can only be used if the medical need is clearly documented. 57  Federal guidelines discourage nursing homes from using a detailed list of drugs that have a high potential for severe adverse outcomes when used to treat older persons. 58    Residents cannot be given antipsychotic drugs unless they are necessary to treat a mental illness that has been diagnosed and documented in the resident’s clinical record. 59  If antipsychotic drugs are used the nursing home must try to discontinue them by using behavioral interventions and gradual dose reductions unless clinically contraindicated. 60    Drug use to treat behavior symptoms is highly restricted. Except in an emergency it is generally illegal to chemically restrain a resident which means to control a resident’s behavior through drug use when other forms of care and treatment would be more appropriate. 61  Nursing homes cannot sedate residents to cover–up behavioral symptoms caused by: (1) environmental conditions such as excessive heat noise and overcrowding; (2) psychosocial problems such as abuse taunting or ignoring a resident’s customary routine; or (3) treatable medical conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. 62  See CANHR’s Fact Sheet  Restraint Free Care  and  Toxic Medicine  for additional information on nursing home residents’ rights to be protected from chemical and physical restraints.   Who Can Administer:  Generally medications must be administered by licensed nurses or medical personnel. 63  Unlicensed staff may administer certain laxatives non–prescription lotions medicinal shampoos and baths subject to specific training demonstrated competence and direct supervision by licensed nursing or medical personnel. 64  The person who administers the drug or treatment must record the date time and dosage in the resident’s individual medication record. 65     Medication Errors:  Nursing homes must keep medication error rates under 5 percent and must ensure that residents are free of any significant medication errors. 66  A medication error is a discrepancy between the facility’s actions and either physician’s orders manufacturer’s specifications or accepted professional standards. 67  A medication error is considered significant when it causes the resident discomfort or jeopardizes his or her health and safety. 68     Ban on Sharing:  It is illegal to give a medication to someone other than the resident for whom it was prescribed. 69     Quality Control:  Each nursing home is required to obtain services from a licensed pharmacist to assess its medication system and to review the drug regimen of each resident on a monthly basis. 70  The pharmacist is required to report any irregularities to the resident’s attending physician the administrator and director of nursing who must act on the reports. 71    Personal Care  Nursing homes must give residents necessary assistance with bathing dressing eating and other personal needs. 72  Unless it is medically unavoidable the nursing home must ensure that residents’ abilities to carry out activities of daily living do not decline. 73  Activities of daily living include bathing dressing grooming eating walking communicating using the toilet and transferring to or from a bed or chair. 74    Many standards address personal care requirements. For example nursing homes must:   Provide care to maintain clean dry skin; 75    Change soiled linens clothing and other items so that residents’ skin is free from urine and feces; 76    Provide needed personal care services including bathing shampooing and grooming of hair oral hygiene shaving or beard trimming and cleaning and cutting of fingernails and toenails; 77    Ensure that residents are free of offensive odors; 78    Answer call signals promptly; 79    Ensure privacy during treatments and personal care. 80     Physician Services  Each resident’s care must be supervised by a physician selected by the resident or the resident’s representative. 81  A facility may not place barriers in the way of residents choosing their own physicians. For example if a resident does not have a physician or if the resident’s physician becomes unable or unwilling to continue providing care to the resident the facility must assist the resident in exercising his or her choice in finding another physician. 82    Physicians generally must see and evaluate residents at least every 30 days and more often if needed. 83  Face to face contact with residents is required as is review of the resident’s total program of care during required visits. 84  Total program of care means all care the facility provides including medical services medication management therapy nursing care nutritional interventions social work and activity services. 85    Attending physicians have a critical role in nursing home care. In theory doctors have tremendous power over nursing home care because they must authorize virtually all aspects of residents’ care and treatment. 86  A resident’s attending physician is expected to:   Participate in the resident’s assessment and care planning;  Monitor changes in the resident’s medical status;  Review the resident’s total program of care at each required visit;  Prescribe new therapy and treatments as needed:  Order a resident’s transfer to the hospital;  Supervise nurse practitioners or physician assistants if follow–up visits are delegated to them;  Provide consultation or treatment when called by the facility; and  Record the resident’s progress and problems in maintaining or improving their health status. 87     Nursing homes must carry out doctors’ orders and arrange all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic services recommended by the resident’s physician podiatrist dentist or clinical psychologist. 88  If the services cannot be brought into the facility the nursing home must help the resident arrange transportation to and from the service location. 89    Nursing homes are required to notify the resident’s attending physician promptly of: (1) a sudden or marked adverse change in signs symptoms or behavior; (2) an unusual occurrence involving the resident; (3) a change in weight of five pounds or more within a 30 day period; (4) an untoward response to a medication or treatment; (5) a life threatening medication or treatment error; or (6) a threat to the resident’s health or safety caused by the facility’s inability to timely obtain or administer prescribed drugs equipment supplies or services. 90    Nursing homes must have substitute doctors available to provide supervision and emergency medical care whenever residents’ physicians are unavailable. 91    Pressure Sores  People who lie or sit in one position for long periods are at risk of developing pressure sores also known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers. They occur when pressure on the skin shuts off blood vessels depriving skin tissue of oxygen and nutrients. If proper care is not given large deep sores can develop sometimes exposing the muscle or bone below the skin. Untreated pressure sores can lead to infection severe pain and death.  Generally pressure sores can be prevented with proper care. 92  Nursing homes must make sure that residents entering the facility do not develop pressure sores and that residents who have them are given treatment to promote healing and prevent infection. 93    To prevent pressure sores nursing homes must keep a resident’s skin clean and dry maintain good nutrition and keep pressure off of vulnerable parts of the body. 94  Pressure is relieved by changing the resident’s position as often as necessary and using pressure relieving devices such as pads and special mattresses. 95    A nursing home must notify the resident’s physician immediately if he or she develops a pressure sore and must follow the doctor’s treatment orders to clean and dress the wound. 96  It is critical to relieve pressure from the wound and ensure that the resident receives proper nutrition and hydration. If the treatment is not effective the nursing home must again notify the resident’s physician. 97    Preventing Accidents  Falls and accidents are a serious concern for nursing home residents. Approximately 50 percent of residents fall annually and 10 percent of these falls result in serious injury especially hip fractures. 98    Historically many nursing homes have physically restrained residents to prevent or limit falls. However restraints are unsafe and cause more injuries than they prevent. See CANHR’s Fact Sheet Restraint Free Care for information on laws restricting nursing home use of restraints.  Nursing homes must examine risk factors that cause falls and accidents and take these steps to limit the risks:   Keep the resident environment as free of accident hazards as possible;  Give each resident adequate supervision to prevent accidents; and  Use assistive devices that help improve resident safety. 99     If a resident has fallen or been injured or is considered at risk his or her care plan must individually address this concern and identify steps that will be taken to improve safety.  Special Services  Nursing homes must ensure that residents receive proper treatment and care for the following special services: (1) Injections; (2) IV fluids; (3) colostomy ureterostomy and ileostomy care; (4) tracheostomy care; (5) tracheal suctioning; (6) respiratory care; (7) foot care; and (  prostheses. 100  If residents need these services federal law requires that they be provided regardless of whether they are covered by Medicare or Medi–Cal. 101  For services not covered a nursing home is required to assist the resident in securing any available resources to obtain the needed services.   Therapies Restorative Care and Range of Motion    Therapy Services:  Nursing home residents often need specialized rehabilitative services to restore lost abilities caused by strokes broken bones and other conditions. The nursing home must provide needed therapy services no matter who is paying for the nursing home stay. 102 Federal law requires that a resident receive the therapy needed to reach his or her highest practicable level of functioning. 103  The nursing home must provide or arrange needed therapy services such as but not limited to physical therapy occupational therapy speech–language pathology and mental health rehabilitative services. 104    Formal therapy services require a doctor’s order 105  and an evaluation by a licensed therapist. Once the assessment for therapy services is completed a care plan must be developed followed and monitored by a licensed professional. 106    Subject to various conditions and limits Medicare pays for skilled rehabilitation services received in a skilled nursing facility. Coverage for these services is sometimes improperly cut short by facility decisions that a resident is not improving or has reached a plateau. This is not a legal reason for stopping therapy services. Medicare rules say that improvement is not necessary – therapy services can be covered if needed to prevent further deterioration or preserve current capabilities. 107    It is common but illegal for nursing homes to halt formal therapy services when a resident exhausts Medicare skilled nursing facility coverage. Specialized rehabilitative services are a covered Medi–Cal service and must be provided to residents who need them without charge. 108    Most therapy services do not last more than a few weeks or months. They stop when the doctor discontinues medical orders therapy goals are met treatment proves ineffective or the resident’s needs can be met by regular nursing staff members. Therapists are expected to teach residents and the nursing home staff how to carry out routine exercises that can be safely completed without their direct supervision.   Restorative Care:  As formal therapy services are ending the therapist should set up a care plan that continues needed exercises and other services. For example a resident recovering from a fractured hip might need help walking daily until she regains strength in her legs and is steady on her feet. This type of care which is provided by the facility’s nursing staff is often called restorative care. It should continue as long as needed without any extra fee if Medicare or Medi–Cal is paying for the resident’s nursing home care.   Range of Motion:  Many nursing home residents need routine care to keep the ability to move their hands arms legs and feet. Without proper care residents often lose some ability to move their joints (range of motion) or develop contractures – a freezing of the joint in a contracted position.  Nursing homes must ensure that residents do not lose range of motion unless it is unavoidable and must give appropriate treatment and services to residents who have limited range of motion. 109  Preventive care may include exercise of the joints performed by the resident by the staff or by the resident with assistance from the staff. Range of motion exercises should never be used as a substitute for residents who need specialized therapies from licensed therapists.  Vision Dental and Hearing Care  A resident’s care plan must comprehensively address his or her care needs including needed dental vision and hearing services.  Nursing homes must assist residents in obtaining routine and emergency dental care. 110  Routine care means an annual exam. 111  An emergency involves an episode of pain or other dental problem that requires immediate attention. 112    Nursing homes can arrange services by hiring a dentist or by having an agreement with a dentist to treat residents. 113  If a resident’s dentures are lost or damaged the nursing home is required to make a prompt referral to a dentist and to aggressively work at replacing the dentures. 114    Facilities must also arrange treatment that maintains residents’ abilities to see and hear. 115  If a resident needs hearing or vision care or assistive devices the nursing home should make necessary appointments and arrange transportation if services are delivered away from the facility. 116  Assistive devices means glasses contact lenses magnifying glasses and hearing aids. 117  The facility should help residents and their families locate and utilize any available community resources or payment programs including Medicare and Medi–Cal. 118    Residents may have to pay for dental vision and hearing services they receive unless they have Medi–Cal or other health insurance that covers these services. Medi–Cal does cover this care with some limits.  If a resident on Medi–Cal needs dental vision or hearing services not covered by Medi–Cal (or other uncovered medical expenses) he or she can deduct the costs from the monthly share of cost set by Medi–Cal. 119  A current physician’s prescription is necessary and must be put in the resident’s record at the facility. This prescription must be part of the physician’s plan of care. After a copy of the prescription and the bill is presented to the facility it will deduct the cost from that month’s share of cost and bill the resident for the remaining share of cost.

Thank you to those of you who sent me private messages.  It means the world to me to know that while we have never met you cared enough to check on me.  It's amazing how such a horrible disease can bring people together.     I had to take a few weeks away from life.  I felt as though I would collapse.  I am very much still distraught and feeling weak and lonely and empty.  It has been about 6 weeks now.  I don't know how to move past the denial that she is not coming back.  My mama was my everything. My mama my best friend my support my confidant just everything.     I still wake up running to her room to find her bed empty. I walk into her room and still smell the scent of the last few weeks when she was here. I had to box up everything in her closet because I couldn't stop the obsessive behavior.  That helped some but walking into her room is just painful.  I still stand in front of her picture balling and feeling very cheated that she is gone. I still have major anger issues with the man that contributed to her death.       The past few weeks have been hectic.  I finally got all of the legal issues taken care of.  I have taken care of all the other ""stuff"" that comes with the territory.  The remodeling finally came to an end.  I have cut off all contact with her family for my own good.  I had to have a dental procedure last week which has turned into a nightmare because I had an allergic reaction to the pain medication and well....its all just a product of not caring about me and putting all into taking care of mama.  My mother was the only person to ever touch my hair so this week I stalked several salons to watch who was good and who was bad.  I then walked in on Monday and told the girl to cut it all off so she did.  I cut 10 inches of hair away from my face.  Now I have nothing to hide behind anymore but I do like it.     My son is still overseas and well......we are not privelaged to know his location. I was informed this week also that my daughter who is 17 is now enlisting as well and will be leaving this summer to follow in the footsteps of her brother and her grandfather and all of her great grandfather's before. She will be the first female soldier in our family.  Ohhh the life of a military mom. I am proud of her and I am supporting her decision because she is able to give me a detailed list of her plans.  Scary? Yes!  But I will support her decision just as I did her brother.      I love you all to the moon and back and I am thinking of all of you. I will be back soon.  I'm so sorry that I cannot give back the support that was given to me.  It's only temporary.  I just need to breathe so I can give back what was given to me. You all really were and are still a blessing to me.   I would not have made it through intact without your support.      Love to all~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147510655,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was tested for a UTI and that came back with mixed results so the doctors put her on antibiotics for good measure.  She is also on heavy anti-psychotic meds.  She needs a sitter at the hospital because she refuses to stay in her room and will wander the halls and bother other patients.  (She thinks everyone is a movie star or football player.  If you want an ego boost come on down.  OMG! Your Elizabeth Taylor!)   We went to visit her last night.  She wasn't loopy but she wasn't herself.  Very quite.  First thing out of her mouth ""When can I go home?  I don't understand why I need to be here""  Truth is she is not coming home.  In the last month her condition has worsened.  We are unable to care for her properly. My MIL needs 24hr care now. But you can't tell her that.  You can't tell her she is flying through the stages faster than a kid on a radio flyer on a steep hill.  So her son told her that we are trying to find her a place of her very own where she can rule the roost.  Something special.   Her questions were repeated several times throughout the visit.  Each time it was painful to answer.  She isn't eating a whole lot.  Just snacking.  She did manage to eat 4 homemade cookies we brought.  Always had a sweet tooth.  When we left there were a few tears.  She looked so small.  I can't help but think that this is the beginning of the end.  I feel helpless.   I can't do anything for her.  I can't relieve the stress and pain of her children.      On a cheery note. . .

978,62107f577b65de9a5b670acf,2147510834,2014-11-11 12:57:00,My mom has passed - thank you for your prayers,Thanks to everyone who responded to my prayer request for a speedy passing for my mom.  I read other members' 'end experiences' avidly while my mom was on Hospice in an effort to prepare myself so I will do the same for others.     My mom entered hospice in mid-July - she was losing her ability to walk very rapidly with a slower unsteadier gait and more falls was sleeping quite a bit more and eating and drinking much less and only with a lot of hand-feeding and encouragement.      In early August she fell hard and broke her predominant arm - we had it put in a sling to heal and from then on out she had to be fed exclusively by others. About a month later she fell trying to get out of her wheelchair and hit her head on a table and was taken to the ER for seven stiches to her forehead (even under hospice you can seek medical care for any issues not related to the reason they are on hospice)     September 25th the Hospice doctor told me she had seen changes in my mom indicating she had about two weeks time left. I found this a little unbelievable as the next day I was visiting her and she ate an entire bowl of stew and seemed very lively.      Even though she was generally not really awake when I visited she would grip my hand and sometimes open her eyes and smile at me.     Two weeks ago is when she started the real decline toward death. About 10 days ago we stopped trying to get her out of bed at all and last week she lost her ability to swallow over about three days (sometimes she would not swallow sometimes she would so we kept offering liquids until it was clear she couldn't manage them.)      She had nothing but pain meds and swabs to moisten her mouth starting last Thursday.  As others have said the not providing food and water was by far the most psychologically difficult part for me - even though she wouldn't swallow anything I just felt so terrible for her.     Her death was 'textbook' and I encourage everyone whose LO is on hospice to read up on signs of death on the internet and the pamphlets offered by the hospice team. Knowing these things ahead of time didn't make me cry any less but I also wasn't 'freaked out' by the signs and symptoms that occur.     On her final day (Sunday) I played lot of music for her everything from tracks from Mary Poppins and Singing in the Rain to bluegrass spirituals and her favorite Willie Nelson songs. (BTW even if you don't have a song you can almost certainly find it on YouTube).      About an hour after I left her the facility called to tell us she had passed and we went to stay with her until the funeral home picked up her body.      Despite knowing this was coming I am still a complete mess. I had made her funeral arrangements written her obituary and found out the procedures for submitting it months ago - and I'm so glad I did as I could just operate in 'robot mode' and not have to make a lot of decisions.     My deepest thanks are to the posters who have lost those in the last few months - MamaBear Twink etc.  for their very good advice and those whose LOs have been in hospice at the same time. Your support has been incredible.     I will be taking a little time off but will be back on the boards to support those who are 'coming after' me in this terrible journey.

She reminded me that she'd love to be in my shoes.   Oddly enough even though it wasn't what  I had wanted/expected to hear  it was just what  I needed to hear.   Her perspective reminded me to be grateful for all I had enjoyed.      3) And the final thing happened way back when I was probably 13 years old.  There were some dear family friends who had been on a family vacation.  The 16 year old daughter was driving lost control and had a horrible accident.  Her father in the front seat was killed and the mother was horribly injured.  The two girls thankfully were ok.  The mother Fran wound up in the hospital with multiple painful surgeries multiple pins in her leg and little hope to feel quite normal again.  One day the minister in the community brought Fran a book to pass her time.  She read the book an awful accounting of prisoners in the Nazi camps in WWII.  Here was this woman dealing with the death of her husband her own physical problems displaced in a hospital in a state that wasn't home away from friends and family alone scared and hurt.   When the minister returned Fran asked him ""Why in the world would you give me this book to read?""      ""Because"" he said ""when ever we face our darkest hour it's important to remember that some one else has faced worse trials.  You'll get through this Fran.""     I know that there are some who think we often do nothing but complain about this disease and all it's trials.  And yes I think we need/deserve some of that wound licking.  But on my hard days I grab these stories in my mind.  I try to remind myself that my dad had a pretty darn good life neither he nor I are alone on this journey and to be thankful that I had my father for all these many years of my life.  And on really bad days I go through a list of all the diseases I can call worse than AD.  My dad is not in pain  he doesn't even know he's dying he's not frightened or alone.

While that is very possible I'm somewhat at a loss as to what to do about it.  My MIL's doctor got tired of dealing with UTI's and said she must go to a urologist.  After several antibiotic courses the urologist said to not drag her in unless she had:     -blood in the urine  -fever  -especially foul smelling urine  -pain while urinating          The urologist said that given her age/condition she's always going to have bacteria in her urine and that they can't really help her.      While I understand that her life expectancy is pretty limited it still seems like both her MD and urologist have given up on her and decided to let the disease run its course.       Bringing this full circle can chewing up Divalproex make an ALZ patient's behavior very similar to one with a UTI?        Side note we're trying to get an appointment next week with another doctor to get a second opinion.....,False,wks,2014-07-20,15.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147510493,,,AlzConnected,,,

Anyway my question here is; how do I get started taking control?  I think I've figured out that is my pain point right now.  Mom has always been living independtly on her own in her own house for over 7 years.  She has been paying the bills keeping the house up (sorta) taking care of herself driving up until 1 year ago and bascially functioning.  Seeing her now I have no idea how she did it but she did.  And her eyes she can function fine.    She can't though.  I bascially forced her to sell her house move across the country told her she not independnet enought to even live by herself in a retirement community and now here she is. . .. . .    So how do I get her to give me her medicine to dole it out to her?  Let me help her shower get her to allow us to wash her clothes clean her room not horde the mail (including our mail) etc; basically take care of her?    She needs it things like the medicine are now a seroius health issue but short of physically confronting her I'm at a loss at how to begin to manage her life for her.

He had a rapid cognitive decline where he couldn't find his words which made him irritable and her scared. We went to 4 appointments to a neurologists who ordered a PET scan to check for ALZ a brain MRI an EEG and a corotid artery ultrasound. All the testing took about 2 weeks. The PET scan did not show the classic alz signs but showed slowed blood flow to the brain which led to the other 3 tests.  And the other tests were normal.  So Dad has some sort of dementia.  We just don't know what kind.  And no medication has been prescribed. The PCP said that at least 3 more tests would probably be ordered. So this process will go on even longer. And I'm wondering if it's even worth taking more tests. I'm thinking about getting a second opinion from another neurologist.     As we all tried to adapt and with the help of their PCP and friends of their church they both made the decision to enter into assisted living. After shopping around a bit we found 2 great places and then within a week.... Mom fell developed an infection and died. My 36th birthday was on September 20 the day we made the heartbreaking decision to take her off of life support and she passed away 5 days later.  Her funeral was about 3 weeks ago so understandably moving into assisted living screeched to a halt.       So aside from not being able to find his words Dad lost his best friend. He's still living in their house alone. I work full time and I check in as much as I can his neighbors check on him and members of his church check on him.  It really does take a village.   I'm still having trouble communicating with him but I've tried to do research.       We had a rough outing to visit his sister where Dad bit my head off multiple times out of frustration when he couldn't find the words to finish a story. I was really struggling to keep my cool and told him I want to figure out how to communicating that. Because biting my head off just pisses me off and that doesn't help anything. I hugged him later and realized that he's at his best mentally in the morning/early afternoon (the outing was in the evening which tired him out.) So realizing that I can adapt was pretty empowering.     After 2 weeks of letting Dad breathe and process this hellish last month I delicately approached assisted living.  We have an assessment at a beautiful facility about 5 minutes away which does have memory care as well.  I'm keeping it light and positive. And he's keeping an open mind.  But the guilt tears me apart. And it's awful but I feel like I can't grieve because I have to take care of him.  Which makes me resentful. (Weekly visits to my therapist as well as Wellbutrin help however.)    Anyway that's my story. Thank you for letting me ramble.  And I'm so glad I found this community.

Admitted treated with IV released back to assisted living.    A week or so later severe pain in side/abdomen (it was either this time or last time that she was also dragging one of her legs).

Discharged after a few days back to assisted living.

After physical therapy got her up for first time today with much effort and they had to closely assist her walking with a walker they determined she is good to be discharged today and back to assisted living! I had to challenge the evaluation. She is weak and based on what I saw with the physical therapist she is not ready to be on her own.     I asked the doctor if these issues are related he said no.      The assisted living is suggesting she can stay there and be on hospice.        My questions are:    1.

I hope we are past some of the hurdles I hate to think we'll have to deal with the stonewalling 'til the bitter and inevitable end.     I've tried to stay positive and up but there are some times when I just start crying and can't quit.  I try to keep my focus on the ultimate future when my mother will be whole and well again.  It's difficult to maintain that vision when I see her looking bewildered and frightened.  Just having a down time I guess.     Yesterday morning they discovered a blister on her left heel.  I went with her to see the PA about a referral to a podiatrist last Monday (fungus infection in her toenails) and I didn't see it when he took her socks off.  So..........where did that come from I wonder.  I am losing this race and I can't seem to find the starting line.  Sorry to be blithering but I know that people here don't mind.  I do check the message board almost every day and find encouragement hope and pray for those of you that are traveling in the same direction.  God's blessings to all of you.........kay-t-did,False,kay-t-did,2014-04-06,81.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509666,,,AlzConnected,,,

It was at that time that I noticed my mom was forgetting things. When I tried to bring this observation up to my siblings (all older) and other family members including my father I was told I was just overreacting I'm the baby and just wanting drama. As of last Friday my now husband and I have moved my parents into our home to help my father. Am  I pissed that no one would listen to me over the years heck yea but the situation is now what it is and that isn't going to change.         My mother has declined fast. She lost over 100 lbs in less than 4 months a few years ago because she refuses to eat or drink. She also went from a year ago being able to hold a conversation even if it was repetitive to 90% of the time physically and verbally abusive refuses to take her meds threatens to kill us stays awake for over 24 hours and if one of us falls asleep screams and hits the person to wake them up (knows she is doing it) and that is just the quick icing. That 10% when she isn't she is my mother and I think that is what makes this harder; she apologizes worries she is going to screw me up and takes her meds.          My husband and I knew that this was not going to be an easy situation but you do what needs to be done for family. However the reality that we are now in is something we never imagined. We are in constant fear of the physical attacks and of her threats to stab us while we are sleeping. The constant barrage of hate and name calling is mentally taxing especially for my father who is mostly her focus. He has neuralgia so has his own meds and issues. The more stress the more he has to use the muscles in his face the worse pain he is in.         They both had their first appointment with the new doctor today. Mom had heavy blood in her urine a b12 deficiency (still not eating) and she felt something malignant in my moms abdomen. We left with only a script for an antibiotic for whatever they found in the urine and appointments for other tests (ct chest X-ray blood work mammogram). No med changes (lorazepam 0.5 mg 3xdaily quetiapine 25 mg at bed) not that she takes them regularly nothing for when she is on an all night rampage like tonight.         I guess I needed to vent because in one week I feel like I'm about to mentally break but to also see if this is normal. If there are suggestions for this situation. I worked with kids who had mental and behavioral disorders at a residential treatment facility so I am trying to take that training and apply to her but again 90% of the time of the anger is still very taxing.

She left behind a 94 year old husband that just hadn't acted right for at least 5 years. She kept him in line. She had an angel's way of keeping his explosive rages from ever (mostly) making their way public. As a bed bound blind dying woman she kept him (mostly) calm.    Again she died in April. With her went his calm.    Details aren't important but suffice it to say it didn't take long for the fabric of his existence to start unraveling in ways I'd never seen before. He refused to leave his home. He refused adequate caregivers to come into his home and help him. For a brief while with the help of friends and a mother to which I'm eternally grateful he moved to an Independent living facility. For at least 3 weeks he thought it was the best thing that ever happened to him. Then as quickly as eyes blink he thought it was the worst thing that ever happened to him in his entire life. He finagled a ride back to his old home without food a phone a TV or a soul in line to help him attain these basic needs.    He started to resent me. Actually he started to hate me. I took his car keys away and again details aside it got very ugly. He would not allow the mention of my name. To his dwindling list of friends he referred to me as ""my ex-granddaughter"".   He was doing dangerous things with his money and with his life. I cried over the very idea but I decided something had to be done to help him. I sat in front of a judge two times with my right hand raised.    ""I do solemnly swear that I will well and truly perform the duties required of me as guardian of the ward named above and faithfully account to my ward for my ward's estate So help me God.""    Both times I clearly remember stating in a bold but shaky voice ""I do Your Honor"". I remember both times my pen hit the order for guardianship I paused and allowed a thousand thoughts to stampede their way through my mind in a matter of two seconds. You can't sit in front of a judge and request he should strip the legal rights from the proudest man that ever stood 6 feet tall (5'10 now) and not feel pain. I would imagine anyone who doesn't has a heart made of frozen stone. Then both times I signed my name.    His hospitalization began August 3rd.    At first he went in because the day he was served those wretched papers he got so upset he was shaking and screaming and spitting. I don't even like to think of what his mind considered at that moment. A doctor had said to me the week before ""his mind is like a computer without a processor all this data and nothing to make it all make sense"". That was also the first time somebody besides me and my family and his friends had uttered the word dementia.    Grandpa has been in the hospital for 39 days. Doctors found all sorts of problems with his heart and other health issues that hadn't been properly addressed in his old age. They addressed them one by one and even put in a pacemaker.    His big day was last Tuesday. I had found an assisted living facility here in town with a memory care unit that was the most perfect fit ever. In fact and I even told the administrators this it's as if they pushed a button every time I walked in and everybody looked so happy and engaged and happy and happy. A 94 year old man just shouldn't be unhappy. A nurse there fell in love with him when she visited him in the hospital. She told me she wanted to work with him every single day personally. That wasn't her job but she insisted she could help him. I saw rainbows and ponies and kittens.   Then last Tuesday came and as I was rushing around getting his little apartment JUST perfect the phone rang. "" we've just discovered your father (for the last time it's my GRANDFATHER you jackass) has a very serious infection in his pacemaker wound. MRSA isn't something anybody wants to get much less in the skin pocket that holds the gizmo with wires that lead straight to your heart.    ""We're transporting him to another hospital for surgery to remove the pacemaker"".    I got wobbly. I started to do that thing where you breathe really fast and tears are about to start shooting out of every orifice in your body then I stopped. ""This is life"" said me. So many things have happened in the last 3 months where those tears lined up quickly in preparation for an explosive presentation but most every time I held those unhelpful bastards back with those words THIS IS LIFE.   Again more details aside but in the last 2 weeks I have haggled with yelled at almost spit on and hugged more doctors than I could ever count. I've tried desperately to get him safely discharged but as one doctor put it ""boy you just keep hitting roads blocks huh?"" I've been at the hospital most every day but I haven't seen him nearly that often. That's because while he's much calmer he still hates me some days.   Thursday was his 95th birthday and nursing staff told me it would be best if I didn't see him bc he'd had a good day but angry thoughts about me.    Tonight was different. For the first time in 3 months he called me punkin turkey and huzzie (all pet names) all in one visit. He smiled so big for a picture then said ""Wait! Get my teeth!"" He promised to be nice again tomorrow if I bring him another present. Just inches from his sweet blue eyes I got in his face and promised him he could trust me.   As hard as this has been on me it has been so much harder on him. Remember I have a processor he doesn't.   As brutal and horrific and as ghastly as this whole ordeal has been I'd recommend every person alive go through it before they're 40. I've learned more about caring love grit commitment strength and life in 3 months than I have in 34 years.    I share this from my heart. I'm not really sure why. I think mostly it's because I want everybody to know just what you can endure emotionally with just 3 words ""This is life."" I want everybody to be aware that in every situation we have a choice in how we perceive it and how we march forward to deal with it. I MOST CERTAINLY don't claim that I've flawlessly navigated my way through this dusty mapless maze. But here we are (Good Lord willing and I swear if that damned creek rises again I'm going to put another patch on this damned raft and float that rascal until it sinks) just a few days away from his big ""coming out"" (of the hospital) party.    He is still here and I am still here and I am assured that in my heart… this is love.",False,needair,2013-03-28,6.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509359,,,AlzConnected,,,

Other times she is as sweet as normal - saying she loves Dad so much and loves where they live.     I am worried about Dad being so stressed about the situation.       The real issue is that Mom is very strong willed and will not do what she doesn't think she needs to do.  She MUST take thyroid medication as her thyroid was shutdown by radiation long ago.  When they first arrived here she had a frightening spell (for Dad and I) where she lost consciousness and the paramedics took her to the hospital.  The doctor there said she was taking too much of the thyroid medication. Now that they are in a place where there is a health center onsite they have asked Dad to handle Mom's medication.  This only works when Mom is in a good mood and wants to take it.  Her last bloodwork showed that it was at the right level.  The doctor has asked if she would take a memory test and she says ""NO"" and will walk out of the room. I went to the doctor with Mom and dad twice and I think it makes matters worse.  When Dad was getting 3 biopsies for possible basal cell Mom saw him grimace and I could see her getting angry.  She said ""I feel like I could just shoot somebody"" and then she looked at the doctor and said ""Shut up!"".     My sister and I looked online at several assisted living places that also have memory care but they start around $4000 and go up to $6000 (probably the memory care is at the high end).  Dad can't afford that and neither can my sister or I.  I don't even know how we could manage to get Mom into one of those places.  She would just stand her ground and not move.       My sister thinks it's going to take something catastrophic to get Mom the help she needs but doesn't want.       My husband stopped working 4 years ago due to a surgery that caused chronic debilitating pain so I am the only one working.  I usually call Mom and Dad in the morning to see how things are.  When I hear Dad answer I WANT desperately to hear that Mom is in a good mood.  Usually he says ""she's on the warpath again today"".  One time he called and left me a message asking for help.  I didn't get the message right away as I was working.  I called back and he said things were getting better.     Recently my sister (a little like Mom with being strong willed) was over there visiting and Mom was in a terrible mood.  She came out and said ""you're not my daughter and I don't want you here - get out!"".  My sister laughed (I don't know why - she says it's because she thought it was ludicrous) and Mom hit her in the nose and tried kicking her.  My sister held Mom's hands down and finally Mom just walked back into the bedroom.  My sister called me to tell me what happened when she got home and I raced over there with my dog and we were able to get Mom back to a good mood.     I just can't leave work Monday through Friday and sometimes I don't get home until about 6 p.m. and then there are chores to do.     I'm feeling hopeless but I'm praying because I tend to hang on to my anxiety like it was a best friend and I hate it.  I hate taking medication and I hate that this is happening to Mom and Dad.  I don't know where to turn. If Mom would allow it I would have them stay at my house but she refuses to do that saying ""we stayed with our parents and it just doesn't work out well"".    I have coworkers telling me she has to go to a memory care facility.  Of course she does but how do I make that happen?  She won't budge.  She won't take medication if she doesn't want to.     Now that I've written all this I'm anxious again.  I hope there are some answers out there for me.     Thanks for taking the time to read this.",False,ns121845,2013-06-07,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509304,,,AlzConnected,,,
1010,621082d77b65de9a5b671aac,2147509323,2014-09-15 20:55:00,Help me think through complex hospitalization NG tube for bowel obstruction gallbladder? psych meds being held etc.,Hi All     Mom was admitted to the hospital Friday night w severe abdominal pain and vomiting. They found an obstructed bowel though have not been able to identify an exact cause. They also found some gallstones and potential sludge in gallbladder waiting for doctors comments on additional gallbladder tests. She's has an NG tube in to empty out her stomach to hopefully allow the intestines to correct themselves.  All food liquids and ORAL MEDS are being held. i was told this procedure is very effective- 80-90% success rate. She is getting some meds through an IV though I found out they were holding her seizure med for some unsettling reason I don't know about.  She had the tube in for about 36 hours then pulled it out. It sat out for maybe 30 hours( another time she pulled it out again) until 2pm today when they put it back in.  I okay'ed them putting on mitts to keep her from yanking it and they were working today.  An xray of intestines yesterday showed slight improvement.            I could use some help figuring out how/when  and WHAT to say/ask the doctors about care for not only her medical issues but also managing her psychiatric meds so that we don't end up with another psychotic episode ( see below).  Also how to do with this while working full time in a school where it's more difficult to take time off. ( I can but it requires careful planning and deciding about whether we need a sub or not.)I also don't want to take too much now as I don't know how much I might need later on at discharge or god knows what else may happen.    There are two teams involved- medical internal medicine and surgical. The internal  med doc was nice but pessimistic. Mentioned hospice if NG tube doesn't  help blockage. He does not think mom's gallbladder is an issue because most labs were normal though catscan etc tests showed sludge and gallstones and say you can't rule out chronic something or other meaning gallbladder inflammation.  The surgical team was thinking that a gallbladder drain might help mom and have something to do with the blockage.               OF COURSE   THIS HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE MOM'S PSYCH MEDS AVAILABLE INTRAVENOUSLY OR THROUGH AN IM so she has not gotten any since Friday except for her Depakote which started last night.  UGH.  So far she had been doing amazing well lucid and stable  and sweet in spite of dementia and all of the discomfort until this evening when I saw signs of psychosis- talking to herself or perhaps a voice? and being mean to me.  I figure that the half life of Abilify her mind saving med would wear off in about 72 hours and that's about where we are.  This is a major concern to me as mom has such a terrible history of psych issues that were finally stabilized on Abilify when many other meds failed. As a result I'm wary of trying a substitute med in the hospital.         I've expressed my concern about the psych meds to one of the regular nurses and she said she thought it was too early( that was Sat and Sun) and then to the surgical doc and he said they could give her Ativan but that's as far as it's gotten with talking to them.         I'm not taking any time off tomorrow so won't see the attending but could call  and try to talk by phone.  I really feel the need to express my concerns and also ask what is the rationale for holding her seizure med.  Any advice from you all would be appreciated.  Part of me thinks maybe it will all turn out we shoudl get the medical thing handled then deal w the psych but if she goes over the edge she will start refusing meds and then it becomes SO SO hard to deal with. Unfortunatley I did not have a good experience with this hospital's psychiatric unit and don't trust their team.  I would not want them involved.    If things got really bad both medically and mentally for mom would it be unreasonable to consider transferring to a hospital that has the Ablify in IV or intramuscular form? (  It DOES exist as an IM as she got it at two different hospitals in Ohio before she moved. )  OR....would just giving her Ativan through the IV be enough to keep her somewhat manageable and then attempt to get the Abilify going once she gets back to the nursing home?  That will be tricky but perhaps doable involving coaxing and sneaking it into food etc.               Anyone deal with NG tubes before w loved ones?   Given mom's situation is it reasonable to ask if they could take the tube out to admister her mind and really life saving Abilify then put the tube back in?    A few people in the ER had mentioned something to this effect so should I push for this?  Not the time for me to be a patsy.                    If you made it to the end of this post- thank you!  I'm really trying to figure this out and do the best for mom.  Would appreciate any advice!,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509323,,,AlzConnected,,,

1012,6210833f7b65de9a5b671c7b,2147509161,2014-09-09 22:55:00,Certain prescription drugs may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease,"I   put this in the oh great category:              Drugs used for anxiety sleep are linked to Alzheimer's disease in older people         Older people who have relied on a class of drugs called benzodiazepines to reduce anxiety or induce sleep are at higher risk of going on to develop Alzheimer's disease new research finds with those whose use of the medications is most intensive almost twice as likely to develop the mind-robbing disorder.         Benzodiazepines -- marketed under such names as as Xanax Valium Ativan and Klonopin -- are widely used to  treat insomnia   agitation and anxiety all of which can be early signs of impending Alzheimer's disease in the elderly. But the current study sought to disentangle benzodiazepines' use in treating early dementia symptoms probing instead the possibility that heavy use of the medications may permit cause or hasten the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.         The study compared the pattern of benzodiazepine use in 1796 people elderly people diagnosed with Alzheimer's with that of 7184 similar people who had no such diagnosis. Such a study design conducted by French and Canadian researchers and published Tuesday in the journal BMJ cannot by itself establish that more intensive use of the medications causes Alzheimer's disease. But it does strengthen such suspicions.         Among the   study participants   over 66 who were living independently in the Canadian province of Quebec those who took low-dose benzodiazepine medication or who took higher doses but very briefly or infrequently did not see their Alzheimer's risk go up five years after they were first prescribed such a medication. But the picture was more worrisome for those who frequently took long-acting benzodiazepines who frequently took high doses or who took any such drugs regularly over several months.         The benzodiazepines specifically considered by the researchers were the short-acting anti-anxiety medications alprazolam (Xanax) lorazepam (Ativan) oxazepam (Seresta) and diazepam (Valium) and the longer-acting anti-seizure and ""hypnotic"" drugs frequently used to treat   insomnia  : clonazepam (Klonopin) flurazepam (Dalmane) midazolam (Versed) nitrazepam (Mogadon) temazepam (Restoril) and triazolam (Halcion).         The widely prescribed prescribed medicines marketed as Ambien Lunesta and Sonata (generically named zolpidem eszopiclone and zaleplon) are ""atypical benzodiazepines"" and were not included in the analysis.         The authors of the study created an index that gauged the intensity of a participant's benzodiazepine use and found that at the end of a five-year period following an initial prescription Alzheimer's risk mounted steadily. Those who took the cumulative equivalent of daily doses for three to six months over a five-year period were roughly 32% more likely than those who took none to develop Alzheimer's. Those who took the cumulative equivalent of a full daily dose for more than six months were 84% more likely to do so.         There's already strong research evidence that frequent or regular benzodiazepine use degrades memory and mental performance in humans and animals. And some research suggests that with regular use of this class of drugs the receptors to which they bind in the brain become less active. And lower   activity   of those receptors has been linked to cognitive decline.         ""In view of the evidence it is now crucial to encourage physicians to carefully balance the risks and benefits when initiating or renewing a treatment with benzodiazepines and related products in older patients"" the authors wrote.         International medical guidelines recommend the use of benzodiazepines as  treatment   for anxiety disorders and transcient insomnia but caution that they are not meant for long-term use and should not be taken steadily for more than three months. But many patients continue to take these drugs for years. In addition to their cognitive effects benzodiazepines are widely implicated in the national epidemic of opioid pain medication overdoses and fatalities that result from mixing them with alcohol and opioid drugs.",False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509161,,,AlzConnected,,,

I wanted to keep my parents out of any nursing facilities because of the help they gave me with my children (they are all grown now). My children were very very young when they started helping me.  I worked full-time.      I have not been taking care of myself which is not unusual for a caregiver. Actually I have not been taking care of myself properly for years. Last year I had a physical. I was pre-diabetic and my level of vitamin D was very low. I was told to lose weight. I have been told these things before by my previous primary doctor.  Last year my doctor put me on prescription vitamin D. One pill once a week for I think it was 6 weeks (this was the second time in 3 years I was on prescription vitamin D). I told myself last year that this time I was going to take care of myself. I made plans but those plans quickly disappeared.          I realized in July of this year that I was in CAREGIVER OVERDRIVE!!!  How did I know?             My mother takes D3 along with other meds once a day.  I am the one that gives her all her meds.         I was giving my mom the D3 and for some reason that day it dawned on meI was making sure she had all her meds everyday but what about myself. I looked at the D3 bottle and just stared at it. Then the things I knew about vitamin  D deficiency that were in the back of mind came to the front.  I realized what I knew all along but ignored. That I was making sure everyone’s needs were cared for not my own.       I know what having low vitamin D means to my health. I know that having low levels could mean heart trouble cancer cognitive impairment bone and muscle pain and weakness etc.  But not once in the past 10 months did I say “Let me take my vitamin D as soon as I give mom hers”.  My giving her the D3 should have been a reminder for me but it wasn't.      I had my physical for the year about 2 weeks ago. This time there were some other health issues added to the list.  And this time I have to take     prescription   vitamin D once a week for 6 MONTHS!!!!!           TIME TO SLOW DOWN!!!!!!               I am making arrangements now to put my mom in respite for several weeks and after that daycare.  And every summer she will go into respite care.  This way I can start a good routine for myself. Exercise eating correctly and finally hopefully getting proper rest.       I told myself when we first moved in together that I was not going to jeopardize my health. I was going to make sure I took good care of myself.  But when you are in CAREGIVER OVERDRIVE you don’t pay attention to yourself the way you should.       I am going to take care of myself. I want to see my grandchild grow to an adult. At the rate I am going now I will not see my grandchild get to kindergarten.       Caregivers please don’t let yourself get to the point I am or worse.

By Elaine C. Pereira    Alzheimer's Reading Room           Increasing funding for Alzheimer’s research is crucial!  Also crucial is having an accurate understanding of the facts about Alzheimer’s.  No disrespect to the already well informed but the general public needs a better knowledge base to recognize the subtle often excused-away symptoms of dementia issues.    It’s on us who are more enlightened to educate those who are not and dispel the myths of the misinformed.    Just as breast cancer supporters have worked tirelessly to advance research funding with their Pink ribbon campaign Alzheimer’s awareness advocates need to make Purple the new Pink!  Maybe these basic facts will help others.  Please pass them on.        ALZHEIMER'S IS A REAL NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE Even people with only a minimal understanding of medical issues grasp the basics of major diseases like cancer diabetes or heart problems.  In fact my son-in-law’s high school juniors know that when a stroke occurs on one side of the brain it affects the opposite side of the body.  That said however most people don’t have an adequate understanding of Alzheimer’s or dementia.    Alzheimer’s is a real fatal progressive disease with no treatments.  It is not just a quirky personality change.    Because of how the disease affects the individual’s brain their personality is affected usually causing adverse changes.  Hostility paranoia suspicion are frequent first indications in otherwise kind individuals.      I’m an occupational therapist and talked frequently with my husband about my mother’s deterioration from Alzheimer’s.  I was stunned an understatement really to find out last year that he did not know that Alzheimer’s “caused real brain changes.”    During a television spot on Alzheimer’s my husband and I saw two brain scan images placed side by side.  One showed a normal adult brain and the other the brain of someone with Alzheimer’s.  The contrast was striking.  It was unmistakable comparing the shriveled mottled darkened brain of the person affected by Alzheimer’s disease.   I could hardly believe that having lived with me every step of every arduous day of my mother’s journey through dementia that he still didn’t “get” that Alzheimer’s was a real brain destroying disease!  If my husband could genuinely remain in the dark after all of his experiences so can anyone else.      _________________________________________________     Trending Topics      Alzheimer's Communication    Alzheimer's Caregiving Tips    Memory Loss      _________________________________________________    2. By the time Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed it has been present in and changing the brain for years.   Current research indicates that Alzheimer’s may exist in the brain causing neurological deterioration for as many as ten years before symptoms appear.   A disease or condition that has virtually no physiological clues is especially challenging to diagnosis and find treatments for.  Physical symptoms like pain shortness of breath unexplained weakness double vision etc. are disconcerting enough to bring one to the doctor.    But Alzheimer’s has chipped and chiseled away at one’s brain long before years in fact there are undeniable memory and personality changes that “are disconcerting enough to bring one to the doctor.”      3. Alzheimer's is the only disease in the top 10 that currently has no cure treatment or means of prevention. *   Scary isn’t it!    Early detection is the singular difference in saving lives for every disease or medical condition.  And by extension knowledge is power or empowerment to get diagnosed and begin treatment early.    But with Alzheimer’s there is no early detection option.   Most likely Alzheimer’s will always be a disease in which clear symptoms follow well after the onset.  Although it is not the only condition that is relatively asymptomatic until it’s “too late” it is the only one in the top ten.  The hope may lie in biomarkers measurable indicators like blood sugar levels heart attack enzymes or CA125 (cancer marker).  A test that can indicate elevated risk factors for Alzheimer’s by which treatments can begin before the “too late” point is reached would be epic!

In order to fly him back to US soil they would have to dismantle his whole team which would not just affect him but all involved. And my Mama would not want that for him because she was so darn proud of him for his military service.       Today I had to be at the funeral home again. I had to identify her body. Even though the funeral home removed her and knew who I was I legally still had to identify her.  They had her body prepared and did their best to present her.  What I found when I walked in was that this disease had taken away her beauty and she did not look like my Mama. I cannot go into details as the pain is so great.  As soon as I walked through the door of the chapel I began sobbing and could barely keep my composure.  They really did try to work wonders on presenting her.  But I could only see what the disease had done.  What an aweful feeling.     We had to see our attorney and do more legal paperwork.  That was painful in itself.  Who wants to sit there and discuss what they are entitled too? Not me! I would give everything I owned and live in a cardboard box if I could have my Mama back.     Once our errands were done I came home and passed out for three hours. Only to wake up to Hospice coming in to remove the equipment and this was well.....once again paiful as I realized this was the end of this chapter.     I was told to expect this moment.  I was not sure what to expect but I cannot even place it into words because everything is just a painful blur.  I know a new clock has begun ticking....the clock of grieving.  However this pain is just all to great.  I am going to take some personal quiet time to just reflect.       Much love to all of you who have given such great advice and kind words through this journey.     ~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509406,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'd go back to January and take every minute of craziness and scariness and exhaustion just to have her here.      I'm sharing my experience in grief now so that those who follow will know that they are not alone and that each person will have an experience of their own. And for those that are already there....you get it.      It's been 5 days since Mama passed and this is aweful. I'm finding that I have developed this behavior....much like my mother after the death of my daddy.  I just pick a spot and scrub it for hours.  I finished putting her room back together and found that I became fiercly protective over it. I rearranged the pictures on her dresser several times. I adjusted the comforter several times again fluffed the curtains again dusted even though it didn't have any dust.  If someone walked into that room just to say how pretty it looked I was anxiously waiting for them to ""get the hell out of it"".  What is this?       I want to donate her clothing to Hospice. It is a reminder of her presence yet I cry each time I look at her favorite shirt. I want to leave it all there but I don't want to see it there. Does that makes sense? I took her favorite outfit and put it in the corner of her closet.  No one can touch that sweater and pants.     My husband who has been my rock suggested that maybe I might feel better if I took the mattress off the floor in the living room and slept in Mama's bed for a few days. Maybe it would bring me a feeling of closeness and warmth because I would lay across Mama's bed for hours before the hospital bed.  I had nightmares all night.       I woke up hearing the soundscapes that I use to play for her. I woke up hearing her breathing.  I woke up seeing her laying in her hospital bed. I woke up from a dream of walking into the funeral home.  The list goes on.     I am such a strong person and this is for the birds! I know I must give myself time and I know that each person must go through this. I know that my mind must work through the pain of the loss.  As much as I want silence in the silence is where I hear and see the reminders of her passing.  The things that brought me comfort of her presence are now silent.  Her breathing...I listened all night so I always knew even in my sleep that she was still here. The sound of the air mattress adjusting the sound of the nurses moving about the sound of foot steps......all gone.  I always knew she was up and about by the noises in her room. I could tell exactly where she was. The closet she kept her purse in it had a sqeaking door.  The big closet for her clothing it had a funny noise too. The chime that sat across from her bed to alert me when she got up silent.      I find myself just busting out in tears in the most random places only to have people staring at me and then getting angry when they do.      Yes my friends there are definately a million emotions in the process.  I will keep you all posted.  I'm going to clean Mama's room again. I'm sure she is looking down from Heaven wondering what the hell I am doing. I stopped at her picture last night and giggled as I told her ""Mama you picked a fine time to do this. I thougth we agreed on waiting until AFTER your 100th birthday party"".  I know that seems so odd but that party is for some reason a big sticking point in my mindf.  My own version and expectation of her being here forever.......     ~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509468,,,AlzConnected,,,
1018,621083aa7b65de9a5b671e74,2147489818,2012-07-04 17:46:00,Mom Alzheimer's and Cannabis,Mom was diagnosed as late stage six when she came to me from Seattle four years ago.  She was given six more months to live. She began displaying symptoms before 1998 but she wasn’t diagnosed until 2001 following her first husband’s death.  It took that long to resolve other health issues and get her to a neurologist.  Just the thought of Alzheimer’s frightened her so that we eventually had to trick her to get her to a doctor for testing.   Once tested and diagnosed they put her on Aricept which brought back cognitive skills with slow decline for the next seven years while my step brother cared for her in her own home.  Along with other western meds this was her medical course.  When Mom’s Alzheimer’s progressed to the point that she became combative and personal hygiene became an issue my brother planned to put her in a nursing home but I quit my job to look after her.  I moved her to Portland with me and took over her care to focus on the quality of her remaining life.  For five months prior to her arrival I immersed myself into learning as much about Alzheimer’s as possible researching and joining The Alzheimer’s Association as well as the Online Alzheimer’s Support Group spending as much time as possible conversing with patients and caregivers alike to prepare myself for the task.  When Mom arrived besides being on five over the counter drugs she was on three inhalers and a pill for asthma blood pressure meds allergy meds anti psychotics that made her angry anti seizure meds that made her delusional plus three others I have no idea what they were used to combat.  We got her an OMMP card immediately upon her arrival.  She had smoked cannabis recreationally with me for over thirty years but never medically until she came toOregon. Cannabis was my only means of mitigating her despicable behavior (psychotic).  Her physical health was also poor so I changed her diet eliminated dairy wheat and gluten. I prepared and feed her home cooked meals using whole organic ingredients supplemented with quality vitamins and minerals.  I’ve continued to work with her doctor to straighten out her mishmash of meds.  He started with large doses of anti psychotics to combat the behavioral issues (with potential seizure/death side effect) and we systematically took her off as many of the other drugs as possible.  Meanwhile I started trying the different forms of cannabis concentrates.  The first extractions were cannabis essential oils using hot grape seed oil but she didn’t like the flavor and refused to ingest it.  Given that unused meds are 100% ineffective I next tried honey elixir thinking she might go for the sweetness of the honey but no luck.  No luck with fudge either even though she loves chocolate.  I quickly determined that the only way to get substantial doses into mom would be via concentrates so after experimenting with bubble hash combined with coconut oil as a menstruum I focused on hash oil in an effort to improve consistency and homogeneity for consistency in dosing.  More specifically I began to experiment on my version of the Holy Anointing Oil from Exodus using coconut oil instead of olive oil and brewed from essential oils as opposed to using the biblical perfumer’s extraction practices.    It worked beautifully!  The flavor of the cannabis was concealed by the remaining essential oils in the ingredients.  She loved it and to my delight she became happier and less combative.  Mom transformed from aggressive and angry to the cheerful woman I knew from childhood.  Instead of slapping my cheeks she caressed them tenderly and moved my hair from my face as she told me she loved me.  From her isolation came the interaction and humor required to joke with us.   From frantic shuffling and hiding of objects she began offering them for my use.  Rather then kicking biting and hitting she became happily compliant even cooperative.  She literally became a social butterfly!  Mom also suffered extensively from muscle spasms particularly in her legs typically relieved by dancing the night away together. But one night I thinned some HAO oral with coconut oil to reduce the cinnamon oil below topical TLV as an irritant and to improve penetration.  After slathering her leg with the modified HAO the cramps went away allowing her to go back to sleep.  She woke 20 minutes later complaining of the other leg.  Again HAO topical and back to sleep! HAOT was born.  It took nearly two years working with her doctor to get her medical care stabilized and a permanent “Primary Care Practitioner” (PCP) established.  We were able to get her off of most of the original drug regiment and determined that her psychotic episodes were directly related to urinary tract infections for which she is susceptible.  With cultures and medications we were able to get the UTIs in check which eliminated the need for the anti psychotic Seroquil.  We determined that it was medicating the behavioral issues related to UTI’s rather then psychotic behavior associated with dementia.  Since Seroquil has black box warnings (death) for the elderly I was more than pleased to eliminate it.  She had begun having seizures after starting seroquil. a potential side effect even with anti seizure meds.  The pharmaceutical consultation revealed anti seizure meds also cause seizures if doses are missed late or low dose was taken.  Once on anti seizure meds one must stay on them.  He warns that it permanently lowers the resistance to seizures although other pharmacists suggested a slow taper is possible.  The delusional side effects of Dilantin her original medication are ill advised for a demented patient.   It took me nearly two and a half years to talk the doctors into letting me try a slow wean off the Dilantin hoping the fact she had not taken Seroquil for over six months and that her cancer doses of cannabis might stop potential seizures.  Although her cognitive capabilities were notably and significantly improved she still seized even with using a slow taper and cannabis.  We next went to Depekote which gave her diarrhea.  We weaned her slowly as it is also an antidepressant.  That took nearly three weeks.  The diarrhea kept her in constant battles with UTIs which tend to promote seizures in demented patients a vicious downward spiral.  We began feeding her Metamucil cookies.  It seemed like that was all she ate.  We then put her on Lamotragine.  When she seized the dose was increased…..which gave her diarrhea.  Back to that vicious cycle.  More cookies and holy root balm to rescue her poor little raw butt! I used MU’s recipe with my twist (thanks MU!).  Next we tried Gabapentin hoping that she would acclimate to the initial drowsiness.  Again she seized on the dose so we increased the night dose to compensate.  The results were diarrhea….more cookies.  Keppra is well accepted for seizures but it too gives Mom diarrhea.  Opium tincture is the last choice drug for its control.  Dosing is easier and we have more time and room for nutritious/delicious food.  It was time for closer supervision; she was placed on in home hospice care.  Weekly she gets visits from health care social and spiritual sectors.  I don’t know what we will try next; perhaps if Mom had never gone on anti seizure meds (off label for muscle spasms) she would only be on cannabis today.  She has never had seizures until now nor have there been any record of seizures in our family…ever!  She was given Dilantin for muscle spasms when western medicine quit prescribing Quinine deeming it damaging to the body and seizures are not?  But perhaps the seizures are caused by Alzheimer’s itself an unusual but occasional occurrence.  The good and interesting news is with all of what has been happening to mom I began a mega dose (two plus grams/day) to try and alter her mood.  We dose her every two hours (or our life is hell).  During that period of time I increased her dose to between .3 and .5 grams.  That is six or seven doses a day or on the light side 62 grams per month….more then a cancer cure…in one month.  The results were quite unexpected.  The cognitive changes were unmistakably positive.  She began to interact appropriately become more animated and loving and appropriately reactive choosing short phrases.  In short her cognitive thinking had improved!  She even played jokes on us. When Dino came to visit; she hugged him and kissed him and said “it’s been so long since I seen you.”  Then demanded another round of hugs and kisses!  Even her doctor whom does not normally sign for medical cannabis cards noticed the dramatic improvement saying “I wish all my Alzheimer’s patients were on cannabis.  Look at her quality of life!”  She signs Mom’s renewals no questions asked.  Where everyone I know (even those with huge tolerances) would be stupid asleep or puking on two plus grams of cannabis oil in ten hours; mom has gained cognitive capacity!  Who’d of thought?  I read that CBD’s are the anti seizure cannabinoid so I grew some plants with balanced THC/CBD to see if they can save Mom from seizures and I can add mitigation of seizures to the list of ailments for which she no longer takes western medication.  To date those include asthma arthritic pain agitation and anxiety of Alzheimer’s sleeplessness blood pressure and muscle spasms.  Mom lost another ten pounds from diarrhea trying the different western meds but I have Hippie Chicken hanging and will be extracting her soon.  Hopefully mom will eat then.  (It has become obvious that high CBD strains induce appetite.  She eats well after anti seizure cannabis medication. Hopefully others can watch that tendency to see if this is an isolated response.)  After getting Mom on the high CBD medications we took our time weaning her off anti seizure meds ten days on each reduction with four total reductions.  She did fine during the reduction but the balanced CBD cannabis did not give her the needed behavioral change of psychotic effects of THC so we backed her off to .1 mg per dose in balanced CBD/THC oil and the rest of her cannabis dose in high THC strains.  Once off western anti seizure meds she faired well for nearly three weeks before she seized at which time we adjusted the dosing to try and compensate for the lowered level of CBD in her system.  Just prior to bed we gave her a full gram of balanced CBD/THC oil then again as she slept in the morning such that it would wear off by the time she woke.    Six days later she seized again so we put her on immediate doses of Lorazapam then back on Keppra with liquid Opium to combat the diarrhea.  Next I’d like to try Betane Hydrochloride to aid in digestion for the diarrhea.  Although Mom’s life is limited in length it would be nice if she did not have to take the opiates.  Updates will follow.  For now she is on anti seizure meds opiates for diarrhea cannabis for asthma blood pressure muscle spasms arthritic pain and sleeplessness anxiety aggression of Alzheimer’s.  She weighs 86 pounds at 5’4” now.  She eats and drinks but not enough to sustain.  (Even hippie chicken didn’t work as well as i had hoped.)  But fourteen years after initial symptoms she is mostly happy and loving….as long as she gets her cannabis dose!

When mom was admitted last weekend they found some blood when they were inserting the catheter and called in a Gyn. She also found a little discharge and was going to send it to the lab she was puzzled by it but i can't remember what she thought.       This doc also did an exam and found what she thought might be adhesions and said estrogen cream could help. She was supposed to order a pelvic ulstrasound to see if she could get more info as she was thinking the adhesions might be caused by a prior hysterectomy. I have no idea if mom had one or not though I think she had a tubal ligation. I checked a few days ago after almost a week and it hadn't been done.  Mom has never reported any pain or discomfort ever in that  area and the nursing home never reported an issue either.        I was so creeped out by her exam which I felt was too rough that I told her to hold off on the cream as it has to be put in w an applicator but I found out they are still giving it.  She was ok with holding it either way too.     I'm thinking that the blood they originally found came from putting the catheter in to roughly as it's never been there before.     Does anyone here have their LO on estrogen cream thru the vagina?  This seems in appropriate to me somehow but wanted to check in.  I definitely need to talk to this or another gyn about all of this but curious about your comments.   I know it's not common practice to send eldelry women to GYN doctors.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509474,,,AlzConnected,,,

Thus doing so again.       2 weeks ago Dad fell on our porcelain tile kitchen floor landing on his butt with his head hitting against a lower cabinet. He was not knocked unconscious. He was able to get up with assistance of 2 + walker. No broken hip leg knee or ankle obvious but taken to local Non-Emergency walk-in center. Dad's major complaint was a sore neck. Xrays of cervical upper &amp; lower back &amp; pelvic area xrayed...with no fractures found. Cat Scan of head showed no head injury. But Dr. said there was muscle spasms obviously present. A muscle-relaxer injection was given at the facility &amp; Dad was sent home with 2 prescriptions: Tramadol &amp; Baclofen.      Within 3 days of injury his mental status was deteriorating: restless &amp; picking at covers shaking nearby bedside tray digging at his skin decreased intake &amp; urine output &amp; fecal incontinence. I thought perhaps Dad had a stroke! So we took him to Hospital's Emergency Room. Again xrays &amp; Cat Scan repeated with no fractures nor head injuries found. His labwork revealed Rhabdomyolysis: the rapid destruction of skeletal muscle resulting in leakage into the urine of the muscle protein myoglobin.      Dad was kept in hospital x 4 days with kidney complications related to the hard fall that took muscle injury/pain to a higher level. He was hydrated &amp; followed by neurologist &amp; nephrologist.      With Dad's weakened condition &amp; deteriorated muscle status I knew that I could not take him home from hospital without some type of therapy intervention. So he was transferred to a nursing home rehab unit for Physical-Occupational-Speech Therapies. Dad is not happy with this plan &amp; has lashed out angrily at me for abandoning him taking his money &amp; placing him in home against his will...which is not true. He has become an equal-opportunity offender dissatisfied with every measure of care. Dad feels he's being overworked with all the Therapy: receiving a week's worth of therapy in one day. He's not happy with thickened liquids but Speech therapist said his throat muscles are very weak. I'm not disputing the Therapy plans knowing these areas are not my expertise...yet hoping I'm doing the right thing.     His major complaint is a tender scalp from which he blames the hospital 'barber' for ripping pieces of paper from his scalp. I know he is referring to the EEG which was done while in the hospital. Sadly today I did notice hair missing near his center forehead...&amp; his facial expression DOES reveal pain when area even lightly touched. Questions: 1) is this a common occurrence with EEGs? 2) Is their a topical medication/ointment that would help ease this type of discomfort &amp; promote healing?     The nursing home nurse did not seem concerned with Dad's scalp pain saying area was not red or swollen just missing hair--rather offhandedly/flippantly commenting that she couldn't replace the hair but would give him Tylenol. Dad was not pleased with her insensitivity etc...telling me to bring in Olive Oil tomorrow to place on his sore tender area saying this would offer soothing healing relief. Is this True?     I'm trying to make the best decisions for Dad but still feel overwhelmed with his frustrations negativity &amp; anger...so may not be interpreting everything clearly.     Many thanks for persevering to continue reading my rambling post &amp; for all suggestions &amp; input.     Gratefully   Honey,False,honeydew,2013-12-02,27.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147509480,,,AlzConnected,,,

I felt so awful for her because although she understands things she cannot communicate and keeps her eyes closed 99% of the time. She has no way of letting anyone know she is in pain.     As soon as I returned home I visited her and the spots were drying up except for a few of the larger ones. She was on an antiviral medication and tylenol for the pain that we know she must be experiencing.     She continues to lose weight even though she is still eating soft foods. She has no swallowing issues but is pocketing food.     The last seven years have been heartbreaking as I watched my sweet mom lose everything little by little to the evil Alzheimer's. And only those who have gone through this can understand the emotional pain for both the loved one and their family.

After speaking to a supervisor about my concerns and as this admissions nurse was not going to be my mother's nurse I decided to give them a chance.     Maybe I'm anal but I am starting to have doubts about retaining this group.     My reasons are as follows:  Seem to be a disconnect between the coordinator and actual nursing staff in the field.      Supplies take anywhere from a week to two weeks to arrive with my having to make calls to inquire if they had been ordered. The nurse always just rolls her eyes when I tell her supplies have not arrived and says she doesn't understand why it takes so long. I end up calling the supervisor to expedite.      Nurse never washes her hands prior to touching my mom. She is  not doing anything invasive but really?      Sometimes I have asked questions of the nurse and am left with the feeling that I know more than the nurse. But she is very nice.     My mother has stabilized and there is no expectation that she will be ""leaving"" us anytime soon. Prior to Hospice  she was able to go to her Podiatrist for her diabetic foot care and nail trimming as needed. She has not had her feet professionally examined in over three months . I brought up my concerns regarding the need to have Mom's nails trimmed and wanted to know how it is accommodated now that Mom is in Hospice care. The nurse didn't know but thought that a visiting doctor may come out.     I let it go as she was not having any issue but last night I noticed her toe is inflamed and looks as if she is developing an ingrown toe nail. I called Hospice and explained the situation to the receptionist who transferred me to who I assume is a coordinator. She took the info and passed it on to the nurse.     An hour later I got a call from a woman who shares the same name as my mom's nurse . Only problem is this woman is the secretary for a surgeon. Wrong person.     So back on the phone to Hospice and another message left with the coordinator.  Four hours later with no call back(I do understand an ingrown toe nail is NOT urgent but would like to know what the procedure is in this situation) I re-call and am on hold for 7 minutes before talking to a live person who again transfers me to the coordinator who is not answering her phone. I leave a VM. This is Hospice....... 7 minutes on hold before they even know what the issue is seems a long time especially if someone is calling for a LO who is in extreme pain.      Finally I get a call from my mom's nurse who is having the social worker look into how/what is to be done for my mom's toe. This nurse is supposed to be the case manager for my mom. I guess I'm a little surprised that she would not know how these situations are handled . I'm just surprised in general that this group doesn't have a procedure in place for situations like this.     So fellow caregivers am I totally off base here in wondering if my first impression was in fact the right one? Or am I being totally nuts about these little things?     Thanks for any input.     Logan",False,Logan,2011-12-16,204.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508081,,,AlzConnected,,,

I don't want to talk about it and I just want to sit there in silence. But for some reason I did want to get on here and tell those that understand my grief my pain and my loss.  Maybe the information will help someone else as so many of you have helped me.  Oh for heaven's sake where is my tough girl attitude?  If you find it please kick it back to Florida.  This ""feeling"" thing is for the birds!  I liked it better when I didn't feel or at least I didn't know I did.  Numb made it all much easier.       Anyways the Hospice nurse arrived around 3pm today.  She sat with us for almost 2 hours. Mama was admitted to Hospice care. As of now she will be remaining home where I promised her she would always be.  The team will be coming in this week to assess and make a plan of care. I chose to go with a Hospice physician instead of her primary.  I love her primary but this particular Hospice doctor only takes care of Hospice patients so I felt that would be a better choice.   They will deliver her medications to me. Most of which are covered by medicare under the hospice benefit.  The only medications they may not cover would be her diabetic medications which are free at Publix.  Possibly the synthroid but that is not that expensive.  I will no longer have to pay the additional $400 out of pocket because they get covered under Hospice by medicare. Mama was healthy as a horse when she signed up for medicare and elected not to enroll in drug coverage which I knew nothing about until she got sick.  I am also able to get DME if needed or wanted.  They will send someone to bathe her.  That should be interesting.  They will also send an aid to help out up to three times a week.         I had to sign the DNR today. Not because Hopsice required it but because it was what she wanted.  I struggled to sign it. But I did.  I will explain what happened that gave me peace about it on another post tomorrow.  I just knew that my dad was watching over me and saying ""it was ok to sign it.""     The two main questions that they ask are if they can speak 6 words and if any of her physicians have stated 6 months or less.  I explained that she had a vocabulary bigger than Webster but none of her sentences make sence because it is a ""word salad"".  If you ask my mama a question her answer will be totally unrelated but the sentence may or may not make sense.  As for the 6 months I explained to her that no one is willing to put a time frame on her only to say that she is now end-stage with failure to thrive.  With that she did not hesitate to admit her.      I will keep everyone posted on how it goes this week.  In the meantime mama has now been in briefs for three days because she is loosing control of bowels and urine.       Good night my faithful community of friends. Hugs to everyone~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508437,,,AlzConnected,,,

That went well.  She was kind and reassuring. She handled all the paperwork etc.      The next day was Hospice Central around here.  First the RN came to do the initial assessment and to help decide what my mother needed etc.      Within the same hour the social worker showed up with the chaplain in tow.  They both were wonderful.  Not sure what the role of the social worker is unless just to assess for additional needs or to make sure mama is safe and secure and well taken care of.     Within the next few hours the pharmacy called and brought me all of mama's medications except a few. I'll post about that later because I have need of some opinons/advice.     Then another call came for the CNA to come and bathe mama.  I was horrified at how she would react but I'll be dang skippy....she got up and showered let the CNA do her hair and rub her down with lotion.     Then after that I got another call and they brought her the hospital bed bedside table wheelchair etc. Mama didn't even notice that we had changed her bed from a queen bed to a twin hospital bed.       Then after that the pharmacy called again and brought out more meds for pain/fever etc.     WHEW!  I was exhausted from just having all the extra help.  I'm so grateful but now I am finding it hard to let go and let them because I am always the one to do it all.  I'm sure I'll get use to it but this may take some time for me to adjust too.       ~Mama Bear,False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508499,,,AlzConnected,,,

Kudo's to you for becoming a public figure and taking on the challenge to help so many. There should be more people like you who are willing to do this early on in the process. That is where the change is needed. Prevention and early diagnosis.      Please know that I am not attacking but rather I am giving you back my thoughts on your post. If you were sitting here with me I'd have this conversation face to face with the utmost respect for you as a person fighting for change. The time for change is now this I agree.      ""Are you up for the Truth?""  What truth? My truth is that my LO has a debilitating disease and I am scared out of my wits confused beyond imagination and painfully reminded each day that I cannot change the course of this at the very moment. My mama's brain is gone. What can I do today that will change that and bring her back to have some quality in life? Nothing!        If we had the time the money or the energy I'm sure many of us would jump on the wagon and march to capitol hill. However my focus is on the day to day care of my beloved mother. She is my here and now priority along with my children my husband my animals my home etc.  I would love to put her in a wheelchair and place her face to face with a politician and let them look her in the eye and tell her she doesn't matter. So then I could sock him in the eye and each morning he'd be reminded that she does matter to me. Each time he looked at his beautiful shiner he'd be reminded that she matters to someone.     I find I am offended that you feel you waste your time thumbing through our blogs post etc. What makes you believe we are all the smarter one's and should have a better outlook on life?  My superhero has taken her cape off. She is a mere existence of what she was a year ago. She was included in my future and now I have to undo the beautiful picture of my happy life and rewrite it without my mama in it. I have had my mother's 100th birthday party planned since I was a child. She is only 69. Now I have to let that go because she won't be here.  I have to erase all the plans in my head of ever taking my mama to see the world because she gave me the world as a child.      I understand that you are living life WITH AD.  We here in this portion of the forum are living life trying to HELP someone with AD.  I think it is fair to say that we all feel pain on both sides.  I agree that how we walk down the road makes all the difference in the world.  I walk the road beside my mama. Where she goes I will follow. If she is lost I will help her and along the way she helps me when I am lost. She is the author of her book. She is my teacher I am not hers.      In general I do NOT give a shit what anyone thinks about my world as it is. However my world is isolated with my mama.  This forum gives me comfort in knowing that someone else has walked in similar shoes. It gives me comfort to know that my feelings are valid if some idiot like my uncle makes a judgement call when he hasn't spent one minute in my shoes.  It gives me comfort to know that there ARE other's here who feel my pain who are willing to share their information and give me suggestions when the outside world again...knows NOT what I go through to love my mama right where she is!!!! And I do try to see it from both sides. But Michael it hard to see it from both sides when you are standing with someone who cannot share their thoughts their feelings their needs and their wants.  That is why we come here. To gain knowledge to find support to ask for help. Something all of us need in order to keep marching on down this path side by side with our LO's.     Maybe there are people on this forum who have not been afforded the facts or who have had the physician's feed them lines and paragraphs of BS.  However I have several doctors who have been as clear as they can about my mother's condition as well as her prognosis. She was already an end stage 4 when we got the diagnosis.  There is no BS when I watch my mother repeat her mental health status exam and she scores a 2 which is down 10 points from three months ago.  That is pretty straight forward to me. Behavorial issues...those are pretty straight forward.  I see my beloved mother who was kind loving caring giving and soft spoken yet stronger than any man I know turn into a person who would throw chairs and rip your eyeballs from the sockets.  What choices do I have when all non-invasive non-medicated options run out?       This portion of the website here is the ""caregiver's forum"".  I am certainly not oblivious to the challenges that my mom faces daily.  This particular part of the forum gives us as caregiver's the opportunity to vent our own frustrations to an unforgiving world that knows NOT our struggles as we try our very best to care for our LO's.  Most of us here are not dealing with a high functioning AD patient. Most of here are dealing with LO's who are declining.  We are living in the here and now trying to get through each hour not knowing what the next will bring.      I do not think you are some crazy person with AD.  Who says that people with AD are crazy?  I don't.  What I think is that you have the ability at the moment to march your own road and fight for the cause.  Do it!  I am grateful that you do.  When my focus can shift from the day to day care of my mama then I too will march for change so that maybe the next genertion will not have to go through what I now do.       ~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508558,,,AlzConnected,,,

As I mentioned in another post she went about 3 years without treatment after diagnosis because she refused to go to the doctor.  We were noticing the memory issues and she just wrote it off as ""Everyone does that as they get older.""  Of course we knew it was more than normal aging.  Even her 90 year old aunt asked us if she had Alzheimer's.  She ended up in the hospital in 2009 for chest pain due to anxiety and while she was there we got a Neurology consult and he put her on Aricept.  Unfortunately it made her very ill and she went off it.  She refused to go back to the doctor because ""My grandfather was senile (in the 50s) and there's nothing they can do about it."" and ""I'm fine.  You girls are just trying to make me crazy.""  That last statement was very out of character for her so it just proved the diagnosis.  Fast forward two years later and she ended up in the hospital again for what they think was a TIA.  The Neurologist put her on Namenda followed by Aricept a few months later.  She took both of them for about 18 months but then refused to go to the doctor again to get them renewed.  Finally at our request one of her same age friends sat her down and told her that the issues she was experiencing were not normal aging.  Between that and us insisting that she was going to go back to the doctor on her own or we were going to go to court to get DPOA (which she has refused to do) we finally got back to the doctor and she is on Namenda and Aricept again.  She tried the Exelon patch but could never remember to change it and gets very upset if my sister or I remind her of something that she things she remembers.  The Exelon pills made her extremely ill way worse than Aricept had done in the beginning so she went back on Aricept.        I feel guilty because I read what some of you are dealing with and my life is still pretty easy in comparison.  Even so I get frustrated when I have to answer the same question 3 or 4 times in a 30 minute period.  I try not to snap but she can tell by my face the third or fourth time that I'm frustrated.  I keep telling myself that this is the easy part of this disease but I'm human.  What can I say?         My fear is that her physical condition is great and that her brain will shut down long before her body follows suit.  Not that I'm wishing for her to die young but I hope you know what I mean.  Her mother lived to 100 with very few memory issues until she was about 97.  Even then she could follow a conversation she just might not remember it later.

I don't know if this is some sort of decline she has been diagnosed for at least 10 years now or if it's just the meds. My poor niece is her only visitor and caregiver.

She can't be in a hard cast so they've just immobilized it and it will heal over the next 8 weeks and they are giving her plenty of pain killers but I just feel so bad she has to deal with this on top of everything else. We've upped her fall prevention plan with the facility and I got one of the weight-sensing bed alarms with the cordless alarm the CGs can carry (they had the 'clip' kind but since with that one the alarm sounds in her room I was concerned that 1) it would scare the crap out of her and 2) if the CGs were far enough down the hall they might not hear it immediately. Meanwhile since she is left handed she has to be hand-fed and I'm betting by the time her arm is better she may have forgotten how to use it for eating anyway. The nurse practitioner told me that one reason that ALZ patients tend to be so badly injured when they fall is that they have lost their ability to remember to 'save themselves' and fall to minimize injury that we all take for granted - they just go DOWN.

I go over to their house everyday and try to give my mom a break since she still works full time - mostly from home.(she's 55 i'm 2   The term/condition ""APHASIA"" has recently been introduced to us. Which it makes complete sense because my dad rarely completes a sentence. He'll repeat the first few words over and over... then just give up. We try to help slowly suggesting what might be on his mind (what we have recently discussed around him or with him) but he gets snappy with us. So we end up changing the subject.     Anyways The main point to this is that he is unable to communicate. You can ask him something (anything) and he usually says ""that's fine"" or ""yeah"" even if the question didn't require an answer like that. So its hard to tell if he is in pain or upset or anything at all.     Yesterday he was leaned to the side while standing and stumbling when trying to walk. I think thats a sign of a stroke? His face wasn't paralyzed he didnt complain of a headache he can't really ever pick up small objects - doesn't follow direction very well       We are at a loss of how to handle this? Today he is still somewhat leaned to the side. Do we take him to the hospital? Where he wont be able to communicate what he is thinking or feeling to the doctors?      Its heartbreaking.

My mom gets 3900 mg every day. (max daily dose of XTRA Strength Tylenol Arthritis is 4000mg.  Max dose of regular Tylenol is 3000 mg. I went to the drugstore and read the labels.)       I'm also not totally convinced my mother needs this much.  She's been on this much for about a year now. I talk to her nurses regularly and it seems the only time she has some pain or stiffness is getting out of bed in the morning.  Every now and then she might have a little pain or soreness after walking with restorative therapy aides for example but it doesn't continue.  For various reasons I've held off on discussing this with her doctor but would like to get as much information as possible before I do. ( I was very confused when the doctor increased her dosage this high last year as nursing and I didn't notice an increase in pain facial grimacing etc. I suspect when you probe  she might say "" Oh I hurt all over..and smiles at you."" but she participates fully in everything and doesn't occur like someone who has pain except in the morning or as I said she occasionally volunteers it but it's a fluctuating thing. )     So this continues to gnaw at me a bit and I do worry about the effects of this on mom's liver over time. I know the liver is the thing to worry about here and her recent liver labs have been normal except for the alkaline phosphotase.( Her doctor ran further studies to determine the cuase of that level and found that it wasn't her liver- the test is called the 5 nucleotybase?  She thinks this has something to do with bone or muscle deterioration( can't remember which one. Mom does have arthritis and osteoporosis so this does make sense to me.    Does anyone have experience with liver issues with their loved one and/or with Tylenol?    I would like to get some other opinions on this before talking to the doctor. I've even thought about getting another doctor's opinion first but if anyone here has insight in to how common this is or knowledge of safety i'd appreciate it. I think it's better when you have a concern to be thorough in learning about it and not just rely on once source.  My plan is to then call her doctor and see what she thinks about risks etc and discuss her thoughts about a short term trial of reducing Tylenol to see what happens.  ( I know the pharmacy affiliated with Mom's nursing home sends has flagged her dose and the doctor or admin have to sign off saying it's okay to continue.)     I just would like to get some peace of mind about this.  In the past mom has been taken off meds that were no longer necessary and given she takes SO many I think its' prudent to look at this.      Thanks for any input!",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507925,,,AlzConnected,,,

1044,621087107b65de9a5b672d7a,2147508021,2014-07-28 01:51:00,Introduction and a question,"Hello all -   I'm new here and after my third straight night of no sleep I found myself on the computer looking for answers and stumbled across this site. My current state of exhaustion might cause me to ramble a bit.  My mother and I take care of my grandmother (in her home). She's 84 and until a year ago when she had a seizure in July 2013 was still mentally sound. She had her 'senior-moments' before that but for anyone in their 80s that is to be expected.   A few months after her seizure she had a surgery to treat her PVD and contracted MRSA; 12 hours after ambulatory surgery (ie: we were home by then) in the course of a half hour she went from stable and 98.0 temp to 105.3. It took the hospital 2 weeks to completely keep her fever down and isolate the infection; but by that point the mental damage had been done.  Even after the seizure she was pretty in control of her mental faculties - it would just be interspersed with episodes of confusion. After the near sepsis/MRSA she was in a state of near total confusion - interspersed with moments of lucidity.   In October 2013 she was released into a nursing care/rehab facility to finish her medication regime and do physical therapy and because she could still walk at that point they placed a 'wander-alarm' on her ankle without and padding (ignoring her PVD) and no matter how often we asked them to move it (or pad it at least) the next day it was back in the same place. It cut her ankle about 2 cm and due to her circulation issues the cut grew to 14 cm and as a result she could no longer walk from the pain.  3 more vascular surgeries followed and more stays in various rehabs until she was released home (ie: the skilled nursing coverage insurance ran out) in March 2014.  The first two months were fine. She readjusted to being home very well; despite the fact that we had to move her from her 3rd floor bedroom and turn the den into a room for her to stay in. She took her medications. She was calm cool and collected.   The last three months however have seemingly spiraled out of control and I have no idea why. Since early-May she has gotten insolent and violent (and I'm sort of ashamed to say it but it's shockingly closer to her pre-illness personality). She doesn't sleep at night she bites when we're trying to give her medications she hits and scratches...etc. etc.  Example - Three days ago she clamped down on my mother's hand so hard that I had to actually pry her mouth open. She then turns to me with an evil smirk on her face and says ""I'm going to tell the nurse you hit me in the face. They'll take you away and lock you up so fast your head will spin."" It was interspersed with foul language. I also get accused of being 'disgusting' and 'perverted' every single time I change her diaper. I'm a 'failure of a human being' for being unmarried and without children at 30; despite the fact that I haven't had time to go out socially in almost 2 years. It just goes on and on.  And as much as I know I can't take any of it personally - that it's just the disease (and the fact that honestly she wasn't a very nice person to begin with) talking - I am reaching the end of my rope. No one else in the family helps me and my mother (and she has her own issues with depression and anxiety on top of all of this that I have to deal with).      Anyway - enough rambling. The question I had is fairly benign after all of that: Is fixation normal? And by fixation I mean obsessing over something for hours on end. The last three days my grandmother has been convinced that she has all of this laundry and fold and hang up. She'll stop talking about it for a half hour or so and then get back on the subject. I've tried giving her the actual clean laundry I had just done to fold...thinking it would calm her...and got it literally thrown at me because it wasn't the 'right' laundry. This has happened with other things and I have no idea how to fix it or get her attention on something else.",False,blynn1,2014-07-28,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508021,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have a mother recently diagnosed with AD after being arrested for harassing the neighbor one too many times.  The neighbor was tired of my mother not taking care of her yard or house.  Even though my mother remembered having this order of protection ( she told me every time on the phone) she violated it and spent 4 nights in jail. The court denied her bond and forced for for evaluation which was a blessing as she never would go to the doctors to check on what we thought was depression. She was diagnosed and was told she needed to live in 24/7 assisted living. My grandmother had the same thing but we just called it dementia back then. She remembers going through this with her mom but needless to say she isn't on board with this. We have told her it was temporary and she just needs to get better.     Anyway mom is always a bit of a ""cougar"" type and has been obsessed with a man in his 40's for years despite trying to rationalize with her. She really feels she is in her 20's and even before the diagnosis often handles things in an adolescent way. She despises ""old people"" and has been clear about that for many many years before all this happened.     We moved her into an amazing facility that is both independent and assisted living with a memory care staff. The place is very expensive and she has her own studio with full kitchen bath. However she is the youngest person there so this is her own personal hell. When we ate dinner together she just gasped and said out loud ""GINA look at all these OLD people!"" I felt horrified because this was her new neighbors and I don't want them to not like her.     I have tried rationalizing which I am sure everyone has done here. I lie and say she can't go home ""yet"" she forgets and asks again in about an hour if I am with her or calls on the phone. She complains she feels ancient and no matter what I do she seems to be miserable.      So in a nutshell she already had a bad attitude about anyone over 50 and now she is just complaining non stop. If it isn't the old people topic it is her going home. Today she called and said ""I just need to go home one more time to get some things"" Her house is like something out a horror film so that will not be happening.      Not sure if this is a question per se but has anyone else had a parent that just doesn't fit in to the community of assisted living? I feel she is really young compared to the others there but there isn't anything I can say other than there are no places with 20 and 30 year olds who have memory problems we could find! She apparently is somewhat social during morning and afternoons...but I can just feel her pain and it is so difficult to repeat the same statements over and over.       ThanksG",False,Gina H,2014-08-02,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147508165,,,AlzConnected,,,

And now since I have the luxury of 20/20 Hindsight I can see hints and red flags from all the way back to 2005.  Things have progressed/regressed over the last 6-8 months to the point that I was forced to go to court to obtain a Guardianship over her because I couldn't even talk her into going to visit with her family doctor. Not to mention the fact that she had stopped taking all her medication one being for high blood pressure and she had always been religious about taking.  After getting the Guardianship it seemed that everything was just falling into place like a kid playing with dominoes. Temporary Guardianship was awarded by the court got her into the hospital for her mandatory 3-day ""acute"" stay and the local nursing home had an opening even though they usually have a waiting list a mile long.  I knew she would hate the nursing home. I hated the nursing home. But I'm divorced the only child no other family members are willing to help with her care and she wanders.   She lives/lived in a rural area on an old country road where no one has heard of speed limits or respects the fact that there are two lanes or people might be walking. She has walked to my house (3 miles) had numerous calls to police about concern for her safety and I've had people come to my house telling me they had seen her on the road.   If the wandering wasn't bad enough even though I was going every day to cook for her and make sure she was okay she was attempting to cook for herself and the multitude of cats she has taken in. (Literally inside the house. I may never get it cleaned.) And she almost burned down her small trailer several times because of forgetting she had the stove on putting plastic items in the oven and melting them or catching her teakettle on fire because of splashed grease.  That isn't even taking into consideration the fact that as Ned Stark would say Winter is Coming and she doesn't know how to use the thermostat for the heater anymore or the fact that she doesn't have and has never had running water. (Yes there are still people who live without what most of us would call a 'necessity of life'.)  Finally in desperation I did the thing I never wanted to do.   I had her placed in a nursing home. For her safety and my sanity.  She stayed in the local nursing home for a week then started having ""issues"". They told me it was fine that she wandered there. The main doors and office doors were locked and she wouldn't be on the highway. So she wandered into other residents' rooms.   I got a call Thursday afternoon saying that she has had a bathroom incident on the floor of another resident's room and on the bed in another room. And they said that was considered an ""unacceptable behavioral issue"" and that she would have to leave. She would have to go to a hospital set up to handle patients with behavioral problems for an evaluation before they would even consider allowing her to come back.  So she's taken to a hospital given a urine test and comes back with a strong UTI result. 4.1 the nurse tells me which she says is very high. They're trying to treat her with antibiotics and she's resisting of course.   I found out yesterday when I visited. that she tried to hit one nurse and pushed another and had another accident in the floor. She apparently doesn't sleep much at night so she slept during my entire visit except for the few words she spoke to me to let me know that I obviously didn't care about her or I wouldn't be treating her this way.  I know it's a good thing that she acted out otherwise we wouldn't have known about the UTI. And maybe it's a good thing if the local NH won't take her back because she didn't like it and neither did I and I'm still upset that they just tossed all her belongings into a cardboard box and I'm almost certain I didn't get everything back. Maybe this is just a stepping stone to getting her somewhere where maybe she can be safe and comfortable.  I just feel so guilty for having to take her somewhere where she doesn't know anyone. And I know she hates being expected to do things she doesn't want to do. And I know she hates even more the fact that she can't move around as much as she wants. Most of all I hate that I've had to uproot her from the home she's lived in for the last 60+ years and taken her to a new confusing and unknown area.  I know I'm doing it all because I want her safe but it doesn't feel that way at the moment. I have this terror that when the UTI clears up there won't be an opening at any of the facilities close by and she will have to go so far away that I can't get to see her except on the weekends when I'm not working.   My guilt and pain are extreme right now.

Thank goodness she didn't have to go to the hospital for this.  She's physically much much better but had one or two days where she was very grumpy and tried to hit her aide in the morning.  After that though the rest of her day she was just fine.  Today however day 9 when I saw her at 4pm she was sure someone had stolen some things from her and had changed her clocks. Her door was closed when I came into her room and she wanted it closed so she could tell me about these things.     Fortunately her disposition was still very sweet and happy and she was redirectable but it was unnerving as mom has had a long difficulty history with paranoia and other psychotic issues.    She also had some intense pain in her feet and overall body a few days ago beyond her usual baseline and she's seemed extra confused as well.     Yesterday was a different story totally lovely no pain or paranoia.     I read the warnings and side effects about Levaquin and it really got my back up. I found out from a medical journal that's  it's not generally recommended as the first course of treatment for infections because of these side effects especially in the elderly.  It can cause all kinds of medical issues as well as central nervous system issues.    I'm really hoping that today was a fleeting thing but I'd be curious to know if others experienced problems with this med.  I also want to talk to her doctors and the nursing home about this.  Given her history it's a little upsetting to see that this was prescribed.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507315,,,AlzConnected,,,

According to the staff at the nursing home she started to struggle a bit to breathe and before they were able to get oxygen to her my mom took her last breath.  The last 6 months have truly been a rough period for everyone involved.    In January she was sent to a behavioral unit by the ALF for refusing to re-enter the building due to a severe anxiety attack.  She stayed there for 2 weeks and returned to the ALF only to be sent back 9 days later for the same thing.  Because of this the staff at the ALF asked me to remove her because they weren't able to give her the care she needed (even though they advertised as being an Alzheimer's care facility). I was lucky enough to quickly find her another facility a few miles down the road but had told my sister in MD I wouldn't be able to keep her in the second ALF because it was more expensive.  At the end of March my sister came and took my mom to MD and moved her into the house.  The first week my mom responded well to the new surroundings but after that things went downhill.  About 6 weeks later my mom fell down the steps in the house and fractured her pelvis and leg.  She was in the hospital for a few weeks then transferred to rehab.  After 2 separate trips to the ER due to UTI's dehydration and weight loss (due to refusing to eat or drink anything) she rapidly slipped away from us.  The case worker stated it seemed like my mom went from stage 3 dementia to stage 6 in only a few months.  My mom wouldn't open her eyes much or talk and would just sit in her wheelchair at the nurses station most of the day.  We felt she was trying to tell us that the end was near and only 2 weeks later she was gone.  I was able to see her the day after she passed (there won't be a viewing/service and she will be cremated per her wishes) and said my goodbyes. Seeing her lie there crushed me like nothing else.  I lost my dad 11 years ago this month and now I've lost my mom in the same month.  The most important thing is my mom is no longer in pain and she is at peace. I don't believe in God and feel when you die there is nothing else but for my mom's sake I hope she's with her parents and siblings where she's always wanted to be.    I want to thank everyone here that gave me words of encouragement.  I wouldn't have been able to get through this without you.  I'll continue to peek in and hopefully be able to offer encouragement to others who need it.,False,pepcaone,2013-02-25,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507557,,,AlzConnected,,,

Last night they called and said she was vomitting blood cold and clammy and staring into space and asked if it would be ok to take her to the ER/hosp. This was at almost 1 am and I said okay...     We have not had an official explanation or diagnosis from the hospital other than she was dehydrated and has the diarrhea. Her BP (blood pressure) was 60/40. They put her on some IV fluids and her body responded and her BP went up a but into a better number. I did not realize her LW (living will) says she wants no iv's or life sustaining measures nothing invasive no IV fluids...      Tonight when I went to visit her BP was 60/32. Back down again. Dad (her POA) called the hosp earlier tonight to tell them she did not want the IV's per her living will. When I was visiting tonight she had a breathing tube. Her living will specifies: ""I do not want mechanical respiration by machine when my brain can no longer sustain my own breathing""..so does this include a breathing tube/oxygen..?      Dad does not want to prolong her agony any longer she has suffered all total about 6 years with this disease and he feels they are prolonging the agony...      So my question is do we ask that the breathing tubes be removed..? The hospital has a copy of her living will and dad even read the highlighted parts to them tonight because they were not following it even after we told them to. But even after him calling and reading the LW (which they have a copy of) she has a breathing tube. My question is is this breathing tube go against her wishes as outlined by the quoted statement above..? I feel like a horriblde monster if we ask that they remove it. But I guess at this point things are causing her more pain that doing her good (even eating the NH switched her to a diet of oral liquids because her body was beginning to reject solid foods)...     The gastroenteroligist declined to do an endoscopy that the hospital doctor requested because he felt it would hurt her more than help her.

Then he started bloating and had swollen legs/feet can't button his pants. I think Mom was expecting him to get more medical care than they were delivering because it took her a while to realize that SHE is the one who had to take care of this.  Mom finally got him to the doctor. He has a UTI but the edema didn't go away when he started taking his antibiotics.       This week he had a CT scan which shows a Renal Cell Carcinoma. I don't know the full scoop yet...he has been referred to a urologist. But the doctor mentioned cyber knife radiology as an option.    Mom said the CT scan was a challenge and we are having a hard time imagining putting him through ANY sort of surgical procedure.     How do you explain a surgical wound to someone who won't remember why it is there every day when he wakes up?????? We worked so long and hard to get him moved and away from my Mom that we hadn't even THOUGHT about what it would be like to nurse him with a physical ailment.    Pure coincidence that he got moved right as this happened. I'm thrilled to pieces that the nurse is now in charge of dad's meds because Mom never did seem to get anything right. That is the best case scenario for his care right now.

Does anyone have any good resources on this topic to suggest?  I know that General Anesthesia is out of the question but i'm almost afraid they'll say ""Oh we have all these other less invasive options you should try"" when in reality I really want to do nothing but keep him pain free.    We have noted in the past that the general medical community really has no clue about alzheimers.  When he was in the hospital with pneumonia they had no understanding of what his limitations were.  We have also noticed that the MD neurologist and other doctors don't coordinate efforts at all and communication amongst them is poor.         my brother is going to the urologists appt tomorrow and they just happen to have an appt with the neurologist on tuesday.  No mention of an oncologist yet.  I don't know if that means they are SURE from the MRI that it has not metastasized yet or if the urologist makes that call.           Advice is appreciated!",False,librarysue,2011-12-16,26.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507616,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was committing medicare fraud and I caught it and reported her and took mom out of her office immediately. There were other issues too.     We took mom to a new psychiatrist today. We loved him.  I couldn't believe that my mother actually responded quite well to him. I would say an older gentlemen in his 60's but very soft spoken and treated her as a person not a patient.  I am an R.N. so I am very in tune to the way providers act towards their patients. I tend to be a little more aggressive toward them if they treat her any other way than as a person with a disability who needs love compassion and support.       We discussed at length the issues with not sleeping more than 30 minutes several times a day and its 24/7.  He has suggested that we increase the Trazadone by 25mg per night until we find a comfortable level without any added delirium.  If this doesn't work then he will add some Seroquel.  He couldn't believe that mom was able to tolerate the 150mg and still pace as though she had three pots of coffee because she is also on remeron and risperidone at night.  As I always tell them ""You haven't met my mother"". God love her!       Her appetite is still up and she is happy for the moment. All seems to be going well.  Except that on her visit to neuro in April she scored a 12 on the MMSE.  A few weeks back she only scored a 2. We are probably beginning the severe stage.  The other thing I'm noting is that she keeps saying my dad told her to follow him but she can't figure out where he went.  My father passed 34 years ago.  So either he is visiting to check on her or he is coming to take her home with him.  I'm ok either way.  I love my mom but I do not want her to suffer and I know that her last breath here on earth will free her from this horrible disease.      Love and hugs to all~Mama Bear",False,mamabear0128,2014-02-23,207.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507838,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am joining in order to get some help for both my fiancée Kerri as well as her grandmother Elsie. Kerri is 32 years old and was raised solely by her grandmother.  Elsie is showing some signs of some sort of dementia but is of course in complete denial about that or any other health issues.  She is 87 years old and also suffers from sever rheumatoid arthritis in her hands and feet (her wrists look like she has a tennis ball under her skin and her feet are curled around with her toes overlapping each other.)  She is also suffering from minor hearing loss although claims that everyone just whispers too much (note I am often told that I speak to loudly by everybody else.)     Kerri has two aunts one of which lives 5 minutes away but might as well not exist as she doesn't seem to have any care about talking to her mother almost ever; the other aunt lives in New England is about a 5 hour drive from us.  Due to the problems with her hands and feet it is a major chore to try and take her out of the house so she simply refuses to go out. This includes going to the doctor which she outright refuses to do for fear that they will cause her more problems then she already has.  Due to this Kerri does all of the housework all of the shopping and all of the cooking. Despite all of this Elsie is often angry towards Kerri accusing her of not caring about her not doing anything around the house calling her lazy criticizing her weight problems if there is something to complain about she will find it and if there is nothing to complain about well she'll complain anyway.     As these problems worsen I have been trying to get Kerri to join a support group but she says she is uncomfortable with it. She doesn't believe that anybody can understand what she is going through partly because she believes that she may be the only person in our age group who are in a position such as hers. I assured her that age doesn't really factor in as whether you are the child or grandchild 32 years old or 62 years old the pain is just as real and the problems can get just as bad. Add on that again being the sole caregiver for Kerri for so many years having given birth to her or not Elsie is the only true parent Kerri has ever had.       I also think that Kerri is ashamed of letting things get so bad feeling that 1) she should have pushed Elsie to get medical help much sooner and 2) she has taken so much verbal abuse over the last couple years that she is so beyond the breaking point that she cannot see any possible positive future anymore.    It pains me to see the person I love in so much pain and so here I am getting the ball rolling seeking some advice looking for people in similar positions and praying that I can prove to her that she needs help from someone other than just myself. I'm also hoping that once she sees these message boards I can finally get her involved down the line.     I'd like to thank everyone in advance for any help you may be able to offer and I look forward to sharing stories and learning more so that I can help not only Kerri but Elsie as well.,False,czuck1983,2014-06-11,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147506864,,,AlzConnected,,,

I continue to learn so much from everyone's posts.      My dad has Vascular Dementia and my husband's dad has ALZ. Our dads' diseases are very different with very different behaviors family situations resources etc. We live on the opposite coast of our families so we do share the  problem of dealing with everything from a great distance.     FIL is 90 and probably around end of stage 6. He has been overall a very ""good"" patient with very little agitation or difficult behaviors. MIL (84 a former nurse) has been his primary caretaker for about 4 years and they now have round-the-clock aides. FIL has had a catheter for some time now.     Yesterday we got a call that he was very weak with a high fever (102). They tried giving him Tylenol but he couldn't or wouldn't take it so they finally called an ambulance and he was admitted to the hospital. Sister-in-Law told my husband he should get on a plane NOW because FIL was fading.     I just dropped husband at the airport and when I got home I called SIL for an update. She said FIL's fever is down a little bit. They think he has a bad UTI (probably from the catheter). They will treat him with antibiotics and keep him in the hospital for another day or so. I think it's still good that my husband is going - his mom and sister can use his help - but it seems it may not be as dire as SIL thought. Husband had planned to go next month anyway.     I guess my question which I know no one can really answer is - when do you know when the ""end"" is near? I told husband that from everything I have read on the forums it may be time for them to call in hospice. I explained that it's not just for the last few days but could be very helpful for this type of situation and offer MIL and SIL a lot of support. Taking FIL to the hospital seems like it's almost prolonging the inevitable and could be overly traumatic to someone with ALZ.     It's delicate because I don't want to sound like I'm saying to them ""Let him go."" He's 90 his body is just failing more and more but on the other hand he still knows his family still asks about me and seems fairly content. He mostly just sleeps or sits in his chair and sings or whispers conversations to God (he is/was a minister.) My husband's sense is that FIL is ""getting ready to go.""     Of course I would never say this to my MIL. She has taken excellent care of him. I think she will keep fighting to keep him alive keep taking him to the hospital for every infection every time. Does there come a time when it's kinder to say ""Let's ease his pain but let him go?""     I know this is not my decision and I would never have this conversation with my MIL or my SIL only with my husband.

So I offered today and he seemed grateful. I suppose I should look at them once a month. I also clean his hearing aids.         It's late now and my mind is going in strange directions. I got to thinking about how I used to cut my kids' nails when they were babies. Now that's a terrifying experience let me tell you!

Unbelievable Speed of Decline,I last posted regarding my mother's rapid onset of losing the ability to walk due to what we thought was a bout with a virus. I had contacted my mom's PCP when she had developed a very wet sounding cough and he had advised Robitussin DM. Gave Mom two doses and she started to improve and regain her walking ability. In fact not only did Mom seem to get better she actually returned to a stage we had seen two years ago. Her PCP thought it was probably due to the ingredient in the Robitussin ( I don't recall the name ... it's the DM .. I think).     Long story short: It didn't last long at all . I had the gift of two days were I was able to get Mom out and around to various stores and she actually enjoyed herself.     A return to her normal level of functioning followed and then a rapid onset of her cough and lost ability to walk. I took Mom to the ER on Wednesday afternoon where she was admitted with a suspected case of Bronchitis per the ER Dr.. Her temperature was 99.1  not considered anything to be concerned with and her lungs showed no Pneumonia but she was started on a round of antibiotics to help prevent a worsening. Her urine was also clean.     On Thursday morning I met with Mom's attending physician who went over Mom's symptoms and the fact that no actual infection was found. She very gently told me that Mom is actually in the end stage of dementia and the cough is from Mom's inability to effectively handle her body secretions. Her swallowing centers have been impaired. I knew this was coming just not this rapidly. Literally a major shift in Mom's abilities from one day to the next if you look at the rapidity of the original onset of symptoms.     Mom was discharged last Friday into Hospice care at home. We are still getting settled into the new routine and am waiting for a call from the nurse who has been assigned to Mom. The Hospice admitting nurse met us at the house Friday within 45 min of Mom's discharge and an aide came out yesterday to bathe Mom. So far so good.     Since Friday Mom can no longer sit without being propped up she is sleeping about 21 hours a day and I noticed last evening her ability to smile is fast disappearing. Only her eyes seem to have expression in them .I hope what I see is trust and I hope she is not aware of how her body is slowly shutting down. She does not seem to a have any pain. That I am so grateful for and hope it remains so.      As I write this tears are springing out of mine which over the last few days happens quite frequently. I haven't felt this sense of loss since we first heard the diagnosis eight years ago.      I pray for a quick end for my mother's battle with this disease and I pray for the emotional strength and grace to help ease her journey.,False,Logan,2011-12-16,204.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147506961,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have always been a stay at home mom so I am his primary caregiver. My husband only has one brother who is not really involved with the family. I came from a large family of five kids and my father passed away three years ago after a twelve and a half year battle with aneurysms. My whole family was involved when Dad was sick.  When we took my FIL in my family plus my two adult children and my teenager still at home were all so supportive and assured me that my FIL was welcome where ever I was and that our family would be the same. Here I sit two months later feeling lonlier than I ever have. It seems as if most of my family is avoiding me. When I do talk to them I don't bring up my FIL unless asked about him. Because honestly sometimes I want to know that there is more going on in the world than the craziness of dementia in my household. They seem to be very short with me and don't talk much. Or seem angry. My adult daughter has come out and told me that she thinks I should put him in a home because she thinks it's too much for me. Now she rarely talks to me and is very short tempered when she does. She doesn't have the patience for my FIL talking loudly and radomly like a dementia person does. My husband and my two sons are my entire support system lately. But I know this is hard on them too so I hate to put it all on them.      I just really needed to vent a bit. Thank you for listening(reading)! Sometimes it's hard to share the hurt with my guys because it's family that has caused the pain.       After today's work day my husband will be on vacation for two weeks. We plan on cleaning out my FIL house and putting it on the market. My adult son is planning on coming and sitting at the house for a whole day so that my husband and I can have a day off together.  This will be the FIRST break we have had since he moved in.  I know there are respite homes but he is terrified we will leave him there. Hopefully this works out with my son since it is someone he knows (even though he can't remember his name). And we can graduate to an overnight break.              Thanks again for letting me vent I really needed that!

1078,62108a937b65de9a5b673cd4,2147507231,2014-06-27 12:20:00,Broken Tooth,I've seen a few posts on the diffculty in getting dental treatment for advanced dementia patients. We've struggled (successfully so far) in even getting my mom's teeth cleaned regularly. Well last Saturday I was having lunch with my mom and I saw something drop out of her mouth. I snatched it up and saw it was one of her crowns. We made an appointment with the dentist to have it cemented back on but when I took a closer look the entire tooth was broken off inside the crown! She is not in any pain thank goodness (I guess the root is dead). We took her in to the dentist but she cannot follow directions to even open her mouth so it was almost impossible for them to even see what was going on. My husband and I had to hold her hand and the x-ray thingy for them to take x-rays (and got two zaps of radiation each as a prize). Then they said well there was no way they could deal with it and referred us to an oral surgeon. I called his office this morning after explaning the situation they said they couldn't handle it either and referred us to another surgeon. His answer service then said he couldn't do it either and transferred us to yet another one. The third surgeon's office at least will see us next week.  They are going to have to sedate her or knock her out which will I'm sure have an adverse effect on her dementia but I can't just leave the tooth and root fragments in her mouth I'm afraid that the skin will grow over it and then infection will set in. One more thing to deal with. :/,False,msashley64,2013-03-14,348.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507231,,,AlzConnected,,,
1079,62108aab7b65de9a5b673d33,2147507037,2014-06-19 09:12:00,Mom has passed(2),"My husband and I were called to the hospital at 2am on Monday night.  We packed fast jumped in the car and made the 1 hour drive over there.  When we arrived my mother's BP which had been faltering went back up and stabilized.  After 2 hours my husband and I decided to check into a hotel that is a block from the hospital to get some sleep and told the nurse and caregiver to call us  immediately if anything changed and we'd come right back.  By this time mom was not responsive but she was peaceful and her vitals were stable.  The next morning dad called me after 10am.  I knew mom was still alive as I had just talked to the caregiver and dad's caregiver had arrived so I told him that mom was not doing well and  suggested he come on down to the hospital when he could.  My husband and I got dressed had breakfast and went over to the hospital.  I had let the owner of the company know what was going on and nearly all of mom's caregivers arrived at the hospital within a short time.  Most of them came on their own time to be with mom at the end. The nephrologist arrived and told us there was nothing more that could be done.  Mom's BP was no longer registering although she had a heartbeat and pulse. Mom's GP came and I thanked him for all of his help and told him that I truly believe mom would not have lived this long had it not been for him.  I instructed the doctor to go to comfort measures and requested hospice.  Before the nurse unhooked mom from the machines I made sure the doctor had prescribed morphine in case mom went into distress.  Then she was unhooked from the IV's. The hospital chaplain arrived and asked about mom and I told him that not only had mom given me life but that when I was 3 she saved my life because I almost choked to death on a hard candy a saleslady in a dress store gave me meaning to be kind  and I was turning blue when mom grabbed me flipped me upside down and hit me hard on the back to make me expel the candy (this was in the 1960's almost 10 years before the Heimlich Maneuver was known.)  This is my first memory of my mother.  Little did I know at the time that my life was NOT the only life mom had saved and that over the years I would see her save other people's lives over and over again as well as help people with all kinds of injuries and I learned the skills she had from carefully observing her..  Even though I have no formal medical training I learned so much from my mother that I have been able to ""pay if forward"" helping others many times in my life. The chaplain prayed for mom and our family and mom passed gently during the prayer.         Hospice arrived about 15 minutes after mom passed.  Dad said he always thought that he would die before mom.  I said ""Oh dad you know how competitive mom is.  Did you really think she was going to let you beat her at anything?""  and he laughed because that is so true.         On our return to my parents house after mom's death I immediately donated all of our extra supplies (diapers rubber gloves depends dry shampoo supplies for bed baths  etc.) to our caregiver company to make ""care packages"" for their other clients.  When dad saw me do this he remarked ""She's just like her mother.""  Because we both know that was exactly what mom would have done.        I have continued dad's caregivers in the home from 10am to 9pm seven days a week. He is stuck with his personal trainer whether he likes it or not.           We are having a family only internment ceremony at the mausoleum this week and then in a week a celebration of mom' life at her beloved country club.         As I prepared to write mom's obituary I was looking for a photo and happened across a document she wrote describing her entire life from the time she was born until 1974. Here laid out for us was her complete life story all the places she had gone to school and where she had worked and all the different places she and my father ever lived and the time mom took up golf and broke 100 and 90 and won Most Improved Golfer in her first year of playing golf.   Dad and I had no idea she had written this but how like my mother to make sure I had ALL the facts right at the right time with the least amount of trouble.  I finished the obituary with the story of mom's achieving a 7 handicap winning many golf tournaments becoming President of the Ladies Golf Association and finally revealed her famous secret recipe for Vermicelli al la Vongole - something everyone who knew her was lucky enough to eat at one of her dinner parties a recipe she learned in Naples Italy that was a closely guarded family secret.  A final gift from her to her friends.          Mom's journey through dementia was incredibly fast.  She was diagnosed in December 2011. I am so very grateful to all the wonderful caring people who helped us through this journey from doctors to caregivers and the kind people at the country club who compassionately tolerated mom's unpredictable behavior as she declined and the many wonderful people here on this message board who educated me and helped me find a way to help my mother as much as possible through this disease. I am grateful that mom did not have to live with a feeding tube nor languish in bed for years unable to do anything and that God saw fit to take her quickly and gently so that she didn't have to suffer and that she didn't know what was happening to her at the end which was perfect for her.  In her death there was no fear no pain  only peace.  This is proof of God's grace in her life. Before mom became unresponsive I told mom ""I love you "" and mom's last words to me were ""I love you.""  And in the end that's all that really matters.        Many thanks to everyone here for helping me to help my mom.  Your knowledge and advice has been a great gift to me and my family that I will cherish forever.",False,MacyRose,2011-12-15,3982.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147507037,,,AlzConnected,,,

It started with a virus then when that was gone she fell on the steps and bruised her tailbone. She's had a couple of X-rays and no fracture is showing but I've been down this road before and have insisted on a ct or bone scan this time.  Her doc's office finally agreed to schedule a ct but it's been two weeks and I'm still waiting.         She has osteoporosis.         (Once she had a broken vertebra for about 10 months before a bone scan was done. A couple of years later she had 3 broken ribs for three months before she was referred to an o  rthopod who did a ct scan and found the fractures.)     Anyway she won't get out of bed sometimes for a couple of days. She's on Tramadol for pain so she shouldn't be in a lot of pain should she?  Last weekend she lost control of her bowels. She can control her urine just not her bowels. Could that be a side effect of the Tramadol or might it be from the injury?    Being bed ridden is one thing but it seems to me she's just given up or wants attention. And I really hate changing diapers on my mother.     So between the staying in bed and the incontinence I'm thinking it's time to place her somewhere. But should I be looking at assisted living or a nursing home?    I apologize for the rambling on here - I just can't seem to write a short post.

Feeling frustrated.,Hi     My mother is in a very nice nursing home private room and private pay loving staff and she's very happy generally. I tend to not be a complainer and if something comes up with her care I focus on fixing it or getting someone to check it out in a relaxed nice manner.         Lately I've been wondering though if I'm being too nice and perhaps tolerating stuff that they should be more on top of. These haven't been major conditions conditions so I've just tended to handle them as they come up and move on. If I see something off physically I mention it to the nurse and they take action. Done. They haven't all happened at the same time either. It's just that the place is so so expensive that I get irritated sometimes but I take a deep breath and let it go or put it aside.         So for those who have LO in a NH  I'm trying to do a reality check. What do you expect from your facilities?  Do they have guidelines in place to check for fingernail fungus eyes and bruises?  I know they do a weekly skin check but am not sure what that encompasses exactly( I get the impression it has to do with checking the genital areas and also for pressure sores).       Here's some of the items-      *I noticed the puffy red eye last weekend though I didn't say anything then - honestly slipped my mind as mom wasn't complaining and we had a good first day outside for the year.  When I was back on Thursday I noticed the eye again and saw mom tear a little bit- it wasn't bothering her at all but I did mention it to the nurse who referred it to the supervisor.  She thought it was pink eye and said she'd contact the doctor to get drops for it. Drops have been ordered but the eye seems to be getting better now on its own.        *I also noticed three very odd discolored fingernails about 6 weeks ago mentioned it to the nurse and they had a doctor look at and nail cream was ordered for fungus.        *I also noticed a bruise and bump on the leg in the past that I brought to their attention. ( The nurse supervisor was upset that staff had not caught it).  I'm pretty sure this was caused by how she  was transferred out or into her bed ( there's a metal rod and the cap had fallen off. After mom had another skin tear in the same place I moved the cap from the other side of the bed and taped it on with masking tape so it wouldn't fall off and expose her leg to the unfinished metal rod. I didn't tell anyone I did this.       *I discovered that one of mom's pressure stockings was completely shreaded in the toe and it took me over a month to get it replaced( that's another story) but it just boggled my mind that her caregiver who puts them on each day couldn't just mention it to someone so it could be replaced.         * Have you seen caregivers wipe your LO after toileting without plastic gloves?  I was told they were supposed to do this.  After the pink eye issue I did mention to the 2nd shift supervisor that I didn't want to get anyone in trouble and didn't want to name names  but I had noticed  one of mom's  caregivers not using gloves( several times on different occasions) and maybe could they make a general reminder to everyone about that.  That's the first time I've EVER said anything about caregivers by the way.        * Painful transfers.  It seems about every 4-5 months mom has an episode of increased lower back pain and I've started thinking that it's actually more of a caregiver transfer issue then anything else.  When I saw mom on Thursday after not seeing her since Sunday she was in her room moaning with pain.  She told me her lower back and bottom really hurt.  She's been pain free for months and was perfect on Sunday.  When I asked how long it had been that way she paused and then began to say that the aides were throwing her around- translate- someone probably twisted her transferring to toilet or bed. ( I know they don't throw people). I took her down to the 2nd shift supervisor and had her repeat it and of course told supervisor I think someone twisted her the wrong way.        I then found out the next day that mom has a new caregiver( also new to the NH) and her old aide has been moved to a different side of the building- so I'm thinking this might have been the reason- the old caregiver handled mom beautifully.  Supervisor told me that she and the nurse manager met with new aide and explained how to transfer my mother( she is very anxious about transferring and has tight tight muscles) and can't be twisted.  I also have signs up in mom's room from the last time she had an issue as reminders for substitute caregivers to transfer her slowly. Would you do anything in addition to this? I'm nervous about this new caregiver and now mom is still having more pain but I can't tell if it's she's recovering from the initial injury and the caregiver is doing better or if she's continuing to not do it right.  UGH.              p.s. And finally- probably what's adding to my stress is that mom had one elevated liver enzyme in her last set of bloodwork and the doctor has ordered a 5 Nucleotybase to try figure out the cause.  She's also on the max dose of Tylenol- been like this for about 8 months and I've been meaning to talk to the doctor about doing a trial to get it reduced and then this arises. Ugh. But this is a different issue it just makes all the other petty stuff that much worse to take.  It also I found out took 10 days to get the sample for the follow up drawn when the results were faxed to the doctor- another irritation.

Yesterday I went with her and my father to her neurology appointment because she has been having some phantom smells and sounds. We wanted to see if there was anything to do for it. The doc decided against meds because my mother doesn't react well to meds and the med he wanted to us has pretty serious possible side effects such as heart attack or stroke. But anyway I asked him what stage she was in and he wouldn't really answer I'm guessing he didn't want to upset her but he did say she was very advanced. I didn't realize it was advanced. I thought it would be on the severe side of moderate but no she is in the advanced stages. She is losing weight because she can't or won't eat and she is now having these phantom smells/sounds. She has had hallucinations before but they seemed to be caused by some pain meds. I also think she has some phantom pain that may have a root in real back pain. But the meds and all other forms of help we have gotten for her have done nothing for the pain. That is why I wonder if it isn't phantom or nerve pain. But anyway I'm pretty down today.

I told him that I need to go with him to his appointments and he hit the ceiling. He left Saturday morning and has been down at another property 3 hrs away ever since. He called me Tuesday and said he has an appt Mon for his physical so he's coming back on Sunday after church. I was a basket case when he left because I am afraid of him driving. I was afraid he was going to get lost or get in an accident. He lost his phone Sunday and when he loses something he can't retrace his steps to remember where it might be.

I know dehydration can affect mental status so with her history I'm just a little surprised her dr isn't focused on that.( Mom has a long psych history but has been stable for 5 months)  But please give me your thoughts.         Mom's last results from early April were 31 ( the range is 0-23).  There was no direction from the doctor to push fluids yet February of last year when it was 30 her NP requested the NH staff to push liquids. I have a copy of the note. Why at 30 but not 31?  In December two weeks after being discharged from the worst psych hospitalization ever her BUN was 28.  She had to get fluids while on the psych floor and before coming to the psych floor.         Here's the BUN rundown:  April 2014 - 31  Jan 2014 - ? but needed IV fluids at ER for side pain investigation- dx- probably gas or kidney stone. Pain cleared w Maloxx cocktail  Dec 2013- 28  Oct 2013- 26  May- 2013- 69- UTI issues  Feb 2013- 30- Order to push fluids by Nurse Practioner- ( Is she a better medical professional than her doctor?)  Oct 2012- 28        By the way I held off following up w dr on this because she did order another follow up panel due to an elevated alkaline phosphotase. ( 5 nuclei tybase to check for why it was high.  It took awhile to get back but came back normal which means she doesn't have a liver issue.) Got some info yesterday from the NP but she didn't have time to talk long so didn't ask about BUN.        Today however I ran into the doctor while she was doing rounds at the nursing home.  We  chatted a bit and I asked her what she thought about the BUN.          ( Gasp- I called it the ""dehydration number"") She told me she knows that dehydration can affect the elderly and make them more confused (I think maybe she didn't remember the number as it was earlier this month) and I mentioned that I was concerned about it because of mom's recent episode.  She said she just tells the NH staff to push fluids but there was never an official note written and I know they have NOT been doing this. I do though I bring mom smoothies.   Anyways I just need to get more info from others about this number so I can get a little more certainty and decide what's next. Thank you for any comments!!!        p.s. Dr. does not think mom's episode is due to an infection and thinks Mom could be ""transitioning""( next stage of dementia) I think this might be true but still wondering about dehydration...",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505885,,,AlzConnected,,,

Lip balm to keep lips moist- hospice will likely supply lemon sponge things for the same purpose     Standard pillows and body pillows are great for placing your mom's arm on keeping her from tilting to one side of another or just providing a quasi safe cushioned area-they are great -for relieving pressure at pressure points for her comfort how to's on internet and hospice can show you also     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kSjHtHSJCw,False,jfkoc,2011-12-04,20453.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505727,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have taken the Savvy Caregiver Training and am in 2 support groups.  My real question is why does she keep having  these cycles where she ramps up again I get 10 phone calls a day each one worse than the last (mom does sundown some days worse than others)?     We see the geriatric neurologist every 3 months to monitor her medications and have her on a very low dose of Ativan and Lexapro. She has stopped the Namenda after three years (and spitting the pills out).  We monitor her for UTI's my physical therapist friend helps her with any headaches and orthopedic pain we have dealt with her dental issues. All the obvious things that may result in increased confusion anxiety and anger. She wants to go home as many people with AD do (even when they are home). I've tried distraction having her talk to her doctors (who she thinks will let her go home just because she asks) calling the priest friends psychologists…the list is endless.  She refuses to participate in any of the activities at the ALF; I have gotten her once or twice to listen to music or play a game if I am there with her. I do work full time and can't always adjust my schedule to match the activities at the ALF.     There seems to be no consistent pattern to her winding up it can happen when she's perfectly healthy or when she has a UTI.  It doesn't seem to matter if she's had a lot of company or just me for the week (I see her 5 times a week on average). I just hope for some kind of pattern or reason or way to predict or prevent these outbursts. There are so many losses with this disease we took her computer to the ""repair"" shop because she no longer could use it and swore it was broken-15 calls a day to my husband or I. I have her dog because she fell with him and almost killed him by overfeeding him and not letting him out enough. She feels these losses but no longer thinks she has AD or any problems; it is the world that is all wrong. I had to take scissors from her as well as sharp knives. She thinks people steal from her in the middle of the night they take her milk or cookies.     AH forgive my ranting but I am not sure I am getting any better at this.

Need help!,I don't even know where to begin.  I'm the caregiver for my mother who lives 85 miles from my home.  I stay with her almost all the time leaving my own home and husband for a week at a time sometimes more.  My youngest sister and her husband and their teenage daughter moved into my mother's home after losing their home five years ago.  Because my sister and her husband have to drive long distances to work and planning things outside the home on the weekends this is a huge problem.  I have another sister who is about 18 miles away but she also is a caregiver so isn't a lot of help although she does reluctantly spend a few hours with mother on the weekends.     Mother has no cartilage in her knees and has needed replacement surgery for many years which she absolutely refuses to have done and is in constant excrutiating pain.  Still she insists on spending most of her time up trying to do housework but mostly just prowling and making messes.  She's quite confused as to where she is and doesn't seem to have any memory of the time that has passed.  The problem is that when she asks questions we tell her the truth and she becomes upset.  She knows the answer and says that she gets tired of hearing that she's lived in the same home for 40 years.  She has a dog that is her baby but she thiniks her dog is sick and dying and sometimes sits and cries over her.  She feeds her about four times a day but still thinks her dog isn't eating enough and that her ribs are showing.  Her dog doesn't want to eat that much and a lot of food goes to waste.  I don't want to resort to lying to my mother but she really gets mad at me and sarcastically says I think I know everything.  She is accusing other family members of stealing valuable jewelry from her and swears that her favorite ring is not the one she bought.       Mother was always stubborn and nagged and complained a lot and she's never quiet.  She gets mad at me if she thinks the tv is too loud and she only wants it on one certain channel all the time but she never watches anything.  She complains that she never gets to go to the grocery store and we offer to take her every time anyone goes but she never feels like going anywhere.  It's terrible trying to get her ready to go to the doctor.  I buy her clothes but she refuses to wear anything I buy for her and she rarely eats anything healthy.  She only wants soda pop and sweets.  When we try to get her to eat something healthy she says she's not hungry.     I love my mother so much and it's breaking my heart to see this happening to her.  She's worked very hard all her life and she definitely deserves better care than what she's getting from me but we can't afford an assisted living home.  I just want to be able to be nicer in handling these difficult situations that arise.  I admit that at times I can be very short with her but I need help in dealing with all this madness in my life so that I can give her the loving care she deserves.,False,Minx,2014-04-26,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505762,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is very unconsolable and is talking of ending her life. She has herself all worked up fixated on calling 911 and getting out of there. She is in a good place with a very good person yet she is refusing to shower eating and drinking very little. I have put a call in to her Dr. no reponse yet.

Find out the visiting hours before you decide to go there.           Do they include meal times? If your LO has issues with eating or not taking meds and you aren't able to be there during meal times this may not be the best place to go.  Are visiting hours during the day at meals or later in the evening?  What time does your LO go to bed?  Are visiting hours at their normal bedtime?   They may have to stay up later till visiting hours are over.  Are you able to take off work if visiting hours are only during working hours?       Mom's unit was:  Mon Wed Friday 7:30-8:30pm.  Tues and Th  11:30-12:30.  Sat and Sun-  11:30-12:30 and 7:30-8:30pm.  These hours were unbearable to me as my mom refused to eat during the first part of her stay and I wasn't able to be there during meals. She also dehydrated on the unit and needed IV fluids. I had to make a request of the doctor to come in at dinner early if she hadn't eaten. They let me do this twice. They did hold her tray though and I was allowed to try to feed her at 7:30 when I came in.  ( I've been on a few different units in Ohio and checked in the Philly area and have not seen hours like this for geriatric patients except at this particular place but very important to check!)        2.  Is the unit truly geriatric meaning only elderly or do they take younger adults?   There is a difference between a geriatric  unit  and a geriatric  program.         Mom's unit  had a geri program and had both elderly and other adults though they tried to keep people I think over 60 I did see a few people in their 20's and 30's. If you are on a geriactric unit  I believe you'll tend to see more liberal visitation policies that include meal time.      3. What time can residents go to bed?           4. Are residents allowed to have visitors in their rooms?        5. If your LO is stabilizing on a medical floor before being admitted to a psychiatric floor and is seen by a psychiatrist find out if ""Is this the same psychiatrist that will treat your LO on the psych unit?""          This was never communicated to me so I assumed that the dr. that saw my mom in the ER was the same one that would see her on the psych unit.  But that wasn't the case. He held mom's psych meds and for part of the next day in Observation she was totally lucid and he was almost going to send her home but I asked if we could hold off another day to make sure she was stable( she had been psychotic for 2 1/2 weeks already in the nursing home). Her symptoms reappeared so I was relieved that I had asked him to give it another day.       6. Find out the hospital policy on how to request a different doctor or second opinion.   Don't just take a nurse's word for it. Reconfirm with social work or patient advocate first.      7 . How does communication work with the doctor?  What role does the social worker play? They are more involved on some units than others.  Do they have family meetings?  Do you mostly talk to the social worker? Do they return phone calls?       8. You are allowed to transfer out if you are dissatisfied if there is another hospital with a bed available.  I believe the attending doctors are the one's that can do this.           General Hospital Tips       1.  Review with a fine tooth comb the medication list the ER inputs and compare it against the one you brought.   Insist on a printed copy to do this. If you catch a mistake have them correct it asap.     * They inputted one of mom's seizure meds incorrectly dosing it only once a day instead of twice and every day instead of mon- grid.     * If a medication is reduced or stopped-  ASK WHY?   It could be they have valid medical reason for it related to the purpose of the medical admission.  Or it could be an error.       I'm not sure how I feel about this one:  Mom's routine tylenol for chronic pain was changed to prn only at a much reduced dose. I was told that was because it could mask a fever but they offered NO ALTERNATIVE for pain relief and I had to talk to the doctor to get it reinstated.  They also did not carry the Voltaren pain gel my mom had used in the nursing home and they only alternative they had- WHICH I HAD TO ASK ABOUT was Beng Gay.  I chose to not use that as I thought the smell would irritate my mother.       2.  After discharge- GET A COPY OF THE NEW MED LIST AND GO OVER WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB.",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147502015,,,AlzConnected,,,

Bloodwork was last checked in December and mom is seen once a month.        My mother has had some issues with dehydration and anemia in the past and I also have a little concern about monitoring her liver because she's on 3900 mg of Extra Strength tylenol( I think the max is 4000).  She takes Cozaar ( Losartan Potassium) for BP Synthroid for hypothyroidism lansoprazole from an ulcer a few years ago and some psych and seizure meds( those are under control). She also gets Voltaren gel 3-4 x a day for pain. This is an NSAID by the way but topical so absorption is much less likely to affect the stomach but I still worry about it.        Mom has had these fluctuating periods of drowsiness for the last few months and I've been wondering if there might be a medical basis like dehydration or anemia for it.          Another question- I've been wondering whether mom needs to still be on the lansoprazole and if should ask her nursing home doc or take her to a new GI doc for their opinion? ( Moved mom closer to me from out of state  1 1/2 years ago).  It's always a hassle having to go to see an outside specialist but thinking they might be the way to go.  Should I expect the primary doctor to have thought about this too?  I once had a NP tell me it was often good to just leave the elderly on these type of stomach antacid meds so wondered if the nursing home doctor felt the same way.      Any input would be appreciated.   Thanks!,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505043,,,AlzConnected,,,

( She only takes them at night now but after yesterday I feel we cannot handle her w/o additional help.)   I went on to say that there are increasing lapses in judgement difficulty with time perception and significant memory loss.  I further asked if she could administer a cognitive test w/o upsetting mom. I explained  that returning to neurologist may not be an option as mom does not wish to go and he was so terribly negative about her condition  stating that unless she takes his prescribed drugs she will not be able to take care of herself in a few years.  She did not do well with Aricept or Exelon.              I was afraid to mention bathing and hair washing problems as I am afraid she will think I am a horrible caregiver and perhaps call social services?    Does she have ground for calling social services as I cannot make mother bathe other than  with a sponge?   Mom mentioned to this nurse that she does not bathe regularly and the woman became quite outraged told her she needed to bathe twice a week.  Like that was possible!!,False,Vita99,2012-09-04,469.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505471,,,AlzConnected,,,

He reportedly did not hit his head.        He has been very very sleepy stopped coming down for meals and meds (always the things that he was obsessive about) and inability to self feed much due to increasing tremors and motivation/cognition.  His CNA's tell me that he will eat if he is fed.  Double incontinence arrived this week also a marked change. He was very fixated on bowel and bladder and reliably used the toilet and urinal.   Although he would have occasional accidents he would always realize when it happened and ask for help.  Now he just goes and sits in it although when asked if he went poop he will answer ""yes"".     I've asked for a urinalysis to examine to for a UTI.  I know that portable x-rays do not always reveal fractures but do not want to send him to the hospital for full diagnostics.  He is not reporting pain and when asked he says his back feels better.  He is tolerating being placed into sidely and back on his back without discomfort.  He's never been good at reporting pain even when I'm sure it existed so it was significant when he said he was hurting last week.  I am hoping his report of feeling better is accurate.     We were counseled about pallative care and have agreed that we want to avoid aggressive medical interventions and further hospitalizations.  I've been asked about stopping Exelon and Namenda but have postponed that decision until I get urinalysis results.     At this point Dad still knows who we are will remember basic facts like asking my daughter ""how's dance""?.  As little as this is it's something and I must research answers on the boards about when people have stopped Exelon and Namenda. It's my understanding that using it or stopping it will not effect overall life expectancy but just to prolong time at earlier stages.     So in addition to the basic urinalysis is there anything else anyone might suggest be looked at?   Repeat in house x-rays to rule out fractures?  What would be done for a vertebral fracture anyway?    Basically I just want to make sure Dad is as comfortable as possible and that we address anything within the guidelines of pallative care.  Your personal story  about the decision to stop/not stop Exelon/Namenda would also be helpful I'll also search the boards.",False,King Boo,2012-01-09,3593.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147505218,,,AlzConnected,,,

She had some others she didn't mention until Friday as well.   We reset a dental apt for later due to over scheduling prior to the sores.  She's been on a refuse to bathe stint for awhile sometimes days sometimes weeks.  She'd been itching these bumps then fiddling in her mouth..  Friday she had pain in her mouth suddenly and I looked an found abscesses.   She acted like I was conspiring against her because I set a dental appointment to check for infection which is tomorrow.     So she decided to shower tonight and at least 2 times I know of she was spraying these sores with gold bond earlier today.  Mom showered and after she let out this scream and I was frantic thinking she fell..  Reality dad was helping her put lotion on and he lifted a skin fold and unknowingly it was raw and sticking together so it separated when he lifted it..  She degraded him &amp; acted like he ment to do it and I felt horrible for him..  He left the room almost ready to cry with hands up as she slammed the door..

For most of the time I live life pretty normally but I've been so upset lately because this feel as if its going to never end and I will never move on. Its like she is a a walking vegetable for the most part. I hope I don't sound too morbid because I would never wish death upon my beautiful mom but I don't know how much longer I can stand to see her this way. Does this make sense? When someone passes you know they are at peace and you grieve normally and with the passing of time it gets easier. Will I ever grieve normally? I'm grieving somebody right in front of me and time won't heal it because she will still be here in this heart-breaking condition.

I took a too early retirement from a high 6 figure job to help my Dad take care of her.  I did this 11 months ago.  My dad turns 89 this week.  His mind is still pretty good but he was breaking down due to the mental and physical toll of taking care of Mom.  I was taking off and driving the 3.5 hours to drag her to the doctors (somehow my older sister who was living rent free in their old home 2 miles away couldn't get her to go or do much else for them ... She just complained if she had to make more than one trip to the store a week because Dad couldn't remember everything along with his now for the first time having to also be the typical homemaker and bill payer things my Mom had always done).  Anyway I quit my job and for the first 6 months it was nonstop cooking and washing dishes helping Mom to the bathroom bill paying grocery shopping getting them both to the doctors.  Dad had let his enlarged prostrate go on so long that the only option was a suprapubic catheter.  His left knee should have been replaced years ago but at his age they only gave him a brace.  He has two untreated hernias from lifting Mom.  He still gets out and walks a lot but went through a real rough patch after the catheter surgery.  In the meantime my Mom had been diagnosed with dysphagia.  Her MMSE score was about 16. She was also having constant indigestion and ear pain swollen lymph nodes in throat.  They found a benign mass on her tongue base that's not a candidate for removal.   Her endoscopy results were normal.    During all of this I left for a few hours each day to attend some local classes.  That stopped when Mom ended up with a bowel obstruction and in the hospital.  We had already started pureeing her food based upon the swallow study but after the trauma of the nG tube in the ER and coming out of adverse reaction to drugs they gave her (she slept for three days) she couldn't swallow at all.  After much tears and overruling the one sister that lived near here.  I had the feeding tube inserted in her abdomen.  I spent every night with her in the hospital and in rehab.  My oldest sister who's husband had just retired (she didn't work) to stay a couple of days with my Dad but then she went back out of state so that she could send me texts everyday about how many Miles she had walked with her new friends in her retirement dream home.  Anyway I finally got Mom home and after much work arranging home care speech therapy she is back to eating pureed food but swallowing pills and thin liquids are a real problem.  I give her meds juice and water through the tube.   She doesn't want to walk but we push her to walk back from the bathroom with a walker and lots of assistance.  I have occupational therapy still coming in.  Physical therapy quit on her because she just cried.  She feeds herself and she talks.. When prompted.  She laughs at the tv and is adamant on letting you know if she is happy with what is on tv.  It's a challenge to keep it on something she likes so we have fell in love with the new DVR I  bought.  She spends most days in her upright chair in the living room.  I had Dad put in a bird feeder outside the window near the dining room table.  She loves the birds and squirrels  I'm venting but we do have fun.  Some of the family and one of the great grandkids came for her birthday.  My local sister couldn't make it and I get upset when I think of her coming in to the rehab center and acting with the nurse like she being the scientifically educated one would be feeding my Mom through the tube with me.  No one has since the day Mom and I left rehab on October 12th.  No one has used Mom's feeding tube but me.  I don't regret the decision.  There wasn't another choice to me.  She is still here.  She's not a vegetable.  Since coming home from the hospital she still hasn't gotten back to where she could get herself out of bed or in and out of the wheelchair to the toilet.  She can't or won't wipe herself but she still isn't nowhere near what I assume is the average person on a feeding tube.    I now have help with everything else.  Should I teach my 89 year old father?  His hands are getting more and more shaky.  The help that I now have from the state are great.  She gets 34.5 hours a week but they aren't allowed to use the PEG tube.  So can I never leave the house for more than a few hours.??   Anyone else have that issue?,False,TexasShirl,2014-03-02,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147504412,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'd love to hear from others about their LO and if they have regular exercise therapy or are just completely sedentary. I want to do the right thing for my mom.  I'm concerned the therapy may be contributing to some recent pain complaints but I'm also worried for her to not have it. I worry that if she stops she'll become very tight which could cause more pain( see below) and that getting weaker may also cause pain. I also believe that physical activity may help slow the progression of dementia a bit and if we stop..will her dementia advance quicker?  Mom is also sensitive to some pain meds and there aren't that many options for her so that becomes a complicating factor.       She used to be SO  motivated to get support to help her walk with her walker and she loved the comraderie of the therapy staff.  And she also loved the restorative therapy walks she'd get once a day after the physical therapy would end. She has some osteoarthritis ( had two hip fractures) and some occasional muscle pain along with a very mild case of Cerebral Palsy. I used to think that therapy helped keep her from getting too tight and gave her chances to get up out of her wheelchair and move a bit. I did notice that sometimes she might get a little achy after the restorative therapy walks but it didn't last.        Now though the situation seems different.  Not only is there a new therapy staff in her NH ( not as good IMO) but she's also weaker and hasn't gained back her confidence in walking which she lost after a geri psych hospitalizaiton 2 months ago. Mentally she's stable again though a little more confused than prior to the hospitalization but she complains of being scared and sometimes has pain when they try to walk her. She had a short period of this kind of anxiety with PT several months ago w the old staff but she got through it.        Mom has also started complaining of pain in her hips  occasionally when I see her and today also in her shoulder blades and upper arms. ( She also had therapy today) Coincidence? But these occasional pain complaints seem to have started right around the same time that the therapy restarted this year. She goes twice a week. Other than that she is very sendentary and spends most of her walking hours in her wheelchair.      She gets Tylenol 1300 mg 3 a day wears a Lidocain patch on her back and gets Voltaren pain gel as a PRN.  She seems to be having pain when I see her at3 or 4pm and I've had to get the nurse to put some cream on her.  A month ago she had absolutely no issues at all. She also wasn't in physical therapy.        Trying to weigh this all whether it's just dumb to keep trying with therapy or not but also want to understand the risks.  What are the benefits you all have seen for your loved ones with therapy?       As always these things are never clear cut. For instance I mentioned to the head PT today that could they please if Mom is complaining of pain first take her to the nurse to get pain cream and maybe try to reapproach later?       Any input would be appreciated.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147503747,,,AlzConnected,,,

He is 80 years old with Lewy Body Dementia. He seemed to make progress for a few days following surgery both in the hospital and when he returned to the nursing home. On Friday he was still eating but he was also very tired and slept most of the day. On Saturday he ate breakfast. But when we were with him during lunch he simply sat in his chair staring up toward a window never looking at either my Mom or myself. He ate about 10 small bites of food and then refused anything else. He did not eat dinner Saturday night and has eaten nothing since -- he has gone without any food at all for four days and without any fluids at all for two days. He fell into a deep sleep on Monday and has not spoken or opened his eyes. The nurses have had to suction his mouth and his lungs feel like they're rattling when we touch his chest. I'm sure he must have pneumonia at this point though his blood pressure remains normal. His oxygen content is down to 90% even with oxygen being administered.     We know Dad will not wake up. Hospice is making him comfortable. He received morphine last night on a regular schedule but had none today. He doesn't seem to be in pain at all.      To those of you who've gone through this -- how long might Dad last? How long did your loved one last? I've heard of everything from a day or two to several weeks. The hospice nurse actually didn't believe he was going to make it through last night based on his raspy breathing etc. I certainly would like to hear from others as to what we might expect.,False,virtualhorizon,2013-05-03,134.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147503776,,,AlzConnected,,,

He was released today and is at home under the hospice care. The past days have been a whirlwind of decision anxiety loss of sleep and all that goes with this sort of thing.   .  My husband and his brothers along with other friends and family  have been at the hospital at varying times with  my mother-in-law. She has been surrounded by support. She is a train wreck right now.

Also in all the time I've lived with her I've been able to get her to take Ibuprofen for her arthritis pain maybe 3-4 times.  She just will not take medication period.  Stubborn as an ox.       I've been her POA since 2009 but I haven't even been allowed near the check book until about 6 months ago that's how independent she has been.  She worked at Gulf Laboratories from 1947 to 1978 and had a ""powerful"" job for a woman from that time period.  She definitely met the glass ceiling.  She has always loved her paperwork so it's still a very odd feeling for me when I handle these things now.       Anyway last night I found a reddit thread about caregivers dealing with dementia and it hit me that a lot of these stories sound very familiar.  I always just thought granny was getting old and slowing down which of course is still true but yeah I'm pretty sure she has dementia of some sort.  The one test I did she scored 78/80.  And some of the stories really scare me.  The things I may yet have to go through.  And suddenly I realized I could use some advice so here I am.  I think I will lurk awhile and read first though.       We are still at the stage where she can be really hilariously funny.  A couple weeks ago she said she wanted a roast.  So I bought her one it was like $25.  She wouldn't eat it said it was too tough.  So ok I figured I'd buy her a filet mignon.  Doesn't get more tender than that.  So I roasted three of them up with onions and carrots for like 4 hours they practically melted in your mouth.       She asked me what was I eating a pork chop?  I said no filet mignon.  She said ""Flaming Dog!?""  lol!  No grandma not flaming dog.   (she's also pretty much deaf at this point which at times is a blessing and other times a curse.  And other times just funny.)",False,GmaTessiesCaregiver,2014-02-08,31.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147503850,,,AlzConnected,,,

She spent two nights in the hospital followed by two weeks in skilled nursing rehab.

From what I've read about shingles this seemed to be a fairly mild case. She never needed anything stronger than Tylenol for the pain and most of the symptoms cleared up within a few weeks.     Last night I was watching TV with her and one of those commercials about shingles (""If you've had chicken pox the shingles virus is already inside you"") came on. When it mentioned that shingles is a neurological disease I had a ""head smack"" moment.     Could some of her cognitive decline since the hospitalization be due to the shingles? She seemed to be doing better in the SNF and then got worse after she came home right about the time the shingles symptoms started. Does anyone have experience with this?     Edited to add: And I guess what I'm really asking is if the shingles precipitated the decline whether it's possible that she'll get any of her lost function back as she heals? Or is it gone for good once it's gone?",False,DotsDaughter,2014-01-16,868.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147503771,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was offended and changed doctors.  I found out about that diagnosis this past December during an urgent visit.     The doctor she had from 2006 to 2013 in my opinion was incompetent.  I finally terminated her care with this doctor after a series of issues including my mother have melanoma and being prescribed antibiotics for months. Her insurance requires referrals to specialists and the doctor said it was not cancer. I had to threaten legal intervention before she got the referral. Mom had a biopsy and had to have an emergency MOS procedure removing a 1.5 x 3 inch section of her cheek and part of her salivary glade. 4 weeks after the procedure she fell and sustained a spiral hip fracture on the same hip she had replaced 23 months prior. Mom still wanted to keep her but 5 weeks after surgery she insisted on having her annual physical. During the exam the doctor performed a PAP smear. When my cried out in pain I barged into the room and the doctor was forcing my mother's leg outwards and complaining my mom wasn't cooperating.  Mom was 85 at the time dad had been dead for 12 years and she hasn't been sexually active since he had prostrate surgery for cancer. This test had been done every year and she never had an abnormal test. That was the last straw.     I had demanded that she be given some testing for Alheimers. I have the DPOA.  The doctor said she's just getting older and forgetful. Bullcrap. Administer the test or I'm filing malpractice. Of 30 questions mom participated in 10 and got 2 right.  She then refused to answer anymore. The doctor said they could put her on meds but if she refused to cooperate there was nothing she could do and could not provide a qualified diagnosis.      My mother has OCD and a mental condition called Historonic Personality Disorder.  She obsesses about everything. Refuses to take any type of medication because of the warning labels there is nothing wrong with her ever and everyone is out to get her because she's a foreigner/old/English is her second language. She plays the victim and will not listen to anyone other than my dad.  It's been he'll since he died.     I've been trying to get two medical certifications that she is no longer capable of taking care of herself.  BofA would not accept the POA that we executed years ago so I has to take her to the bank and get it done. She argued with me and the bank official for 2 hours that her ""brain was fine"" and she didn't want me stealing her money. I has to point out three checks we had to put stop payments on because they were sent to the wrong companies for large amounts. The bank official finally agreed to complete the paperwork after I threatened to report them and withdraw all her money a sizable sum after a 40 year relationship.  The bank official asked my mom some very pointed questions having to do with the accounts and her incoming deposits and mom couldn't answer one.  Kept referring her to me.     So now I'm at the point where I'm completely frustrated.  My mother is combative and physically violent. I lost my job due to the amount of time I was taking off. Because of the financial losses I incurred in taking care of her and supporting her I had no choice but to move the 450 miles to her home.  I sleep on a couch and she doesn't want any of my things here. Everything except clothes and necessities to make life endurable is in storage.  I technically live out of the garage even having to keep my food there. Last night she told me to get out.  She can't take it anymore.  Sh 10:30 at night after hours of sundowning she starts screaming at me for no reason.  I was going through mail making no noise that she could hear. I have nowhere to go because I'm broke.  She doesn't care because I'm taking over everything and making her life miserable.     Mom has always been self centered and selfish. Since I was a child it had to be her way. I obeyed or there would be consequences.  She is after me all the time even if I take too long in the bathroom by her standards.  I had to make the choice last year to divorce my husband of 20 years and she's ashamed of that. I embarrassed her. Because of the stress of the last few years I started smoking again. She's embarrassed by that and has ordered me to stop. Only whores smoke.  And she's en brasses by my weight even though I've reached my halfway goal and have dropped 60 pounds. I'm a type 2 diabetic with hyper tension and fibromyalgia. I have to take meds for that and she wants me to stop taking them. I take too much and it will kill me. Mom should know.  She was a nurse. In the 50's.      I have to put her in assisted living but I'm road blocked by her HMO. If she won't go I can't force her. She accuses me of stealing from her tells anyone who will listen that I'm mentally ill. She's alienated her neighbors she has no friends and refuses to participate in any activities in her retirement community.  For all intents and purposes she's a hermit and it's everyone else's fault.     What can I do? It seems the only choice is to call the police and have her taken in on a 72 hour psych hold.  She's not eating regularly and is getting worse as each day goes by. I'm trying to find work but am seriously concerned that she will continue the behavior she demonstrated while in my last job which was to call me over a dozen times a day and ask why I can't be with her.  There's too much going on and she's being harassed by calls and mail. One call from a telemarketer sends her over the edge.     Please - does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this so I'm not riddled with guilt over being ""mean"" or ""not loving"" her?",False,solslett,2014-02-18,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147504113,,,AlzConnected,,,

(I didn't need to slip and fall on the icy ground surrounding me this Christmas Eve).   Yeah... going on it's twelfth hour the fire had burned-down requiring the addition of yet  another heavy Mesquite Log.      The previous day's warning of the impending First Ever Christmas Reunion (Can a  ""First Ever"" actually even be a ""Reunion"" ?) initially came as a shock.  I could imagine hoards of unknown strangers &amp; family members inundating my thoughts and monopolizing my precious time.  I'd become accustomed to my solitude and the thought of having to ""Behave"" around civilized people again I viewed as an intrusion in my life Christmas or no Christmas !  Bah...

Even I get lucky once in awhile.  ""In Awhile"" being keywords !        Well I already had sufficient wood chopped-up and the bird was here.  All that would be  required of me was to babysit the fire overnight so the fire didn't go out and the bird got cooked.   After that I'd just have to stay awake long enough for everyone to leave after the feast was over.      Anyway... here I sit at three o'clock in the friggin' morning freezing my butt off  killing-off my Christmas present just for survival in the cold and not enjoyment.  On top of that  I can't even see the Reindeer much less the naked dancing girls because of this damned  fog !  At least the Reindeer are probably relieving themselves out on my lawn and in my attempts to find something positive in all this that was the best I could do.   The lawn would be fertilized !      Seven O'clock and a final check of the bird...

Success !      I grab my gloves in order to lift-out my prize and take it inside; but what do I find.  It's so light !  Due to some unfathomable action the turkey meat has disappeared leaving only this eye-pleasing husk of skin that would proudly have graced the front page of any  epicurean magazine if only for the vision.      An incandescent stream of vitriolic phrases issues-forth from my mouth as I quickly search for a remedy to my now desperate situation.  Five hours left on Christmas Day  with all the stores closed and a hungry hoard resolutely on its way to eat me out of house and home.  What do I do... what DO I do ???      I look to the sky and ask God what else he has planned for me this day.   Does He have any ideas; and what do I see... Ducks !  Headed towards the fire-reservoir at the end of my property.  Thank You Lord !      I unlock my tool shed and grab my old Browning Auto-5 and a handful of shells.   Look Out Duckies...

My mom just recently in a nursing home no job no money and so on. But I made it through all right. I will have to see my doctor (when I can afford it) to see if I can get help.     Mom is doing fine in the nursing home. She doesn't really know she's in a nursing home. The staff loves her so much. Mom gets along well with the other folks that live there too. I go in there around 2 maybe 3 times a week and stay and visit for a while. When I'm ready to leave a staff member distracts her while I go out the door. That's one of the hardest things for me still and probably always will be. The only peace of mind I get is knowing that in there she is safe. Out here with me she wasn't. It was just a matter of time before something horrible happened and I could feel it coming. It was going to happen. Yes I could have kept a better eye on her but I couldn't do it alone and that's what I would have had to of done. Nobody was going to step up and help me.     I start school Monday. I will only be taking one class as I cannot afford any more than that. I will be trying to find work too. I don't take pleasure in my situation at all. I still feel guilt and I have no idea why because the rational side of me knows I couldn't do anything different.

I have denial that is very deep but I'm able to recognize it.     I placed my mom in the nursing home mostly because I wasn't able to keep her safe anymore because I don't have enough eyes and hands. Also I wasn't giving her the amount of physical care she needed either. At the nursing home she gets three square meals a day at the same time she goes to bed at the same time she gets her pills on time every day her dentures are cleaned every day her bathroom habits are monitored very closely she gets a shower when needed she is monitored by her favorite doctor and my favorite doctor as well. I wasn't doing all these things. The fact that I couldn't take care of her properly anymore is painful as well.

I decided against radiation treatments because he was very confused after anesthesia (even weeks after) weak fragile and could barely walk to the bathroom unassisted. That was months ago. Now he has a lesion on his nose that the surgeon is concerned about. They want to operate again next month. I feel some guilt over deciding against radiation since the cancer may be back or it could just be scar tissue causing him not to be able to breathe from that side of his nose. They told me to consult with a radiologist and I didn't even do that.     I want to know if anyone else's loved one had cancer &amp; Alzheimer's (I think my dad is in the sixth stage of Alzheimer's) and had to have radiation treatments. I've heard mostly scary things about radiation &amp; chemo. His Alzheimer's has progressed now as well. I just cannot see him going through more pain I want him to be comfortable and have the best quality of life possible. If the cancer is back they will recommend radiation again I don't know if it's more harm than good anymore.     These decisions are tearing me apart.

My grandpa 77 years old has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. I have been by his side since the very beginning of the diseases.     While he was living at home still I helped him around the house made the house more accessible for him picked him up when he fell dealt with angry outbursts and etc.     He was rushed to the hospital September 6th and from the hospital he was admitted into a nursing home. My papa has been declining rapidly ever since.     Last week he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and the antibiotics failed to work because his throat muscles are not working anymore. He cannot eat or drink anything by mouth anymore. My papa has an IV for nutrients and his medicine is squirted under his tongue. He is on morphine for pain and ativan for anxiety.     He is now on comfort care.     This is by far the worst thing my family and I have ever been through. Looking for support and what to expect while nearing the end stages.     Anyone else have or had a loved one with aspiration pneumonia?     Sending my best wishes to everyones loved ones,False,nik1255,2013-12-26,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147502694,,,AlzConnected,,,

Well could be Tuesday depending on when things get organized. I'm having a horrible time dealing with this. Night time is obviously the worst because I have nothing to do but lay awake and think. Day time is better because that's when mom is at her worst.     I'm terrified that I'm going to fall apart. I'm not sure what's holding me together now. Well not much because a few nights I have cried until I've fallen asleep. I feel like a sneaky underhanded deceitful little brat. I'm doing this behind mom's back. She has no idea and that is killing me too. Everything is bothering me. I wish I could explain. I know I have no choice but that doesn't make it any easier.     At least with physical pain you can take pills to make it go away. What do you do about emotional pain? I'm already on anti depressants. I can't take stuff to help me sleep because I need to be alert. I was having a beer now and then and realized I was needing it instead of just wanting it. I also caught myself sipping one in the early morning hours. That scared me and made me realize I might be headed for a problem. I'm nowhere near being an alcoholic but drinking in the morning; not a good sign.     I have to try very hard to keep my thoughts where they are supposed to be. I have to constantly think of the reasons why I'm placing mom. Her wandering being the most obvious reason for me. Then with Christmas coming; things are made even worse. Mom probably won't be home for Christmas because there will have to be an adjustment period for her.     Sometimes I wish I could just hide under a bed or stick myself in a bubble so I don't have any worries or concerns anymore. So I wouldn't have to suffer emotional pain anymore.

However part of me thinks that she was thinking about it. I think she's confused and really doesn't understand where she is. Which makes me even sadder. I didn't stay more than a few minutes because I sensed she was getting restless or confused by my presence. After about 5 minutes or so I told her that I needed to run some errands and that I would be back. I got up from the table and told her I would see her later.     I managed to get out of the nursing home and into my truck before I burst into tears again. At least I didn't cry in front of mom.

My house is on a lot with a separate driveway but the caregivers always park in my driveway because Mom's house is actually on the farm which is gated. It can be a pain in the butt to get out unhook gate drive through and get out again to re-hook.  Caregivers have never used it and instead cut through from my house.  I can not see the front of Mom's house just the rear. In the last two weeks I have seen things that make me suspect someone is coming in through the farm drive. One morning still dark I was making coffee and could see a car leaving the farm drive. I knew it was strange but maybe my granddaughters came early in their mom's car to feed their horses. Other than that everyone that comes here that works on the farm have pickup trucks including the granddaughters. I texted them and asked if they were here before school and they said no. So chalked it up to someone turning around.  5 days later when I went out early to feed my horses the gate was unlatched and wide open.  Big red flag because we all make sure it is latched at night because we would never want any horses to get out on the road.  It happened again this weekend.  I have lived here for almost 20 yrs and this is not something that has happened but a handful of times in all 20 yrs.  Also a mountain bike showed up sitting next to mom's house and when I asked my daytime caregiver (sister of night time) about it she called her sister and had a private conversation.  Sister said the her boyfriend brought it last weekend for her to ride. I was surprised that she had a boyfriend (newly divorce) as she said she was done with men for a long time. When I asked the sister when she had time for a boyfriend she said she really didn't have time and didn't see him hardly at all. She works a day job too.  The bike was gone today and another lady that works on my farm said that it was gone a few days ago.    If everything is so innocent why would she not tell me and why would they take the farm drive even though no one else does. My other neighbor said that she thought she heard voices on the farm at 5am this morning.  So I guess I need to play detective!  This makes me upset because this caregiver has had two abusive husbands so may attract men like that. Not to mention she is working......  Mom has made remarks about people ""working"" outside her window and voices. I pretty much didn't pay much attention except in the back of my mind now things seem too coincidental.  I can't really trust what mom says.  I am not going to ask her as I don't want it to be denied. I really need to find out for sure so guess I will be staying up late nights to keep a watch.  My dogs bark too around 9 or 10.

Yet when I took her up on that offer that was what I got from her which was ""no way!""     The other aunt becuz I had to put her name on the court papers was angry at me for months and said ""don't get me involved if I get the papers in the mail I will tear them up and throw them in the garbage"" she said ""I can't help you this is your life and you better just accept it are you feeling sorry for yourself.""  My Mom and I got up and left right there and we haven't gone back yet she calls for me to take her to 5 stores with my Mom who now has sciatica and is in rehab for that.  I had told her my Mom has progressed and gets tired etc and can't do the 5 stores in one day thing anymore she said ""just put her in the car and bring her over.""     The estate guardian is aware of this stuff going on and he says legally I do not have to constantly update the aunts or update them at all and if I do it is just as a courtesy.  I wanted my Mom to have support but I knew and still know I am her only support system and I will never let her down and will always be there for her.       My main goal when I had petitioned for the guardianship was to enroll her in a daycare program so she can have friends and do activities and have pride and feel useful and important and feel like a person instead of her selfish mean spirited sisters; however because she had been sleeping alot and now the sciatica about a month ago I have been looking at long term care facilities but am not sure I want to do it now.  I want her to be able to enjoy something before she has to do that.     She has no medicaid yet as NH is the worst for services.  But now that she is in a Mass rehab she is considered a Mass resident and I am going to put in for the Mass medicaid and take it from there.  My main concern is with her sleeping alot I felt she was too tired for daycare program but it might be stimulation for her and keep her awake more.  I have not been able to work becuz she can't be left alone so I have been on a caregiver agreement which isn't a whole lot but it is something.     So I have been going back and forth with adult day care program or long term placement.  She can eat herself dress herself with eating she at times need to be prompted or cued as to what is what on the plate she can wash herself after soap and water and towels are set up at sink she can floss and brush her teeth.  She has to be cued to drink throughout the day as she forgets but she loves hot tea and hot coffee no problem being cued for those.  She is able to walk but they have her using a walker as precaution becuz of sciatica.  I notice she has a bent leg when she walks cuz the pain travels down the leg but it straightens out when she lies down or sits.     The situation is so hard with no family support and all the chaos.  I do want to earn a living but I do want to spend as much time with her as I can.  If I can do nursing home alternative then why not start with that and if it doesn't work out then do long term care.       Just wanted some opinions and thanks if you have read this far.",False,Daughter only,2013-11-26,10.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501996,,,AlzConnected,,,

Having been down this road once before with my dad I know it is important to plan ahead before an emergency leads you to make less-than-ideal choices. My mom has had a very bad reaction to an invasive medical procedure (no anesthesia or medications but a lower GI barium study that was cold stressful upsetting etc.) that actually triggered what I believe was a ""delirium"" episode for about 12 hours post-procedure. That was over a year ago when she was still in the diagnostic stage of AD. Since then I've managed to talk her out of a routine colonoscopy and I think her GI doctor has actually sort of dropped off the map as far as recommending the routine colonoscopies she's had for years as the GI doctor is aware of what happened and her diagnosis. Anyway I know that the colonoscopy thing could resurface at any time and of course other issues can creep up. Mom also has routine (once or twice a year) dermatology appointments now that are essentially cancer-screening but have also routinely involved extensive burning/freezing/cutting of various skin tags and growths. So far these don't seem to have caused a big problem for her but I do feel nervous that they might at some point. She will be moving to my state in the next 6-12 months and I will need to get her set up with a whole new army of doctors for routine care and I am wondering what care we should seek at what stage . . . I don't want to neglect an aspect of her care that could keep her comfortable and healthy but I don't want to add stress and pain to her last months and years either and nor do I wish to extend her life past Stage 6 if at all possible as Mom had no desire to continue to live in the last stages of this disease and I intend to honor her wishes. Mom has her Living Will/Advanced Directive/etc in place but those directives are more directed at late stage (so in my mind more like Stage 6 and 7). But what about earlier in the disease?

They also gave her Tylenol with Codeine for when pain is bad honestly all I felt it did was make her tired and didn't help with the pain or walking although it did make her rest and not try to move around too much because she was tired from it.         I Recently put a deposit on an Assisted Living facility and they are expected to have a room available soon and my Mom is next on the list.  I have separate general questions related to that and I think I'll post a new topic for but regarding the pain and difficulty walking I'm now concerned that may throw some new complications to an already emotionally physically and mentally challenging huge change and move for both of us. If nothing else it's going to make the move more difficult and if she is in pain it could taint the whole experience - being in pain plus being in a new environment.  I now wish I made the move to ALF sooner but I didn't and I hate to delay it anymore and pass this available room up.  Any suggestions?,False,linsam,2013-03-19,67.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147502066,,,AlzConnected,,,

Over the past six months Mother’s weight and cognition had started to decline but overall she remained pretty healthy.  We were giving her nutritional supplements and anything else she would eat including lots of chocolate.  I live 100 miles away and she wanted constant attention so we hired a companion to help her 3 afternoons a week.  They would go shopping to the hair dresser and out to lunch at least once a week.  I would see Mother usually several days every other week and talk with her on the phone at least once a day.  My brother would see her at least twice a week and talk to her every day.     She would go to exercise every morning and sit next to Daddy.  They would let him come out of MC to do exercise with the ALF group.  After exercise she would usually go back and spend time with Daddy in the MC unit.  Some days he knew her name and that she was his wife some days he knew she was a nice woman and some days he flat out did not like her.  She went with the flow most days but some days her dementia would take over and she could not understand why he did not know his wife of 62 years!  That is what we called the wonderful world of two parents with dementia.  About the first of November she started having signs of a UTI and facial pain.  My brother took her to the ER they prescribed Neurontin (sp) and did a UA.  Cognitively she got worse and we did not hear from UA.  Took her to ER one week later severely confused smelly urine.  Prescribed an antibiotic for UTI and sent her home to ALF.  (These visits always on Friday night!)  The next night I was with her and she had a 7 minute seizure totally disoriented when she came to.  Stopped the Neurontin. That following week she physically and cognitively declined.  The following Saturday afternoon I got a call from the ER that she was on the wrong medication and needed IV meds to bring her to the ER immediately.  Off we go to the ER third time in three weeks for IV antibiotics.  She was so dehydrated they had to find a vein by ultrasound to give the IV.  Decided that an injectable antibiotic would work for remainder of treatments and sent her back to ALF with home health orders.  We immediately called Hospice.  Mom was barely eating.  She could still get into her wheel chair and “walk” with her feet.  We would take Daddy to see her every day.  He would ask her if she was feeling better and tell her he loved her.  After only a week on Hospice she was moved to the Hospice House for care.  We took Daddy to her ALF room to see her right before she was moved. He sat there and held her hand and asked her if she was feeling any better told her again he loved her and then said I hope you get better soon.  When she got to the Hospice House she (and we) was treated like a queen!  She had a few periods of consciousness but was mostly unconscious from the time we got there.  She was so sick and ready to die but would not let go.  We debated about taking Daddy to see her and decided against it.  I went to the MC and we called her and put him on speaker phone.  He told her all of the same things over the phone.  She lingered on.  The next day we had him call again.  They told us that he had tried to escape twice that day (for the first time ever) saying she is at home and needs me.  He got up in the middle of the night and paced the halls trying to get to her room.  The next morning my brother got Daddy and brought him to the Hospice House.  He sat down beside Mother and held her hand and rubbed her arm.  He looked at us and said what do I say and we told him.  He kissed her and then he felt of her heart.  He sat back down and held her hand some more.  He was tired we asked if he wanted to stay and he said yes and when we asked if he wanted to go back he said yes.  My brother took him back after he kissed her one last time and told her to get better.  On the way back he told my bother she would not be here long.  All of her systems started shutting down after Daddy came and she passed away peacefully the following morning two days before Thanksgiving.  We had to decide what to do about Daddy and the funeral.  We just did not think that he could would or should sit through her funeral.  We decided to do a private family viewing the day before the funeral and the wake.  I went to pick Daddy up and told him we were going to ------ (Mother’s name) funeral.  I thought ok we will go view the body and take him back to the MC and he will hopefully be fine. Fiblets can get us in trouble.  We walked in he looked at her showed no emotion and walked over and sat in a chair.  We were busy placing pictures and her “gold holiday tree” on tables.  My sister-in-law walked up to him and asked if he was ok and he asked when the service was going to start!  Scramble scramble scramble.  We all sat down my SIL said some of the eulogy she had prepared for the next day my niece sang the first verse of “Down to the River” which she was singing the next day and then SIL said a prayer.  SIL asked Daddy if he wanted to say anything and you could see him thinking I went over and knelt beside him and asked again if he want to say anything and he said I don’t think so.  I said.  “AMEN.” Daddy asked to go home.  My husband and MIL took him back to the MC.  I don’t know if he know that the woman in the casket was his wife but he had a beautiful funeral for her.  Sometimes fiblets work sometimes they backfire and sometimes they have a silver lining.    We had a wonderful celebration of her life the next day.  My SIL told the story about Daddy’s “funeral” to those who attended Mother’s funeral as a way of explaining why Daddy was not in attendance.    I will miss my Mother very much.  I have shared her primary caregiver duties with my brother for the last four and a half years.  TBI is different from AD but so similar in so many was.  I may not post often but I have learned so much by reading.  Many of Mother’s symptoms were those of FTD since that is where the injury was.  Johanna thank you for all of your insight.  I don’t know how to say thank you to everyone on this message board who have unknowingly helped me.  I will still be here for my Dad and will need your help in the future.

And the Alzheimer’s Association a leading research advocacy and patient support organization has posted on its website “Despite the concerns and complications we believe it is valuable to the Alzheimer field — to the pursuit of better Alzheimer diagnostics treatments and preventions — to have this product more widely available.”     But the Alzheimer’s Association isn’t entirely unbiased. Since 2008 it has received $1.6 million from Lilly. And in 2012 it received more than $4 million from all drug companies — many of which are selling Alzheimer’s drugs...     To make things more confusing while colloquially called an “Alzheimer’s test” the scan doesn’t diagnose Alzheimer’s dementia — it only determines the presence of amyloid. And our understanding of the connection between the two is shaky. While everyone who has Alzheimer’s also has amyloid [actually not true--everyone with Alzheimer's disease has at least the amyloid precursor protein not all have amyloid] not everyone with amyloid has Alzheimer’s dementia. Almost a third of cognitively normal elderly people have these protein clusters in their brains. On the scan they would light up. But those patients don’t have Alzheimer’s dementia and we don’t know how likely they are to develop it in the future. Imagine the anguish of that error.       Even if it could diagnose Alzheimer’s it probably wouldn’t make much difference to patients. Currently there are five drugs on the market that treat dementia. None can cure the disease. None can change the downward trajectory of cognition. At best they can relieve the symptoms of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s for about six to 12 months. And let’s not forget these drugs all have side effects like fatigue dizziness and pain.       At the very least Alzheimer's organizations in this country should have made their ""clients"" aware of the natural products that partially ameliorated Alzheimer's disease in human beings.  At the very best they should have aggressively pushed for the testing of these products to determine their effectiveness either singularly or in combination.  If only a drug will do it very well may take a decade or more before there is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's.           http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/alzheimers-anxiety.html",False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147502099,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her issue is she likes to pay attention to our bird and not pay attention to where her feet and body are going... down she went. I have to say she falls really well. She covered her head and almost rolled into a gentle fall. No thud! No marks on her body at all. No pain anywhere. I was going to call 911 but I waited and she was ok. I called her doctor and spoke with her nurse and she told me what to watch for. I was poking at her for 3 days and nothing.            So yesterday afternoon I noticed she winced a bit. I asked if something was wrong and she told me her hip area was sore... OH NO! It was 4:30 so I put her in the car and we went to the Urgent Care center at her primary care's medical building. It was almost pleasant. Doctor was very nice. He was very patient with her. Her hip joint moved easily. He thought she probably bruised/inflamed her bursa. But he did an X-Ray to be certain and thankfully nothing broken. The radiologist will look at the film this morning but he was certain of his diagnosis.           It was now after 6pm not the best time for a stage 7 dementia patient...

Mom is now in a facility and I am not coping well.,My mom is now in a lockdown facility as of Friday.  This past Monday she was checked into the hospital to first evaluate her then to be transported to a facility for a 30 day evaluation.       I was out of town for this process on vacation and my sister and father handled the logistics of this process.  I am normally highly involved in these matters in my mom's care but this time I took a back seat and left.  The last time I seen my mother was over a week ago.  At that time it did not hit me that when I said goodbye to her that from that point on she would no longer be living in her home the next time I am able to see her.      While on vacation I was able to disconnect from what was going on in my personal life.  I returned home yesterday and reality is starting to him me really hard.  I am having extreme anxiety attacks worse than I have ever experienced.  I am crying uncontrollably more times than not and this is very out of character for me.  I am not sure why I am crying so much as I had made peace with the fact that mom was going to be placed before I left.  We as a family had decided this was best.     If anyone out there has experienced this and can shed some light on this I could really use it right now.  I don't have any regrets.  I did feel bad for leaving while this was going on but over the last several years me and my family have put our lives on hold.  The majority of my vacation time I have taken over the last two years have involved caring for mom.  This trip was five months in the planning and have complete confidence in my sister picking a good place which she did a great job.      I am feeling very lost as each week I would spend at least three to four days with my mom.  Now I cannot see here per the instructions of our doctor to allow mom time to adjust to her new environment.  I am dying inside as I want to be with her but staying away is best.  My head says that I am doing the right thing by not visiting but my heart is breaking.  My siblings live out of town but my sister visits frequently and is here for now.  She is leaving on Saturday and then it is just my family and dad to continue this journey.       This situation is different for me as my life for several years now as been about mom and caring for her.  I feel lost because I have not had much of a life outside of caring for her then trying to take care of my family as well.  I am grieving for my father who now has to start living life without mom in the house.  His pain is much greater than anyone else and I know this.  I do well to put on a brave face in front of him but as soon as I get on my own I melt down.       My sister is having a rough time which is understandable because she has had one of the worst weeks of her life getting mom situated and helping my dad. I am trying to be sympathetic to that as I can only imagine how tough last week was for her.  I do know because there have been times I have had to walk the valley alone with caring for mom sitting 24/7 for a week straight beside her hospital bed as all my family was in a different state being the strong one taking their phone calls updating them on the situation.  No one should ever have to do that alone it is brutal.      I don't have outside friends.  My comfort is my husband and he has been a champ through this.  This disease made it to where I lost all friends I had on the outside world.  My church family disappeared so of course that has made me bitter.  I am very religious and I know God is in this and will take care of my family but I have had a hard time praying.  When I try all I do is cry and all I can say is help me Lord.       Tomorrow is suppose to be my first day back at work and as of right now I don't see how it will be possible for me to return.  My co-workers are aware of my mom's situation becoming much worse and if they ask me how things are going with my mom I know the meltdown will happen.  I am a manager where I work so self control of my emotions is a must and I don't think I can do it.     Again I really could use some words of encouragement right now.,False,mitchem0829,2012-12-29,20.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501603,,,AlzConnected,,,

Then she started doing poorly - refusing to eat difficulty getting her to drink very weak and eventually unable to stand increasingly poor coordination increasing confusion and high blood sugars.  This started with her complaining strongly of pain in her upper abdomen and left side and also with some constipation.  Went to doctor today; he said it is failure to thrive and referred to hospice and to give her Milk of Magnesia every eight hours and call tomorrow if she still hasn't pooped.    I've been reading what I can find online about failure to thrive and I'm not sure three or four days of being poorly meets the criteria.  Also not crazy that many of the sites seem to think it stems from neglect which NO.  I'm not going to object to getting more help and as far into Alzheimer's as she is hospice is appropriate but it feels kind of like not being taken seriously due to age and Alzheimer's.  I emphasized the pain she's been in and asked what would be causing that and he said hospice will help with that.  I know that but it seems like abdominal pain has some kind of cause besides being in a declining state.  Anyway confused and unhappy with next stage of nearing death and with still not knowing how to help her.  Did try out different soft foods I could feed her and she ate pudding yogurt blueberries and apricots; she refused other favorites of cheese puffs and sandwich bits.  She was aware enough after eating the yogurt and some of the blueberries to feed herself a few of them.  She has difficulty finding her mouth when drinking and isn't able to use a spoon herself.

We r truly blessed. I took my mom to the hospital to see Brantley. Then last Thursday we helped them out and watch my other grandson so my son could be at the hospital. I kept telling my mother over and over to stay sitting. They have two large dogs and didn't want them to accidently take her down. However my son has one step down from living room to kitchen. Not sure if she forgot or what but she fell .  Hit her head on wall. Hurt her knee. Thank god nothin broken. Just badly bruised. Today I noticed as far as memory she is worse. I no when they are sick it makes ad worse. Can pain do the same?? I notice a decline her and it's been two days. And if so when her pain goes away will she do better?  I'm so exhausted. Some days I feel so helpless and want to put her in a home but It will kill me to do that.  For those thAt have followed my past post I first noticed a change in my mom a year ago after she fell.  Dr say MRI fine but she went downhill after that fall.

This is her 2nd time having it done.     Anyway I don't know if it happened a few hours later or the next day she has complained of really bad pain on the left side of her head. Temple ear top of the head back of the head and neck.   Her first EEG she never had any problems.   Since having that pain she lost weight.  She loves her tea and it's the only thing she'll have.   If Dad makes her something once she sees it she would refuse to eat even she said yes she'll have something.           So did anyone have their loved one have this after having EEG? My Dad and I are trying to make sense out of it. Plus it makes Mom's cognitive skills really went out of the window. She moans and cries then stop and start all over again. It's like she's speaking a different language making up words.           Or do you suppose this is a start of her going downhill?          I hope my sentences make sense or whatever I'm typing makes sense since I'm deaf.  That's the hardest part of wanting to help out that I cannot be the ears if she gets up at night.  Dad's the only one who can.  All I can do is help around the house and so on and love my Mom and Dad as much I can.          Thank you for reading.,False,Baidonnie,2013-11-16,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501752,,,AlzConnected,,,

She lives in assisted living in Florida with a very nice personal aide I'm in Texas and my brother is in NJ.    We should have moved her when my dad died but her cognitive impairment wasn't too bad then. She still swam every day and played bridge.    We thought she'd grieve for my dad and then resume her life with friends and activities etc. By the time we realized that wasn't going to happen she was settled in to assisted living and too weak to travel. We were afraid the stress of another move and a new place would be too much for her.    So we have visited her almost monthly (either my brother or I). Until this past summer she still knew who I was.    The last time I saw her was in July and she not only didn't know me she wouldn't interact with me and she just seemed angry and annoyed that I was trying.    She has been in hospice care since May 2011. She has wanted to die ever since my dad died but in the past few months she has become fixated on it asking constantly for a pill or for someone to help her pass.    This week she fell and fractured her hip. She is too old and frail for surgery so we are doing pain management. She is on morphine and refusing food and water.    I'm so conflicted. I feel like I should be at her side and I also feel like it won't make any difference to her she won't know who I am or that I'm there.    I think I'm angry at her for not trying harder when my dad died for giving up on life.        I don't know when to go. I have commitments in my life that won't allow me to just go and stay for the duration. If I go to see her now I may not be able to go back a short time later to put her to rest.         It's like I lost my mom three years ago when my dad died and it tears me up to see what she has become.        Does this make me a horrible person? Would lying to myself and pretending to be the devoted daughter and flying to her bedside be better?    I can't cry I can't care I love my mom but the body in that bed isn't my mom. I know she is being kept comfortable and not in pain and that is the most important thing.    If it were me I wouldn't want my children to see me that way.

She's only 65 though and is also being rather heavily medicated (under her GP's supervision) for pain and I'm concerned about the effect this may be having on her cognition. Her husband is her sole caregiver and he's also a (now non-practicing) physician so that complicates the situation: I live in England and have no idea where to begin to get my mother evaluated by another doctor near where she lives. Anyway! Thought I'd start by asking if anyone lives in that area and has experience with a doctor (a neurologist/geriatrician or even just a great family practitioner) whom they could recommend for patients with dementia. Traveling any distance by car is an issue for my mom at this point so the closer to Goldsboro the better: I think my stepfather may agree to a second opinion but the difficulty of getting my mother to a doctor will probably be cited as reason not to.

She was a near zombie. She did not even know who I was or even that I was standing before her.     I was able to place her in Dementia care at a adequate Facility. For the next two years I was dying inside.  They fed my wife Megastrone to bring her around while she did not know how nor would eat adequately. After approx. 3 weeks my wife began to recognize her surroundings. It was at this time that my wife still recognizing me wanted out of that Care Facility.      Her wishes were blazed with weeping until one day as I was departing my wife went into full crying and desperate mental loud appealing. At this moment I was frozen. Returning to my wife would dilute the attempts and authority of the employee Caregivers and also allow my wife the possible thought that what she had to do to get my attention was to cry and offer loud wailing. As this episode was taking place I was frozen. Fortunately a seasoned Caregiver told me ""Go"". I was still frozen. Then the second time ""Go"". This time I took the heart pained managerial route and realized the Caregivers knew more than I. I departed.     Even though that was four years ago that scene passes before my thoughts and the loud crying haunts me. To this day I felt as though I had thrown my wife away. But in reality I did not throw my wife away but rather placed her in a higher Caring Facility that I could not compete with in our home with me alone.      Today my wife cannot speak but rather mumbles incoherently. Most of the time she offers no sign of recognition of my presence. Sometimes she grasps my hand with pleading affection. But in reality I will never have my wife again and I did not ""throw her away"" but the scene from 4 years ago haunts me so bad.      To those who are considering placement do so. Since I have placed my wife my own life has grown somewhat back inside me. Today I know it would be impossible to care for my wife in our home to include even if I hired in-house Caregiver assistance.      Dementia is a full consuming disease stealing the life of both the Loved One and the Next of Kin. Unfortunately the better avenue of survival is to place the Loved One where 24/7 experience can handle a near unmanageable disease and the Next of Kin can allow some semblance of life to return.",False,Zolly,2011-12-15,2283.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501287,,,AlzConnected,,,

How do you know?,"Quick history on my mom.  She is 82 and has been in a memory care unit since just after Christmas assisted living apartment for almost a year before that.  Recently she has been in the various levels of stage six.  At the end of April she fell in the night and broke her nose but even worse she broke her neck.  She spent seven weeks in a skilled nursing care and returned back to her memory care unit thereafter.  The fall pushed her deeper into stage six where she often forgets who I am.  She was finally doing better physically and was just released from homebound therapy just two weeks ago.  We just decreased her care levels as she was walking on her own again with her walker.       Last Monday I got a call from her staff that she was in extreme abdominal pain so I took her to the ER where she was diagnosed with pancreatitis for no known  reason (that was fun to argue with the two doctors that she wasn't an alcoholic!).  Upon my urging she was also checked for a UTI which came back positive.  She spent the next three days in the hospital and quickly regained her strength and stamina and was released back to her memory care unit.  By the next day however she was refusing to walk and keeps saying her leg hurts.  She also complained about leg pain at the hospital and they ""scanned"" her legs and found nothing.  Her home staff have closely monitored her vitals and everything looks good.  She is just weak and won't have anything to do with walking.  I know pancreatitis is a very serious condition and takes a long time to recover from as she had a bout with it 14 years ago when she was very fit and long before she had ALZ.       My mom also has ""a fib"" heart condition which we are no longer treating (team of cardiologists from the hospital recommended this when she was in for the broken neck and her own cardiologist agreed).  She takes a daily aspirin in hopes of preventing a stroke and she is on medication for hypotension (in hopes of preventing falls from low blood pressure).       Mom has never wanted this disease to be a burden on anyone.  She used to call ladies from her church crying that she did not want to go through this disease (I had her placed on an antidepressant for that).  Last week in the hospital she cried in pain with blood work and she in one of her very clear moments told me that I take too good care of her because every time she wakes up she is still alive and that she wishes she could just be rolled down the hill.  This is reference to a cemetery that is ""down the hill"" from her old house.       Now her stomach is bloated and we are trying to treat possible constipation and her legs are swelling maybe because she is not walking around.  And the hospital said that she has COPD????  News to me.  I hate to even ask questions any more because when I do they just want to order more tests.     When is enough enough?  I cringe at taking her for more tests.  She just wants to be left alone.  I quit taking her on outings because she can't remember how to get in and out of car and is so unsteady I was afraid she would fall.  Now she can't even get up and down from her wheelchair without two people helping her.    How can I take her for more tests?

What a Month,"WARNING-LONG POST:  Today is exactly one month since my mom's discharge from the geropsych unit.  And what a frustrating one it's been.  Finally today we had a visit from the home health RN.  I thought I was going to have to commit a crime or something in order to get them here.       Timeline:     Sept 5:  Mom released from hospital with URGENT orders for PT and OT.  Suddenly quit walking in hospital.  Had been independently ambulating with good balance recovery up until 2nd week of August when she began falling.  Quit walking 3rd week of August while inpatient.     Sept 9:  Contacted PCP office to confirm referral for PT and OT evals.  No call back.     Sept 11:  First OP visit with psychiatrist.  Mom has not been sleeping since discharge.  Only maybe dozing 20 minutes at a time for total of 3 hours in a 24 hour period.  Adjusted meds.     Sept 12:  Mom becoming angry and violent again.  Calls to psych office.  Settled down late morning.  Decided to change med regiment back and monitor for 24 hours.     Sept 13:  Taken to emergent psych visit for aggressive behavior.  Still not sleeping.  Clearly exhausted but seems to wake up when entering REM rather than going all the way into deep sleep.  Added Olanzapine at night.     Sept 14:  Still not sleeping.     Sept 15:  Slept 7 hours!  Hooray!  Daytime behavior much better.     Sept 16:  Called PCP regarding PT and OT referrals.  Left message.  No call back.     Sept 17:  FU with psych.  Still sleeping better though will not sleep in own bed.  Don't know why fear of being alone?  Staff allowing her to sleep in recliner in living room.  Small med adjustment to Olanzapine.  Suspect UTI.  UA positive for infection.     Sept 18:  Called PCP left message.  Called again asked to speak with referral department.  Referrals not even ordered.  Vented frustration to referral coordinator.  Explained that she had been discharged with URGENT orders for PT and OT.  Said I was frustrated with poor care received by PCP.  Said I thought it bordered on negligence that they hadn't followed up on discharging physicians orders.  Meanwhile my mom's legs were swollen like overstuffed sausages and she was spending all day in a borrowed wheelchair and IN PAIN.  She said she would send referral today.     Sept 20:  Received call from PCP referral department.  Home health agency says mom needs a ""face to face"" with doctor before they will do evaluation.  Seriously?  I said that she was just discharged from hospital with these orders a couple weeks ago.  Wasn't that good enough?  She said that she would need to be seen by a doctor.  Meanwhile received approval for home health PT and OT from insurance company.  At least somebody was onboard.  However I became suspicious about the referral process because the reason listed was ""abnormal manner of walking"".  Seriously?  How about NOT WALKING AT ALL!!!  Holy cow.  Scheduled an appointment for ""face to face"" with different doctor in clinic. Done with PCP.     Sept 24:  Two hour appointment at doctor's office.  During the initial review with nurse at office she said that the doctor had a med student with her today.  Would it be OK if he observed?  (Not sure if those were here exact words but that's what my brain and the AFH owner's brain heard).  A few minutes later the med student entered by himself.  He introduced himself and said he'd be doing the exam.  Ummm....WHAT?  I said ""Are we not seeing Dr. XXXX today?""  And he said that yes but he'd do the initial exam discuss with her then she would come in to finish.  The AFH owner and I looked at each other.  How do we handle this?       OK we let him do the exam.  His people skills were awful but we managed to keep mom calm.  He clearly had zero experience with dementia patients.  It was a long and frustrating exam.  Including the questions it was about 40 minutes.  Finally the doctor came in.  I really like her but I think there is a certain environment and philosophy in that office of less is more.  She wouldn't order a follow up UA for my mom for reasons that I still can't figure out though she explained it.  My mom would have to have active symptoms in order to get a UA done.  Dementia patients don't often present with pain etc.  The AFH owner was frustrated.       Anyway we explained what our treatment goals were and that the discharging physician had ordered OT and PT we also felt that going out was too hard for her and we wanted home health visits as well as home health psych ARNP visits in addition to the OT and PT.  She was not transferring safely anymore and going out caused agitation and behavior problems in addition to the physical discomfort.  Seemed like we had her on board for this stuff but she didn't seem to know that these things could actually be done.  The AFH owner said she has had several people with my mom's insurance have these services done in the home.       I know this doctor has been in that practice for at least 10 years and it really bothered me that it appeared this was the first time she'd even heard of having these types of services provided in the home.  Thank goodness the AFH owner was with me.  There is nothing like personal testament to services.  If it had been me I would've been at a loss as to what was available to my mom as far as services in the home went.     Sept 30:  Received a call from XXXX clinic (30 miles away) that said they had received my mom's referral for PT and when could we schedule.  I asked if this was a home visit and she said no mom would have to come to the clinic.  WHAT?  I explained what we were looking for.  She said I should call her PCPs office again and maybe the home health agency.      Oct 1:  I called both.  Left a messge at PCPs office:  Please could you research your referral language. It seems there has been some kind of mistake or miscommunication.  We discussed home referrals for xyand z but somehow it had been sent to clinic for in clinic visits.  Please get back to me.  Called Home Health Agency:  Described entire situation at length.  Receptionist (poor thing for having to listen to me) wanted me to talk to their RN administrator who was on the phone.  She took my number and said she would be calling me.     Oct 2:  Missed call from PCPs nurse.  Voicemail said that she had spoken with Donna at Home Health Agency who  had denied my mom services because ""She has no skilled needs"".  OMG!!!  Are you kidding me?  I called PCPs office  and asked to please speak with the nurse that I think there has been some kind of communication error and I had just missed her call.       After being on hold for a few minutes the receptionist came back on the line and said nurse was busy but that she had left a detailed message for me.  I could leave a message on her voicemail if I had any additional questions but that her message was detailed and she had nothing else to add.  Yes PLEASE let me have her voicemail.  While I wasn't able to control the emotion that was clear in my voice I was able to control my actual language.  I asked How could she NOT have skilled care needs?  She stopped WALKING for crying out loud!!!!  Did the discharging doctor's orders mean NOTHING?  What had been in the referral narrative? (I used to write preauthorization requests so I know you write a narrative to support your request.  NOT brain surgery pretty simple to do).  I said it seems that there MUST be some kind of communication problem going on.  I said I'm sure it was clear that I was frustrated.  I asked what on earth do I have to do to get my mom the help she needs?  Please could she call me with answers to these questions.  I said I was going to call the home health agency again.     Call to home health agency:  I now had a name DONNA.  I called and asked for Donna.   Donna was put on the line.  I introduced myself and said that i had received a call from nurse she had just spoken to.  Wrong Donna.  Apparently there are two in that office.  Transferred to correct Donna.  I said that I thought there was some sort of horrible communication error going on.  Could she please look up my mom's referral info?  The doctor had written it with a reason of:  Dementia with behavior disturbance and aggression and that they don't provide services for that.  I said that is a separate issue!  Groaning my grief I exhaustively explained my mom's situation again.       By the time I was done I had the nurse just as upset with the PCPs office as I was.  She said the fact that my mom had been falling at all all the way back in August was reason enough for PT and OT evals not to mention she was housebound!  Yay!!  I finally had somebody who understood.  She said she would handle it.  She would call and talk to PCPs nurse and tell her HOW TO WRITE THE REFERRAL so she would get the services she needed.  I was so grateful I nearly burst into tears. Instead I just let them fall quietly and thanked her in a thick voice.  That night there was a message from her on my home phone letting me know she'd talked to PCPs nurse and that the wheels were in motion.  Praise the Lord.     Oct 3 5:45 pm:  Received a call from Donna (now thought of as ""My Angel"") at Home Health Agency.  She called because she said she just couldn't go home until she had this all straightened out for my mom.  She had been back on the phone to PCPs office again looking for said referral promised the day before.  She finally got it that afternoon and went right to work pushing it through and getting my mom scheduled for RN visit in two days (October 5 today).  She said she also requested that my mom be seen earlier if possible.  She said she just wanted to let me know.  She had heard the frustration and anguish in my voice and wanted to make sure I knew help was coming.  My eyes burn with tears again just thinking about it having someone care and help me instead of pushing and struggling and fighting for every inch.     That evening wrote a letter to psychiatrist.  I have NO faith that the PCPs office will correctly write referral for home psych ARNP visits.  Explained mom's difficulty with transferring etc but that she seemed pretty stable and was still sleeping pretty well albeit in a recliner. Asked if he would support the home psych ARNP visits to follow her mental health and psych meds.  Faxed to his office.     Oct 4:  Received call from psych RN at psych office.  They received my fax and were getting the home psych visits rolling.  It might take a couple weeks to get somebody out here but they'd do it.  Happiness relief gratitude.     Oct 5:  RN evaluation for my mom at 11:00 a.m. today.  Nurse was great and she has a history with the home my mom is at.  They love her said they were so happy when they saw her walk through the door.  Mom will be  having an RN visit 2x a week for a couple weeks then down to 1x per week.  She also ordered PT and OT to come.  The goal is to get her ambulating and get that edema under control.  I am so relieved.  I might be able to sleep now.     Folks I don't know how our frail elderly get any help without someone advocating for them.  If I hadn't had a clue as to how the whole referral process works I probably would've chalked it up to my mom actually not qualifying.       Fortunately I recognized the need for accurate narratives etc in the referral process.  That and the AFH owner reassured me that mom should certainly be getting these things that she's never had someone have so much trouble getting services.     If you think your LO needs something that they aren't getting don't give up until you get it for them.  It's work but eventually you'll find the right person to help you.     UGH!  Just looked at topic subject line....UPDAT   E    for crying out loud.  I hate misspelling things.",False,jooliet,2013-05-27,301.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147500850,,,AlzConnected,,,

I moves in with my grandparents about 3 months ago. My Papa has cancer and dementia and both are getting worse.   Just before we (my 4 year old daughter and I) moved in Papa had a blockage in his intestine caused by scar tissue from the radiation they did for the cancer. He came home after a month long stay in the hospital... was home 3 days... and fell and broke his hip. He had a rod put in his hip and spent another 3 weeks in the hospital and a rehab facility. He is home now but very weak. Weaker than he has ever been.      About 10 days ago while my grandma was at the grocery store he woke up from a nap. I went in to help him up and suddenly he couldn't remember anything from about the last 20 years or so. I talked him through it but he has not been the same since. Before that day he would have short times when he got tired or stressed that he would talk nonsence and get confused... that was the first time he really didn't know where he was. To make it worse it is almost like that incident flipped a switch. Instead of doing well with moments of confusion he is confused with moments of clarity instead.      Tonight was the worst though. He did not want help getting out of his chair. He did not want help getting to bed or into it. He did not want to stand or sit the way the Dr told him he has to because of his hip... and (according to him) my grandmother and I were stupid dumbasses for thinking he needed help. Finally got him in his room and sitting in his bed and for an hour I waited for him to finish fiddling with everything within reach... he finally laid down but was diagonal in the bed with his feet hanging off and his head not on the pillows (he also has steel rods in his neck so if it is not supported he wakes up in lots of pain) no amount of gentle coaxing would convince him to move. In the end he made me so mad that I just left him that way and left the room.  (My grandmother was in bed with him but she couldn't convince him to move either.) On my way out the door he called me stupid again and then yelled at me ""Just let me ask you one question!"" In a tone that said it would start another fight. I answered ""No Sir. If you don't want my help then you don't get o ask a question!"" He didn't say anything else that I could hear. I felt so bad foe finally snapping at him. It just hurt so bad to have him say those things. I have given up evwryrhing to help him... my husband lives 2 hours away and I only see him every other weekend I don't get to spend as much time with my daughter I started a Mary Kay buisness just before all of this happened and I have had to put it aside because I don't have time for it and to take care of him. And I am OK with all of that... until he starts acting like I don't care about him and don't want o help him.      I am just so frustrated. Sorry for the rant... like I said I don't have many people to talk to and I needed to vent. I know that tomorrow he won't remember any of this... and I guess that is my saving grace... he won't remember getting ugly with me but he also won't remember me snapping.... I will just have to do better tomorrow at staying calm no matter what he says...",False,TashaMagoo,2013-10-22,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147501179,,,AlzConnected,,,

Did an MRI but nothing showed other than very bad bruising.  My dad's buttockthighand hip were deep dark purple.  They did keep him for a few days then moved him to the Adult Behavioral area for physical therapy to help get him back on his feet.  Was there a week then they moved him to a local nursing home/rehab center and said he would be there approx. 3 weeks.

I will release her hand but keep my hand on her somewhere moving at least a finger to let my wife know that I am there.      In the approx. 90 minutes that I am visiting my wife may offer me 2 or 3 minutes of attention. Today I purposely surveyed the visit my attention her attention and the same window or other patient that she stares at during my visit. I tried to insert a psychological reason for my wife's apparent apathy but nothing concrete came to my mind. Upon my departure my wife functioned like it was just my stop to get off the bus.      I  visit 4 or 5 times per week allowing my wife to take the lead so that the visit goes according to her needs and her wishes. However I just cannot put my hand on the right rationale for my wife's apathy during our visits. My wife has pain and difficulty in walking so I cannot take her for a garden stroll around the gardens. My wife does not talk but rather mumbles in her own fashion.        Would anyone care to offer their opinion on what my wife is thinking or perhaps unable to think of?     My thanks.....,False,Zolly,2011-12-15,2283.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147500346,,,AlzConnected,,,

I know the limit use to be 4000 mg and was reduced from what I've read mostly because of concerns that people would overdose by taking too much tylenol which is included in a lot of OTC cold meds along w regular tylenol.     I know there is risk of liver problems from Tylenol.  Do your LO's doctors do any special monitoring for this since they are on the tylenol?  If so what labs do they take? This was a recent change so I don't have an immediate concern but I do want to keep my eye on it.      Also I was a little surprised about the increase because I thought nursing homes were sticking to this guideline but I could be mistaken. I know hospitals won't prescribe this much.....( Also surprised because I didn't think mom was having that many pain problems- but that's another story.) Would appreciate your thoughts.     Thanks  Caroline,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147500361,,,AlzConnected,,,

My parent's marriage was lousy - to put it mildly. Dad had numerous affairs. Mom had tremendous emotional pain. The details (once I learned them) made my mouth drop open. I knew my family was dysfunctional but it blows my mind what my mother put up with. Dad is 86 an insensitive overbearing egotistical control freaking alcoholic who has survived leukemia and now deals with chronic lyme. He doesn't have the stamina for full-time care anymore so I'm here taking care of both of them. Dad loves mom &amp; mom loves dad (or so she says) hence the 63yrs of ""wedded bliss""... it's complicated lol. But my mother spends much of her time re-living the worst times of their marriage. Sometimes she gets ""stuck"" - she believes it's still 1970 - something - and the affairs are ongoing - today. Or she fixates on the pain and the other women (plural) and try as I might I can't get her to let it go. The worst is when she's 'stuck'. It's heartbreaking. I don't know which is better - to talk to her as if it is still real or to try to bring her back to the present. Sometimes if it's just a bad mood and general anger at the man I can distract her with various means: music tv changing the subject etc... but sometimes NOTHING WORKS! So many of the posts here discuss loving husbands who are devoted to their ALZ wives. My dad loves my mom I believe that but his reaction to her when she brings up things that happened 2030or 40 years ago is less than stellar. Did I mention he's self-centered? Proud? God forbid he gives anybody - even his wife - an apology! Not gonna happen! He gets angry and defensive - so then I have a powder keg to live in. I've done some research and read that ALZ will cause the brain to forget the mechanics of life - the events people etc but the emotional imprints will stay until the end. God help me!  It breaks my heart sometimes to see her crying her eyes out - re-living the emotional pain over and over again. This is of course on top of all the other things that go along with the disease... Has anyone else dealt with this?

1225,6210a3517b65de9a5b67a25d,2147499818,2013-08-21 18:51:00,Nursing Home doctor advice,"Hi All     I'd like to do a reality check and see what others experience with their LO primary nursing home doctors.       Is it common for nursing home primary doctors to not consult with their LO's regular nurses to get their input on assessing pain or other issues?  What about asking the LO's POA?  Or even physical therapists that have worked on them in the past?     I ask because my mom's dr requested a family mtg to discuss pain management. So the mtg was today.  Part of me wishes I had called her to question why she wanted the mtg because I thought mom was doing pretty good!!! and wasn't seeing much of an issue nor were any of the nurses who I check with all the time including aides restorative therapy etc.. But out of courtesy to her I thought I would go ahead with the mtg and see what she had to say.      It was awkward. I felt on the spot because the dr put forth her concerns that she wanted to treat mom's pain which she thought was getting worse but there had been ""roadblocks"" in the past ( me limiting the amount of vicodin she got daily during bad back pain issue last winter) and she wanted to see what we could come up with to address this.  The mtg also included the Nursing home administrator( new) the DON ( SW was sick) the activities director and mom's nurse who joined halfway in and I wasn't expecting any of them except the SW and dr so it was a surprise.       So though I was uncomfortable I tried very hard to not negate the dr's point of view but how I thought mom was actually doing better since the back pain issue and yes there was a little bit more pain perhaps when I would prod her. I also shared my past experiences with mom and her pain  and horrible reactions to pain meds ( she knew a little bit about it) and that I learned from an old physical therapist to assess mom's pain by her actions and facial expressions AND if she volunteers it without me asking.  I also mentioned that her new physical therapist had told me she thought mom was having more pain because she wasn't walking as much and her muscles were getting tight.  By the way mom is still with it enough to tell me if something is bothering her so when she hurts bad enough you know and that's when I try to get more involved with it.      Though I said all of the above I think everything shifted when mom's nurse came into the room and shared his impressions. He said he thought she was pretty comfortable and improved since the back issue!!!!  And he also said you had to kind of prod her to find out about her pain. So yes I do think mom probably puts up with a certain amount but it in no way seems to affect her ADL's and she still participates fully in all the activities and eats well!       Once he spoke the dr shifted directions and started inquiring about more physical therapy or doing a pain assessment which I'm much more comfortable with. We also talked about increasing her walking a bit more. The DON seemed pretty responsive to all of that.  I also mentioned that we were trying lavender oil based on what a massage therapist had used and dr was okay with that.      Dr did ask me how I felt if mom's pain got worse and I said I would try to be more flexible and open to stronger meds.  ( back story- I spent two years  on and off in hell trying to unravel a multitude of medication issues with my mom in her old nursing home some were pain meds and it was difficult to figure out what the problem was. She had several psych hospitalizations and we were even discussing hospice at one point because she was in such a bizarre mental state refusigng care hitting biting not eating etc. )       Anyways even though we came to a solution I am comfortable with I'm still really bothered that the doctor seemed out of touch and hadn't checked with other staff. I can deal with that she might not want to  call me and ask my impressions but to not even ask the nurse when you are there at the facility? HUH? Just feeling a bit uneasy with the dr at this point and her judgement.       The other issue is that she only comes to see mom every other month as she is part time and the other visit is by a nurse practitioner one of two. In fact mom's issues have sometimes been handled by the doctor's partner and I worry about a lack of continuity as it seems like there has been 3 or 4 people involved and I'm not sure everything is getting through to her doctor. Or that the dr isn't as involved as she would be were she full time. And.....this is the practice the SW recommended I use as the other main affiliated practise wasn't great at returning calls and SW didn't think they were as responsive as these folks. SIGH     So- are they all like this? Could I expect a more tuned in doc or is this the norm? They come in ask the patient a few questions and take off without asking the nurses etc and god forbid the POA?  I'd really like to know. Right now I feel like finding another doc.   There are a few other things that have happened with the doc or one of the other partners that have bothered me and I'm just starting to question if this is the best fit.  I know I need to calm down but I would really LOVE to hear from some of you about your own experiences. Can I expect better than this or should I learn to adjust and try to improve my ability to communicate with this doctor?

Friday night was tough with the delirium but I got him to bed.  Saturday he was in a lot of pain but I kept up his meds.  Delirium again in the evening but manageable. So long as I was in his sight he was fine.    Today has been horrible.  He was fighting sleep all day.  Just out and out refusal to do anything.  We had dinner and while it was late (7:30'ish) he had it in front of him.  He kept sighing and rubbing his eyes and wouldn't eat.  I got him to eat some of his food and when it was meds time he out and out refused to take them.  Our daughter tried to get him to take them and I then reentered the room (I had to walk away because I was getting frustrated) and tried to console him and get him to take them and he refuses.      What should I do?,False,MissyinMd,2012-12-09,12.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147500068,,,AlzConnected,,,

My 81 year old mother was diagnosed with Alzheimers over 3 years ago.  My mom was never a very happy or affectionate person always somewhat solemn. She had many tragedies in her life starting with the passing of her mother when she was only 13 years old.  Being the eldest child still in the home she had to care for her 2 younger sisters.  A story or complaint that she has spoken about ever since I can remember.  Mom and Dad married in 1950 and we also had to hear the constant complaining of how rough it was with my Dad drinking and partying in the early years before he settled down.  In the 70's she had to deal with my brother's drug addiction and constant incarcerations that lasted until he got clean in 1998.  Mom has also lived with guilt that she passed on retinitis pigmentosa to her 3 sons and 3 grandsons.  I have always felt that mom was depressed but she refused to seek treatment because she didn't believe in it.  She said they would give her pills and she couldn't take them because of her constant years of preaching to my brother about his drug use.  As much as we tried we couldn't convince her that it was different.          In 2003 my older brother passed away from liver disease at age 50 and in 2009 my youngest brother passed away at age 45 from cancer.  Mom never recovered from either of their passings.  She became more and more depressed and distant.  She was never happy and always wanted to be alone and would stay sitting in the dark for hours at a time.    In 2010 she began repeating herself and we noticed her memory and mood changes.  Her eating habits changed and we also noticed her house was not as clean as it used to be.  We weren't sure if it had to do with her vision becoming more limited due to the rp.  I took her to a neurologist where she was diagnosed with early alzheimers.  In 2011 she was prescribed Namenda 20mg and last year Donezepil 10mg was added.    A few months ago we noticed she was becoming angry combative and very abusive mostly towards my Dad.  It almost seems like is afraid of her.  We noticed she's also becoming more forgetful and her conversations are very limited.  She also started complaining about leg swelling and knee pain so she began limiting her walking. The ortho Dr. has started removing fluid from the knee and is talking knee replacment which is very traumatizing mentally for her.  When it was suggested that she be sent to a rehab facility my Dad refuses to allow her to have the surgery because he's afraid she won't come home again.    Last month Dad finally confided in us that she had not been sleeping at night.  He said that she is up all night moving things around.  She has also begun talking to my brothers that passed away and even attempts to cook for them.  The last few weeks she has had episodes of seeing other people and conversing with them mostly in spanish a language she only spoke growing up at home.  She has not recognized me at times but says my laugh is just like her daughter's.  She lasted like that for about 3 days.  She was good for about a week and now it seems like the hallucinations are beginning again.  The Dr. started her on Seroquel a little over 2 weeks ago and we thought it was working but now I'm not sure.  She and my Dad live alone and I'm convinced he doesn't always tell us the truth about what's going on.  I don't know if she's threatened him or if he just doesn't want her placed.    I'm not sure what stage she's at.  My sister thinks it's a 6/7 and I'm starting to think she might be right.  As for the swelling in her legs the Dr. said it could be from decreased kidney function.  Maybe our prayers will be answered and something else will take her so that Dad won't have to go through much more of this.  I'm a 3 time cancer survivor and now I know why my work wasn't done yet. I still have to take care of Mom and Dad.  As for the hallucinations we can only hope that maybe she really does see my brothers and that they've come back for her.,False,deedeeyit,2013-09-01,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147500069,,,AlzConnected,,,

The first night was rough he forgot a lot of things about his home and was very confused.  Bedtime was a horror show as he wanted to rearrange things in the bedroom and bathroom.  However after a pretty solid got up twice 9 hours of sleep he was much better the next day and subsequent days.  There are still bits of confusion cannot remember where his bedroom is but he has gotten better since being home.  He just now has an issue with what I think are migraine headaches.  Light loud noises bother him and he says his vision is not clear.  He also has pain over his eye brows.  We're seeing his eye doc and PCP this week.    He keeps dwelling on what got him into the hospital.  He feels bad about the situation and keeps ruminating over how he could of done things differently.  It starts to depress him and we tell him to put it behind him.  He's home now and back with his family.  He and mom had a long talk told her that she is his everything and afraid that after what happened she will leave him.  He's happy to be walking without the restrictions PT was putting on him.  Fortunately he is not wobbly.    I though still feel like I'm walking on eggshells I'm not his primary care giver...that's his wife.  However I'm afraid to leave the two of them together for a long period of time.  He has shown no aggression since he has been home.  She refuses to hire additional help and feels she can do all of this on her own.  I have to return to my office next week and feel like I need to move past this as well.  What the psych MD said about his aggression keeps playing over and over again in my head.  He's my dad but I know this dementia has changed him he'll never be the same again and over time get worse.

1229,6210a4257b65de9a5b67a587,2147500027,2013-08-30 22:49:00,The story of my dad so far. (long post ahead),"I am typing it this way since the profile intro thing wouldn't let me type the whole story of my dad's diagnosis. First there are a few things you need to keep in mind:  First of all before anyone thinks I'm approaching this whole thing wrong I have Asperger's Syndrome. I am a high functioning case and I grew up a lot in the last few years and now that my dad is ""going back in time"" it hurts to see him becoming what I used to be.  Secondly he is a man of dignity and he's trying to hold onto the last shred of it for dear life. It's pretty obvious and it's frustrating to watch it happen. He insists he's only temporarily away from work and that he'll hire an attorney to get his driver's license back.  Okay. Glad I got that out of the way. Here's where I talk about my dad. It requires lots of backstory.   He was born in 1942 and his birth mom was very frail. Giving birth to him made her worse and she died about a year or two after he was born. His dad remarried and my grandma died in 2005 from stroke complications (and the last week of her life she was bedridden and didn't eat from what I remember.). The reason I bring his step mom up is because she had dementia. When we began to notice dad's memory going away we honestly thought it would be dementia because we don't have Alzheimer's in our family history. What I am wondering is if my biological grandmother managed to live a life of longevity what if she developed it? Only the heavens know which makes this frustrating and it makes me scared for myself. I have so many negative medical traits in common with my dad already...  Anyway when my dad was a little boy he fell out of a moving vehicle head first. He was okay nothing was broken but collectively the entire family has noticed he has been foggy ever since. He's probably had sleep apnea the same amount of time I have been alive (I will be 26 in late November). In 1998 he got in a major car accident when he was driving over to the elementary school to pick me up. His car was totaled and he had several injuries where he tried to mask it with visits to chiropractors until he was ready to sacrifice work for a year to be in recovery for surgery. In 2010 he finally had a spinal fusion surgery in San Francisco (no local doctors wanted to even touch his case. We're from Fresno.) but it made his pain worse and we believe that just before the surgery when he was all ""drugged up"" on pain meds for pre-op preparations a few months before that THIS was when the Alzheimer's actually developed and that the post op experience is what accelerated its development. From the research I have conducted I believe he is stage 3.   He got lost driving at night last November when trying to drive to his sister's house. It's been the same address for at least two decades so to suddenly miss where it is was quite odd for us to find out. A good samaritan helped him get back to us and so we figured out a way to hide his keys for a week. He was LIVID.  Mom took him to a memory doctor a few months ago and he took the 3 hour memory test. Dad did not do very well on it and the followup was March 29th 2013: we found out it was Alzheimer's that day. To this day he doesn't know that mom told me and the rest of the family because he'd be very angry if anyone found out. He's independent enough to know but he also forgot about the diagnosis but every time mom brings it up it's like a new revelation to him. He doesn't want anyone to know but they needed to know. It is absolutely horrible. Today was actually his wedding anniversary with mom. The last three years he has forgotten it and mom had to bring it up.  I just wanted to tell you our story. I have Asperger's Syndrome so to see him not being memory or detail oriented bothers me. Lately I have been finally letting go to the point where I don't snap at him but I actually have a giant ball of paper with every single thing on it that I wish I could say to his face on the inside.   My dad can take care of himself just fine but there are some things that get frustrating. He puts dishes away in the wrong spots he can't remember where things are and one time he even asked ""don't we have a microwave?"". He spends most of his days watching TV at a loud volume since his hearing is going having very creepy conversations with the cat and sometimes listening to the radio while watching TV simultaneously. We know he can't follow TV shows that well anymore so he usually ends up watching Pawn Stars or some seriously trashy TV shows and whodunnit reenactment programs. On top of this Alzheimer's diagnosis dad also is suffering from Diverticulosis. If any of you are eating while reading this I'll spare you the details. All you have to know is that my dad has ZERO willpower when it comes to dieting and EVERYTHING on the no-list is everything he loves. So he not only forgets what he can and can't have we also have concluded he's sick and tired of the recovery diet to care. It is square one every single day and we think he'll end up in the hospital at the rate this is going. (at least they'd be able to monitor everything?)  So yeah. I knew that would be a long post but I needed to get it off my chest. I'm Anne. I'm 25 a musician long-time engaged to my college sweetheart and I am a recent graduate from college. I am unemployed and living with my parents and I'm trying to get a job so I can finally get married and move out.   The tragic journey has begun for us and although we're overall ""handling it"" we know we'll need more help along the way. I hope my mom joins soon. This place sure has lots of resources for us!

I called the home agency ar 4:20 am to see if it was okay to give mother Imodium. The nurse on call said to give her two. So I did and when it got 9am I placed a call to her MD . I told nurse she had loosecbm 3 times got Imodium at 4:20 am and was left with stomach pain. She wanted to know if mothercwasvever constipated and I said yes and got miralax . She wanted to know when the last time was and it was Wed. and she had results. That afternoon the nurse called back told me doctor said to give her Imodium and Tylenol for her stomach pain.   At six tonight mother tells me she things she could throw up. I go get her some meet roll and she takes it and soon after starts coughing like she is strangled. She finally got in her recliner. Then we managed to get her into bed. I am noticing how she is so more confused not eating as much lately tired sleeps later more often having bad dreams. I don't know if it is her condition or the new blood pressure medicine. She has been taking the metropolol(sp) the month of Aug. we go to the cardiologist for her first visit Friday. The visiting nurse wants it to be her heart or her dementia that us causing this I am confused since I am her all the time. The nurse wants to pin me down about when some symptoms started.

While she was in the hospital they found double pneumonia and she developed dysphagia.  Both were 'treated' (she had extensive therapy and swallowing difficulties were mostly reversed) but she was hospitalized again for extreme swelling &amp; complications of CHF.       Gram went from an extended-stay rehab into ALF and along with that she lost any concept of day time month etc.  The 'busy hands' started and she would constantly shred napkins and papers. She became withdrawn had hallucinations (fights with herself in the bathroom mirror) and was having drastic mood swings.      Eventually gram came home and has a caregiver with her. Due to sciatica her mobility is now a real issue and we have had to take knobs off the stove lock the basement door and block the 2nd floor stairs so she can't go up and down.  She has also become a 'nester' and will hide things in places she can't remember leaving us to find piles of stuff later (mostly paper clips hair clips pens pencils and other small objects).       I describe all these symptoms because we have yet to get a true diagnosis from a physician.  In fact we have been through 3 different PCPs 2 visits to the ER and we still have to wait three months to see a true geriatric specialist.  The PCPs have done NOTHING to help us get a diagnosis. No referrals to neuro no consults and (worst of all) two of them have prescribed Aricept and Nemenda without really knowing if this is Alzheimer's. (Gram's symptoms as they are are rapidly fluctuating and there are days she appears almost completely normal.  Caregiver states she is anywhere between a stage 1-6 at any point during the week having been through this with her own mother and we feel the worst times came when we started the meds...which has since been discontinued and she is remarkably better mentally now that the side effects have dissipated).      I was told by the AZ Association Physician Outreach yesterday that if we can't get answers through her doctors we need to visit a Diagnostic Center and do so quickly. However I've been told it's sometimes weeks or months to see a doctor there either. Does anyone have any advice on how I should approach the Diagnostic Center? Do I need to take all her medical records myself? Can they and should they get access to them if the only thing we keep having done are blood draws and urinalysis and taking lots of Tylenol for her nerve pain?  Should I expect a long wait for an appointment and if so should I just say forget it and wait until October to see the geriatric specialist?  It feels like we are being spun in circles and the PCPs have been so disinterested in helping us out just because of her age.  They see us coming and can't wait to get her back out of the office to just be done with her.   Any advice?,False,pagirl26,2013-08-15,7.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499678,,,AlzConnected,,,

There are six residents.  Her doctor prescribed Lorazepam to help with the transition.  We are giving her 1/3 of the prescribed dosage .5 mg in the a.m. and in the p.m.  She is also taking Seroquel 100 mg in a.m and p.m.     In two days she fell 3 times.  The first time was early in the a.m. next to her bed.  She hit her face but nothing was broken thank goodness.  When I picked her up the next day to take her to a hair appointment the aid was putting her right shoe on and mom was in clearly in pain.  I asked if she hurt her foot and the aide said mom said it happened when she fell the day before.  She said they were going to monitor it for 72 hours. Hmmm.  She didn't complain of any pain the day before at all and she was checked in the ER.     When I took her to her hair appointment it was clear to me that her balance was way off and the foot was really hurting contributing to her poor balance.  She isn't very aware of her pain and says she's fine but says it hurts when she walks.  When we got back to the home I took her shoe and stocking off to check it out.  Her right big toe was really bruised and she had some general swelling on the top of her foot.  I told the aid that I was going to call her doctor and see if they could see her if not I would take her to urgent care.  I explained my concerns about this really affecting her balance and that if she was a fall risk before she was even more so now.     The doctor things that it is either a really bad jam or possibly a broken toe.  I was stumped as to what had happened.  The doctor told her she should use a walker to help with her balance until the foot is healed and that we would need to get it x-rayed.  I took her back to the home and got her out of the car.  As I turned to open the door she stepped off the driveway into the grass on her bad foot totally went down face first.  Fortunately she landed in the grass.       I called for the aid to come help she said she would need to get somebody else to help my mom up.  She called another aid (who was at her home not at the facility) so we had to wait about 10 minutes for the other aid to get there.  My mom was not really injured other than an abrasion to her face thank goodness.  I asked for a wheelchair transport into the house for my mom and said I was just going to go get her walker and bring it up.  I said I also wanted to bring the bedside commode because mom would certainly wake up in the night and try to walk to the bathroom likely falling again.       I need to back up a bit here.  In another post I mentioned my mom getting up to the bathroom in the night and removing her depends then getting back into bed with no drawers on waking up later and ""leaking"" all the way to the bathroom.  According to the caregivers she gets angry and upset when anyone tries to help her during this time.  The overnight caregiver has the job of preparing the next day's meals and cleaning bathrooms/mopping during her shift.  According to a couple of the caregivers mom is sometimes not letting people come in to do the nighttime cleaning.  They were already planning to move her to another room that does not have a bathroom in it.     I had a frustrating conversation with the caregiver who came to help.  I was discussing what we needed to do ""right now"" and she was talking about the move her concerns about my mom slipping on wet wood floor etc.   I said OK but I need to talk about right now.  The move will happen in a couple days but we need to decide how to handle ""right now"".  I explained that she didn't have these horrible balance issues before the Lorazepam.  That we were treating one set of issues and were creating a whole other set of issues.       I finally left to get my dad's old walker and the bedside commode.  While I was picking them up I got a call from the owner of the facility.  She was trying to reassure me that while ""the girls looked young they had a lot of experience"" and that I needed to trust them.  What?  Am I now getting drawn into drama?  More on that later.  During this conversation I explained why I took mom to the doctor today.  I said that her foot hadn't been like that the day before (I also told that to the caregiver I had the frustrating convo with and she said ""No she was limping pretty bad yesterday"".  Um no she wasn't.  Not when I took her to the hospital and not when I visited later in the day.  I would've noticed.     So during this phone call the owner explained that mom had had ANOTHER fall after the one that took her to the ER.  She tripped on a floor transition strip or something and said she was fine and didn't want anyone to be called etc.  OK WHY WAS I NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS!!!!!  I ASKED IF SHE HURT HER FOOT!!  The thing that really bugged me was this:  The owner said:  ""Well you know she wears those slipper stockings.  It would be better if she didn't have those kinds of stockings at all.""  Essentially blaming my mom's socks on this tripping incident.  I explained to her that she didn't have these problems before the Lorazepam.  She said that she probably was falling but onto the carpet at her house and that she wasn't getting hurt.     Stockings don't make you trip.  A shuffling step makes you trip.  A shuffling step she did not have two weeks ago before the Lorazepam.  Here are the other things that are really really bothering me:     1.  We don't know why my mom fell the first time but it is being ""blamed"" on her peeing on the floor and slipping in it.  Nobody saw pee on the floor and the way she fell doesn't seem to fit a ""slipping"" type fall.  I think she fell out of bed.  But we will never know for sure.  2.  The first night my mom stayed there her bed slipped across the floor and blocked the door.  I had to get rubber stops to put on the feet of her bed to keep it from slipping. You could literally push it halfway across the room by bumping it with your knee.  This then turned into her ""pushing things in front of the door to keep the night girl out of her room"".  What?  3.  I wrote a ""history"" of my mom for them when she moved in.  My mom is old white and very small town.  Never worked housewife very little exposure to any kind of minority in her 80+ years. I have never ever heard her use a racial slur but she does have what I consider small minded ""antiquated"" ideas about things.  So I mentioned this in my letter. What I was talking about was something like this which my mom actually said once at the rehab facility:  ""There was a black man who came to my room to introduce himself and tell me they'd be having music in that other room.  He was very nice."" She would always say minorities were ""very nice"" as if it was unexpected.  That is what I was talking about in my history.  This then turned into my mom not letting the night girl into her room because she was Hispanic!!!  They said they were surprised that she wasn't having a problem with K**** who happens to be black.  WHAT??  My mom doesn't want anybody in her room at night because it scares her and she thinks EVERYBODY is trying to steal her stuff.  She has DEMENTIA!!!  4  Professionalism of one caregiver there who I think is the drama queen of all the above being turned into major issues.  She tells me in explicit detail and in front of my mom and other residents every time my mom says something mean and swears.  Such as ""She said she thought that was a bunch of B***S*** her words"".  Um yeah I am embarrassed for my mom that her brain to mouth filter is missing and she can swear like a sailor when mad.  But even if she said this in front of the other residents should the caregiver be repeating it in front of the other residents and my mom?  I think not.  What does it accomplish?     Now unfortunately my mom could never be accused of having ever had a sweet disposition.  She has always been negative and quite bluntly pretty mean.   The disease has made it all worse.  Now the owner who I happen to think is really wonderful with the residents is going on a much needed vacation starting tomorrow.  I feel like we're still in crisis mode here and I'm going to be left dealing with a bunch of CNAs who are 25 and under.  It really is only the one who I think is an issue but she seems to be able to persuade the others of her misguided ideas.     My mom is angry hurting and very likely depressed as well as drowsy from the Lorazepam.  She looks awful.  Today was a big family barbecue with an ""Old Time Fiddle"" band playing.  She'd been looking forward to it for days but she wound up sleeping through it barely aware we were even there or that the music was playing.     They think she may need MORE Lorazepam.  I think the Lorazepam is now contributing to some of her angry behavior and we may need to look at an antidepressant and decrease or discontinue the Lorazepam.  I am a pretty strong forthright person when push comes to shove so I think that I have intimidated or made some of the caregivers mad with my opinions on the whole thing.  But it is really hard to listen to a kid who has been living an adult life for a whole 5-7 years tell me about my mom.  I respect people who have insight no matter what their age but I know too well that so many of these girls are really not super intuitive and feel like they are experts though I have probably spent more time studying dementias than they have.     So I plan to try to get through this week and then ask for a care conference when the owner returns.  I want to sit down with the caregivers who are reporting these behaviors so I can weed out the drama from the reality.  I feel like I am getting two different stories depending on who I am talking to.  I am feeling super frustrated and angry.",False,jooliet,2013-05-27,301.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499561,,,AlzConnected,,,

She was not happy.     She went on to tell me that she needs a perm in her hair and needs to go to her ""regular"" salon which is around 8 minutes from our house.  I told her I would come and pick her up on a Saturday and take her to the salon then take her back after.  And she said I'll come home Friday night and stay there then go to get my hair done Saturday from there.  I said no you can't do that.  She said what?!  I can't even come home for one night?!  And I explained again what the doctors said and that if anything happened then I would be responsible.  She was not happy and hung up shortly after.     My sister went to visit her last night and my mother told her that I had told her that she was NEVER going home again.  Never!  I never ever told her that.  I would NEVER tell her that.  My home is her home - she and my dad and my husband son and I have lived together in our home for the past 16 years although my dad died 2 1/2 years ago and our son is in college so it's been just the 3 of us for the last 2 1/2 years.     She also told my sister that if she knew she was going into a ""nursing home"" that she would have appreciated choosing the place herself.     At this point everyone seems to think that I/we should tell her that the assisted living facility is her home right now that is where she lives right now.    The nurses at the ALF believe that my mom has been looking at her stay there as a mini vacation with some rehab thrown in and of course new furniture and a new big TV!  and is now beginning to realize that maybe.... this may be for longer than she would like... and she is pushing back and becoming angry.  She told me that if her falling is part of why she has to stay there then she just wouldn't tell anyone when she fell anymore.     What are our options?  What do we tell her?  Can she just walk out of the place call a cab hitch a ride home?    I do have a durable POA as well a Medical POA and a letter from her memory care dr stating that due to having Alzheimer's she can no longer make medical or financial decisions for herself.      I don't know what to do what to tell her what not to tell her.    What are her ""rights"" - can she just walk out of the place?  And come back home?  Because none of the problems that necessitated putting her there have changed it was a catastrophe waiting to happen on a daily basis for her.",False,TerryD59,2012-07-11,93.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499479,,,AlzConnected,,,

Please advise.,"Dad is heartbroken about placing mom and moving from his home.  ""This is not how it was supposed to end."" he told me.  He was crying and I know he is really struggling with my decision to place mom.  He somehow blames himself that mom got dementia - but I reassured him that this is not his fault.  There is just no cure and nothing we can do for mom except to get her good medical care and have her in a safe and protected place with caregivers who understand how to help her 24x7.  I think that up until now dad has been in a sort of denial about mom's situation.  But I have watched as she berates him and also constantly pesters him.  He cannot have a moment's peace when she is around.  Yesterday we bought   barbecue   for lunch and mom wouldn't leave dad alone to eat in peace and he's all of one week post surgical for his colon cancer surgery. He's catheterized and he's struggling to regain his health.   It took myself the caregiver and my husband to get mom off of dad's back so he could eat lunch.  Dad actually asked me if mom could eat with him at the new place - mom is at the point she needs to be fed or directed to eat.  She mostly is trying to give her food to other people - which is annoying to them. I told dad that it is best that mom eats in her area of the facility and he eats in his area.  I told dad that I know he doesn't realize this now but I am rescuing him.  Dad will have an independent living apartment in the same facility as mom.  It is a walk down the hall and an elevator ride for him to get to her.  Luckily the scale of this facility is not so big that it is a daunting prospect.       Dad is scared that mom is going to think that he let her down.     I feel like my father is the victim of emotional abuse by my mother.  My mother would not do this in her right mind but she's not in her right mind.     What I have told dad is that there are many other couples in the same situation that he is who are living in this facility and I'm asking the directors to make sure that dad meets others who have a loved one in AL or Memory Care because he doesn't know anyone else in his situation and also to help provide direction to my dad about how to visit my mom and structure his day to decrease his stress.  Dad is going to be going through physical rehabilitation while there and will have a caregiver for his waking hours to help him with tasks that are too much for him to manage due to his weakness and drive him to appointments and after 6 weeks I'm hiring a personal trainer for him so he can regain his strength and endurance as much as is possible.  Dad's doctor believes he will recover fully and be able to drive again and live well in independent living.  When I told the doctor about my plan he was in total agreement and encouraged my dad to move to the facility.    There is a gym in dad's part of the facility where he can exercise.  I want dad to focus on having a relaxed meal with people who are mentally normal having ""me"" time where he can relax watch TV and even make phone calls without mom constantly interrupting him.  I want dad to have the opportunity to make new friends without mom constantly in tow secure in the knowledge that mom is safe and well cared for.    Still it is so very hard to place my parents.  I hate for dad to have to go through the emotional pain he is dealing with now.  But I truly believe that I am doing what is best for him and best for mom. It's just so very hard.      How can I help my father emotionally through this traumatic situation?  Should I get a counselor for him?  I want to support him all I can and help him to heal physically emotionally mentally and spiritually.    Have others here dealt with this and can you offer me guidance as to what would  best help my father?  I plan to visit him (and my mother)  a lot and moving him near me will allow me to do that and to reunite our family in a way that was impossible with dad and mom living an hour and a half away.",False,MacyRose,2011-12-15,3982.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499533,,,AlzConnected,,,

I had told her they were going to manage her pain she'd been having in her ankle chest. She loves being in hospital. That was Monday. I had dr. appt. hubby's birthday so we didn't go visit her until today Friday. She has transitioned to a different stage. I don't know what to call it but she's there but eyes open mouth open head back shaking hands curled and chest/throat congested. Is this normal in just a few days? She's in the last stage of AD. I feel putting her there may have caused this decline. Maybe she wondered where I was since she doesn't talk on the phone anymore. I called but didn't talk with her. Might have thought I'd placed her.     Monday she was speaking so clearly. Said she wondered what was going on until she saw my hubby ""Now I feel better."" I thought it was strange she was so livid. Talked to the Chaplain about her church where she was from. I did notice her words were really long and extra pronounced. Other days she has been talking sort of baby talk or speaking like she was a little girl in the past. Also just talking as if with someone when nobody was there.     So on the other hand I feel she was headed to the condition I saw today and God didn't want me to see it happen. I would have thought it was something I did wrong. I still feel that way by sending her for respite. Trying to comfort myself. Mom has gone from just being diagnosed in May to what I saw today. So fast. She planned her own birthday party in February. Was calculating her bills and signing checks. I know I'm rambling but this is so fast. She also fell in February.  Hit her head on the floor.   Has fallen several times which we didn't know about.   Do you think this caused such rapid symptoms I'm now seeing?   Maybe she had it all along and we didn't know.

Neurologist placed him on Namenda yesterday and he is set for a full workup including MRI blood work etc. Maybe finally we can get a diagnosis and treatment plan in place.      Here's my first issue:  dad has GUNS lots of them as he was an avid hunter for years.  He has talked about killing himself (many years ago when he was still very healthy) ""if anything is seriously wrong with me.  I don't want to be a burden.""  He has not yet acted out physically but is increasingly verbally abusive to my mom and neighbors as well.  He is ANGRY much of the time.  Mom isn't coping with that very well (naturally) - but I think the way she interacts with him makes him worse not better.       Anyway this is long enough for my first post.  How do I start preparing to cope with what is going to be a very long hard trip??  What steps should I take first and how do I get help for my mom.  Dad is not bad enough to need an in-home caretaker (besides her helping him for now) and he will be adament that he is never going to leave his home.       My head is spinning just from reading these boards and realizing what lies ahead.

We did get hospice care for my Mom which at first I had a hard time accepting that she actually qualified!! But my 2 sisters and I are coming to terms with it and there is a level of peace just knowing these wonderful caring people will be there for our Mom to add extra comfort and support.  i  Immediately they started using Lypoderm (sp?) patches on neck and spine where she was in pain and she is on an oral pain killer that she gets on a consistent basis and this has helped tremendously! They also spend time with her daily (they come to the NH) and provide whatever service they feel is most needed for that day.     It is still so hard watching her decline but at least we feel we are doing everything we can to give her the best possible care. I use to feel very guilty that we were not caring for her at home but I am realizing finally that she has too many needs at this point and she is in the best place for all of her needs.     We don't know if she has a day a month or even a year - some days I really do pray for a heart attack that will take her quickly!

The back surgeon said they will not do any serious back surgery on her or another kyphoplasty.  It is heartbreaking to see her suffer and I am compounding that with guilt and anguish about having decided to let her have the procedure.  I have talked to friends and a counselor who have been helpful but I thought it might help to hear from those who may have had similar experiences.  I have been caring for my dear sweet Mom in my home for six years now - she has a multitude of chronic ailments -- and it is hard to bear the thought that I have contributed to her suffering and decline.  Any shared experiences of or suggestions for alleviating my own suffering so that I can be the best help to my Mom and as functional as I need to be to perform at a demanding full-time job would be appreciated.  Bertha T.,False,BerthaT,2013-08-03,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499424,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am hoping someone can lend your experience and advise on 2 topics.     My mom has been living with my husband and me in South Carolina for 2 months. My brother from Atlanta literally had to get her in NJ and bring her here to ""visit"" as she simply stopped functioning [ADL's] (lost 33lbs) starting about 4 months ago.  It was so sudden of a change I thought perhaps mini-strokes were to blame for the bizarre behavior she started to exhibit. We knew she needed help but she would Refuse to leave NJ. She has a history on that more later.       Now we are at a loss because mom is here and she clearly clearly has some kind of dementia. Big surprise to us. The problem is she doesn't realize it and I don't expect she has the capability  to  realize it. We need her to see a PC doctor as she was also several existing specialists.   So I dealt with her insurance found doctor we both arranged to leave work made the appointment told mom over and over we needed to go. But when it came down to it she flatly refused to go.  Her ""reasons"" are varied but in general she says she cannot find any value in going to a doctor she does not know ""here"" when she is only here to ""visit"". She resents the fact that someone else is making an appointment for her and she feels no need to comply.      We have explained her prior living conditions and her current health conditions in an effort to help her understand we are helping her and acting in her best interested. But she refuses to comply. We ask her questions about what year it is her age etc to Prove to her something is wrong.....Nope. Refuses.     The thing about mom:  We have begged her to move here for Years knowing her living conditions would all crisis one day. Even after 2 strokes (which left her is rather good shape despite by God's grace) she would promise to leave but she would actually never do it. She has years of calling us in desperation needing help for various things but refusing to leave NJ. We have always come to the rescue. Unfortunately she has caused a wake of pain frustration and worry.     In addition you would not believe the corner she has painted herself into that we are trying to literally dig her out of: (months of unpaid bills hoarding house in NJ personal documents lost (buried in hoarding house) health insurance seems to be out of area in SC (yikes) no POA's no Wills.      Medically it is similar: Not remembering medicine enabled diabetes to get out of control which won't allow for cataract surgery (legally blind). Her not complying to see doctors here means she is not getting her PT tests for blood clotting levels that reduces stroke risk in people with atrial fib. Not being diagnosed with dementia will not support guaridanship (even if we could emotionally/financially afford it) nor offer any possible options that can help us all as this progresses. Uhg.      So at the end of all this what we need is your ""Best Practices"" for getting mom to the doctor when she refuses to go.     Our 2nd question is about health insurance ""out of service area"". But before I go on I'd like to share some really Good Stuff going on:      She actually doing much better day to day as we are caring for her (medicines food (gaining back weight) personal company). The desperate calls for help long distance are gone and it is a joy and privilege to see my mom again.        I've been through the Durable POA and Medical POA and somehow she had no issues with her signing them. Notarized too. Thank you Lord.        I have researched in detailed in home care options and have 2 in mind we can use once we find the money. (I think I have a rather comprehensive questionnaire I built for interviewing in home care personal if anyone is interested).        Our jobs are compassionate and allowing us to stay home from work until we have in home care available (we alternate).       God forgives me for the many times I have told him He doesn't care these last 4 months.      Husband came from some village where they eat patience for breakfast lunch and dinner growing up.       The One item I believe logistically is still open is with her medical insurance.      We are told by her PPO Medicare Advantage plan that she is ""out of their service area."" Meaning she will be out of network. (still a Great Plan/Coverage)  But.... the doctor I made the appointment for accepts her plan at In Network costs. ?  Has anyone come across this before?     Also can you simply be out of network indefinitely? I would think on a PPO that is acceptable. I think with HMO's if you are out of the service area for a long period of time the insurance company will terminate your policy. I don't know and depending on who I call I don't have a concrete answer.     Blessings to you all and thanks for listening. Just writing this and reading other posts I feel sooooo much less alone.

1257,6210a74c7b65de9a5b67b178,2147499391,2013-08-03 17:35:00,Do caregivers suffer PTSD when loved one is gone?,"I am beginning to wonder about this. No offense to those who suffered horrific violent crimes or who have served during wartime or any of the many scenarios which cause PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).      But we DO go through a war field of our own when caring for a loved one and watching them fade away inch by inch long before the body succumbs to the disease. It can be a drawn out process and the stress can be unbearable. At least that was my experience.     Let me clarify; my mother died nearly 8 months ago now at age 93 after living with us and Alz for about 4 years. I was sleeping 2 hours a night at best and interrupted sleep at that in a chair by her bed. She did not know my name or our relationship but she was often pleasant and did not ask for much. I loved her still although the Mom I loved had drifted so far away beyond my reach.     Before Mom died my husband went on hospice with CHF and COPD and diabetes and a host of other chronic and terminal conditions. He has defied the odds by still being among us now; his doctors tell me this. Like Mom he asks for very little and is pleasant but it is still so hard living with someone who is dying.     The inner pressure to be nice all the time to be compassionate understanding to handle anything and everything because he cannot or will not help me is draining. My husband also has mild dementia (probably vascular; it is the least of his health issues and we did not pursue extensive diagnosis. Even stopped the Aricept as he was taking 20+ meds which was such a strain on him).     This all leads me to PTSD query as I do feel sort of shell-shocked some days. I try to eat right to exercise (my sanity comes from diving off the deep end of the pool daily) to socialize (although my circle is very small as many of you have experienced) to journal and to pray. I have great support from hospice and a grief counselor and know I am going through anticipatory grief over my husband's condition while dealing with losing my dear mother.     When this caregiver path is done I still have two brothers both younger than me but both in denial about their declining health. One has mental health issues the other physical; neither needs a doctor of course. They know everything or think they do. So maybe my path will continue on and on and on and I wonder how I will ever manage to keep going.     This site was my lifeline while Mom was alive and I have been rather silent lately. It is not that I wish to cut myself off from this valuable resource but it is also very painful to hear others' pain through their posts. My own is still so fresh and is ongoing but pain is always less burdensome when others share it with us.  Wishing blessings to all. Just wanted to pop in here with this topic and did post it on the ""caregivers who lost someone"" part of site as well.      Nora",False,Nora,2012-01-23,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499391,,,AlzConnected,,,

They are due to a reduction of circulation in the skin and muscles and most often occur in the sacral area ( or coccyx) They are different from regular decubitus ulcers in that they form and become very serious quickly and go straight down into tissue and bone rather than spread sideways.        This ulcer is unavoidable and the only treatment is for pain control as the person who develops this usually dies within a short period of time.       If this is your LO be supportive make sure they have enough pain medication and do things for them such as holding a hand stroking their cheek letting them know they are loved.

He thought they were all conspiring against him and he was so out of control that they had to get a male nurse to give him a sedative.  He swung at the nurse in the process.  He finally got some sleep and they put him on Seroquel 12.5 mg with 25 mg as needed at night.    Things calmed down in the hospital the bug hallucinations stopped and he was sleeping through the night.  However I've noticed more pronounced sundowning.  He'll forget where he is fidget with the blankets constantly and become very anxious.  He's Mr. Charming with the hospital staff and difficult with us.    Today he was transferred to the rehab facility...more anxiety and fidgeting.  We finally left when they had him settled in bed for the night.  He thought he was at an airport.  I know they cannot give him the same one on one care attention at the hospital.  This surgery has taken a toll on myself and my family but I know now that we have done everything we can do and now it's up to him to do his part.  The nurse continues to reassure us that it can take up to a week for the anesthesia to get out of his system.  He was never this bad before.    My question is as follows.  Is this accelerated sundowning due to the anesthesia and is this change in behavior permanent or will he return to his pre surgery dementia state.  Also is this sundowning the result of the Seroquel and what kind of additional damage is this doing to him?,False,seepnezorf,2013-06-16,15.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147498671,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is in a memory care facility but it is a long drive from both of my brothers (I am the oldest daughter living on the other side of the country). My brothers are trying their best and they do what they can but both are self-employed and time off is costly for them. I have the luxury of part-time work and can do lots of stuff on the Internet plus frequent flights to visit.     We want to move her to a place with a higher level of nursing care but still lots of stimulation and activity as she is still mobile continent and can engage with others and do some things on her own. Right now she is not in pain not feeling bad at all (or at least not admitting it) and has begun to settle into the routine where she is. She is becoming more resistant to going for doctor dentist eye dr. visits all of which she really needs. We are thinking she needs to be in a place where all of those can be done on site.     How do we talk to her about moving to another place? She has already been in a regular assisted living facility which was not enough structure and stimulation for her. After her hospital stay in May we moved her to memory care in the same facility as the assisted living but it is just too far to drive. As her medical issues become more serious we know we're going to need to get to her quickly sometimes and the whole family would like to be able to come and visit more often.     How do you reason with someone who doesn't think there is anything wrong with her?

This has been her mantra for at least 10 years.      When my dad passed away in 2004 it seemed to get worse instead of just my schedule for when she'd watch my son it was if I called her and said this weekend we're having a party.      That progressively declined to even if she wrote it down she didn't remember. About a year ago I noticed she would ask off the wall questions example ""mom come over for dinner tomorrow at 4"" she would say ok let me write that down is that A.M. or P.M.? Then she said for 2 weeks she has been trying to call my house but it is always busy I said no mom can't be I have call waiting. Finally she said I have your number wrote down right here and she read it to me except it was her phone number that she has had for 38 years. Then she was sending bills out without a check or without a stamp or address. Throwing checks away in the garbage and swearing someone stole them.      We went to a neurologist. She had MRI MRA Sleep Study blood work done.   She has sleep apnea her O2 sats go to 85% during sleep she has 2 small aneurysms she has had a silent stroke and she has frontal lobe shrinkage. Blood work normal. Dr says Mild Alzheimers and did not give her any medications. This was June 27 2013.    In the last month she has gone from just being forgetful to absolutely down right scary. She tells a story and places herself in the story when she wasn't there. She has forgotten my name. She takes her meds for hypertension turns around and then says OH I HAVEN'T TAKEN MY MEDS!! She doesn't recall memories from long ago she didn't know a picture of my dad when he was younger she doesn't remember short term at all. She was in the hospital and the dr came in and asked her why she was there (she was having headaches jaw pain neck pain left side) and she said I don't know I feel fine. He asked her medical history she didn't know it. When we answer for her and say hypertension she says ""I DO?"" She doesn't remember surgeries she's had. The Hospital Dr says she needs to be on meds and that she is NOT mild but has had this for many many years. (BTW she had TMJ causing the pain) I tell her on a daily basis what she has and she asks me if she'll get better and that she's trying really hard to fight it and get better. She really hasn't been sick her entire life. She has never acted her age she was still clubbing it at 70 dancing with the 20 something year olds. When she was sick with flu or cold she never stayed in bed always kept on going.   Now she is napping in the day not wanting to do or go anywhere. She had a drivers evaluation and they say she is a safe driver but can't go to new places only familiar areas. we live in a very small town in the country she doesn't go but 4 miles.   Do I insist that the dr give her meds? She is so fed up with Dr's she doesn't think anything is wrong with her. She won't go back for the sleep study to get fitted with Cpack thing she says the Dr's are lying. I have took over paying her bills online but she now accuses me of money missing. I do not have access to her money I can't take money out or write checks just pay the bills.

Monday morning they found a slight UTI so started treating with antibiotics.  When I went to visit in the afternoon she was awake but very delirious and extremely weak.  Thought she was driving a car but couldn""t reach the pedals told crazy stories etc.  Got there this morning (Tuesday) and she was even worse.  Complained of neck pain and delirious stories again when I could hear her  her voice is very weak.  Soon fell so sound asleep for 5 hours through a cat scan EEG blood draw X-ray etc.  Could shout her awake but she'd only waken for a few seconds.  Woke her enough to feed her some dinner but was barely there.

She turned evil I hate to say  .    And here I am alone not knowing what to do.  I don't think moms memory is messed up but then I don't know.  I think it has decreased..It's hard to accept it not sure.  She is so quiet now.  All she does is say yes or no and constantly making body movements.  She has OCD to the max.  Her dentures in and out and restless ...However she likes to walk ... She smiles at people.  She is responsive but not talkative.  I don't know whats wrong .. I think its depression.  It hit her hard.       I used to be depressed with no desire to talk in earlier stages of my life  Let me know what I can do to make things better.  I am taking mom to the doc next week but also I think I need to take her to a home maybe 5-6 people ..    I am not trustworthy from previous experiences I am afraid she will be mistreated.  I don't know what to do.  Her old house is abandoned.. I have not gone back because its full of criminals (the neighborhood) including the neighbor who  caused so many problems. She needs to be sued I think     But that is not important right now.  What is important is that mom gets better.  I hope she starts talking again or I have to accept things for what they are..    Maybe new faces will help her.  Maybe I need to meet new people. I need therapy ..  I have zero support and the pain of losing those who you thought liked you instead loathe you for money.  That is pathetic but the truth.    In the end of the day I feel bad cause I got no one just God and her.  I hope I find good people out there.  I only tried my best.  I am very discouraged.  Thanks for any support.

I was amazed due to my heart that I whizzed thru the prep brush shave shower and dress without going into angina (heart pains).      I arrived at my wife's side and she was pleased to see me. But like always my wife could only mumble rather than speak. Part way thru our visit while sitting on a couch I had an employee Caregiver offer a blanket to me to place upon what I thought was my chilly wife. I spread the blanket around the shoulders and torso of my now groggy wife however in my wife's muddled mind she reached over in a sharing move to place some of the blanket upon me. But my early morning arising was now caching up with me as I was going into coma type of mini naps; I know when I am asleep as some form of tiny nightmare passes thru my mind causing me to return to a conscious state of mind and continue passing my hand over my wife's cheeks or her neck or somewhere that she can feel my touch and attention  hopefully transmitting some kind of affectionate attention.      Within minutes my wife fell into a weary sleep still holding onto my hand under the blanket. After a lengthy chosen time I kissed my wife and thanked her for letting me visit. (Kind of a softening ""fib"" to ease my departure.)      The blanket moves were such a small gesture but a strong reflection of who we my wife and I are. Husband and wife.  When I returned home I went to bed and slept for 3 hours. But it haunts me even now many hours later that I had to leave my wife behind. When does the pain stop?     Thanks for reading my vent this far.

His doctor said he can't have surgery because he wouldn't survive it his heart is too weak and its to advanced he can only drink liquids.  Today is Saturday June 8 and my dad was transferred to a nursing home which he didn't like one bit. I his daughter do not like it either nor does my mom and sister he looked sad and he just got angry and started cursing and yelling and getting hard to control and I could see the pain in my mom's eyes since she has been his 24/7 caregiver and she has been doing such a great job herself along with us siblings when we can. He was given a pill to calm him down which worked great I just don't like him being there at all he is just supposed to be there til Tuesday then he gets to go home my dad is 82 and if it wasn't for his Alzheimer's or this cancer he is pretty healthy but they gave my dad only 6 months which is hard to grasp.

1272,6210aac77b65de9a5b67beb2,2147498520,2013-06-26 23:16:00,Newbie(2),Howdy! I am new to this whole disaster living the Alzheimer's life with my 93 year old dad. He had part of one foot amputated about 5 years ago and the continued pain does not help his labile mood. Just got his diagnosis 3 weeks ago and although he was diagnosed with early stage he is steadily going down the ramp. I am newly retired after 20 years working as a Music Therapist serving the Forensic and Chronic populations in a State Mental Hospital which had me totally burned out.   Daddy refuses to leave his apartment to live with me and also refuses assisted living situations adult day care senior center activities and friendly visiter programs. He has one friend who picks him up on Fridays and takes him to a fishing supply store where he puts labels on merchandise and the guys there buy him lunch. This outing is the highlight of his week. Due to his leg pain he refuses all other outings except doc appointments.  My home is 50 miles away and I have been spending 4-5 days a week living with him. The commute through L.A. is killing me and even though I love sleeping in my own bed I sometimes feel the stress of the traffic is not worth going home for. Also when I go back to my place daddy calls me so much that I get all cranked up and cannot relax well.  I do not have any other relatives willing to help with his care and am the Medical and Legal POA for him.   Daddy is very verbally abusive and threatening at times. His remarks are often illogical and he derails easily. I try to put my feelings aside and pretend he is one of my patients but I have no office to retreat to when he follows me around the apartment yelling at me. The other day he came upon me nose to nose yelling and I told him I was not going to participate in a conversation with him yelling. I asked him to move away from me and he refused 5 times till he finally moved.  Even though he is not paying bills on time he insists on doing his own paperwork. When he asks for help with this then he yells when I give an answer. I am hesitant to say a word because I do not want to rock the boat. He screamed at me last night because I work a crossword puzzle while he reads the paper because I am not paying attention to him. If I try to wash dishes or be considerate he tells me not to and yet if I leave him to do his own thing he screams that I don't consider him.  I try to swim everyday at the same time and also leave for 1-2 hours to run errands or just walk somewhere nice.   I hate having to read the 36 hour book after being so burned out from all the years working in Mental Health.   Hope to make friends with you and to hear your experiences.

If you are able to handle the Loved One at home no need to read further. But if the Loved One is that loving extreme difficulty let me help you a bit.     ~     My wife has been in 3 Care Facilities. Two of them did not work out well. With the latter she has been a Alzheimer Resident for 3 and one half years. I am most please with where my wife is at. (Keep reading). My wife's Care Facility is not the plush Facility with an abundance of employee Caregivers or all-day snack bars. But also I (ah em! ""We"") are able to ""Private Pay for at least another 5 years. Then I anticipate fate will have made a decision for us.     ~     But back to my member-readers. I have seen new patients come and go in my wife's Facility. Some have departed via Hospice.  I extend myself to all patients and Next of Kin. Some visiting Kin think I am a boob but others welcome the ""inside"" experience of a new friend.  Patients often do not know how to accept me as all arrive a little lost a few arrive really lost. But as time passes and with the excellent application of ""New patient attention"" the new resident ultimately folds into being a patient that accepts their channeled but excellent life style. Many ask for a long time just as my wife did that they pressure into tears the visiting Next of Kin ""Please take me Home."" But this is where the Next of Kin must also put themselves thru their own painful training of accepting the pleadings of the Loved One. It will happen so prepare.   ~     I highly expect the worst family type pain I ever endured was when my wife was crying extremely loudly being held back by two employee Caregivers and I was frozen in my departing footsteps. It took the wise commands of an employee Caregiver to tell me twice ""Go Ken"". I still was frozen then again ""Go Ken."" I finally realized I had a job to do no matter how painful. I could not handle my wife at home and having my wife among experienced Caregivers was not only my choice but the better of any choices.  ~     Today my wife has progressed into not being able to speak. When I visit we cuddle a bit she mumbles then she drifts away mentally but I understand. My wife has Alzheimer. I have lost the wife I had but she is in the best comfort zone possible. I am pleased to the point where I am sometimes numb of emotion because it would seem I as the husband should not accept my wife being held in restricted living. However of the many choices available and their were only two; live at home with me and one of us would destruct or have my wife where she is living with moment to moment comfort in the care of people who know how to handle Demented patients.      ~     I realized approx. 6 months ago I was growing a little numb with my feelings ""taking back"" a little time for myself rather than visiting my wife 7/7. It is like I can ""see"" my feelings but can not feel them. I realized 7/7 visits per week was the valiant thing to do but I also have a little problem; I am a serious heart patient. My wife is 88 and I am 84.      ~     My move to place my wife was by far the smartest kindest soundest move I have ever made in my life.

We have two sticking points however.  I say NO ANTIBIOTICS even for UTI.  My thinking from talking to all my nurse friends is a UTI won't kill her but she could become septic and that will take her.  The doctor agrees with me he could tell I did my research.   Also hydration.  My brother thinks dehydration a horrible way to die but if my mother stopped drinking or couldn't drink I'm all for CARE AND COMFORT MEASURES ONLY at that point.  My brother keeps saying ""they only give morphine for pain"".  But the doctor said if we asked for ""care and comfort measures only"" then morphine would be given.  I've asked my brother to talk to the doctor again on Monday to make sure he understands this.  He thinks if my mother no longer drinks they won't give her morphine but my understanding from the doc on Friday was that they WOULD give her morphine at that point.        Also from talking to my five nurse friends who have seen A LOT over the 50+ years of experience they have dehydration is not the most horrible way to die because they make sure they are in no pain mental or physical ergo MORPHINE.   My brother keeps saying it's a horrible way to die not sure how he would know maybe it's an assumption.          This all comes down because he is the healthcare proxy so he will listen to things I have to say but the decision is his.  I said to him ""so if she stopped eating you'd let her starve but if she stopped drinking you'd stick a needle in her arm"".  Crikey we could keep her hydrated for TEN YEARS; again NOT what my mother wants.

Some oils are used individually while there are blends formulated to support specific needs such as relaxation during the waking hours anxiety mind stimulation sleep support and appetite stimulation. The task of taking care of people who suffer from these diseases is very challenging and aromatherapy has also shown to be helpful for caregivers and family members.                 Jackie Farnell owner of Scentsible Solutions created aromatherapy blends and protocols for Alzheimer’s patients that are used in more than 450 nursing facilities. Studies with these blends showed overall improvement in the quality of life of patients reduction in medications and improved attendance of caregivers.           One of Farnell’s blends Restore Peace which contains frankincense and grapefruit was used for a woman who screamed nonstop unless she was asleep. After one week of use her screaming decreased by 50 percent and completely subsided by the end of week two. The patient was eventually taken off her anti-psychotic medication and was able to move out of the dementia unit.           Donna Whyte-English owner of Holistic Aromatics relates how one patient became mean while being bathed dressed or redirected but with inhalation of lemon balm essential oil there was an immediate mood change to one of peacefulness and cooperation. Another patient found this same aroma intolerable but loved those of orange lemon frankincense vetiver and may chang and when inhaling them was no longer combative.           Clove bay laurel cinnamon leaf rosemary lemon balm nutmeg frankincense and basil are some of the essential oils that improve cognition. If agitation becomes a problem you could use these essential oils: lavender rose orange patchouli Ylang Ylang or lemon balm.           Other aspects of Alzheimer’s patient care that have been successfully addressed with essential oils include memory enhancement pain and constipation relief infection control (via reduced transmission/prevention of bacterial and viral illnesses) wound care (including MRSA) palliative care and stress reduction and enhanced well-being of residents facility staff and home caregivers.              http://www.thaiodysseyblog.com/the-wonders-of-essential-oils-for-alzheimers-patients/,False,Myriam,2011-12-06,3326.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147497440,,,AlzConnected,,,

We had to leave by 5:00pm.  My mom came downstairs after taking over 2 hours to get dressed she always take 2-3hrs to get ready to go out someplace and that's without having to get a shower.  That is a half day wait.  I understand it just takes her longer and I check on her throughout the ""process.""  When she came downstairs she asked what time we had to leave.  I told her 5:00pm.  It was 3:45 then.  So I asked her if she had the graduation card.  She said oh I hope I didn't throw it away!  I assured that she hadn't that it was probably in either the dining room or living room the 2 rooms she spends the most time in.  She did finally find it. and came out to the kitchen with it asking me now what do I do with this?  I told her to go ahead and sign it and I would put it in the envelope for her.  She asked what do I write?  I said just put Love Mom. She asked that's it?!  So I suggested 4 or 5 additional phrases that she could choose from.  She wrote inside the card for a bit then gave it to me.  When I glanced inside I saw that she had written all the phrases I had suggested.  I was actually impressed that she remembered      So I put the card in the envelope and gave it back to her and told her to go ahead and put my sister's name on it.  She asked what do I write?  I gave her my sister's nickname and she said oh shouldn't I put Margaret Susan?  I said of course you can put whatever name you like.  So she wrote her name on the envelope. Then she said oh do you have a stamp?  Because it says we need extra postage.  I said no you don't need a stamp because you're going to give it to her tonight right?  She said yes.      I suggested she bring her nintendo handheld game with her she said I don't have a nintendo!  I said yes you do you've playing games on that for years!  And she said well that won't fit in my purse!  I think she was thinking of the big game system     I went and found it and said this one - it'll fit in your purse.  And she said oh I'm not bringing that all the drunks will get it and wreck it!  I laughed a bit she was so funny.  I told her she shouldn't worry about that we were going to a graduation not to a bar - not that we EVER go to bars so I really don't know what she was thinking.  And all kinds of comments questions until it was time to leave they were all so funny my husband and I found ourselves laughing.  She was really comical.  At one point she insisted that we were going to my sister's birthday.  Then she corrected herself and said oh that's right her birthday is tomorrow.  I said well her birthday is June 21st.  My mom asked well what's today?  I said May 22nd.  And she gave me a blank look.  I told her not to worry I would remind of her birthdays so that we had cards.    But when we left the graduation with all the people walking to their cars outside I think my mom was panicking.  She could barely put one foot in front of her with my sister on one side holding her arm me on the other side and my husband in front trying to clear a path for her.  She just had a very very difficult time.    Yesterday I was home in the afternoon with her and don't you know it happened.  She fell down the last 2 steps coming from upstairs.  I ran out to her she was lying flat out on the floor half in the dining room and half on the floor at the bottom of the steps.  I asked her if she was ok she said yes but she was kind of sobbing out loud.  She hurt her knee again and was so upset that she had fallen.  I helped her up as best I could and got her to her recliner and put her feet up.  Then I tried to check out her ankles her knees elbows shoulders head. She seemed fine just her knees hurt from landing on them.  Luckily a physical therapist was coming for her first visit from the dr's visit last Friday when I took my mom because her knee was really hurting.  Everything seemed ok just tender and pain in the surrounding area.  So he scheduled a physical therapist to come to the house and check her out.  (He also told her NO MORE DRIVING.  The therapist checked her out carefully and she seemed ok.      After talking to my mom for a bit and glancing over at me at some of the answers I heard her ask my mom what year is it?  Can you tell me what year it is?  And my mom responded 2000!  No 2011!  Wait 2013.  Then she asked my mom to count backwards from 20.  My mom missed 4 numbers in that sequence.  Finally she asked her to tell her the months beginning with December and ending with January. My mom didn't understand at first but finally figured it out.  And she said December November October September.............. 10 9 8 6 5 4 2 1!  Truthfully are those mistakes a huge concern or just mistakes?      The therapist also noticed that my mom falls to her right leans to her right and trips over her feet quite often.  She's going to work with her to lift her feet off the floor more she shuffles.  When the therapist came today she asked how my mom was doing and I told her that she had as usual pretty much been in her recliner - after having breakfast - watching tv and napping.  In fact she was napping then.  She told me that she's going to recommend an occupational therapist come to see my mom.  I'm not sure what they will do?   The therapist also talked to my mom about her medications.  My mom takes a LOT of pills 4 times a day and she can't keep them straight and I can't get a straight answer or complete information from her to organize them for her.  I am at a loss who to turn to to get this in order for her.  I'm thinking maybe our pharmacist?  My mom takes Nexium and a nurse who came to the house last November when she had pneumonia told her to take that one separate from her other pills like a half hour after.  My mom interpreted that as keeping the pill physically separate from the others and so keeps them in their own separate containers.  I was surprised to find out that that's what she thought the nurse meant.   I'm so worried I beginning to feel paralyzed and don't quite know which way who to talk to next.  We do have an appt at a memory care center for an evaluation in about 10 days it just can't seem soon enough.  I just don't want anything else to happen to her :/    Thanks for letting me get all this out and I am open to any and all advice      Terry",False,TerryD59,2012-07-11,93.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147497746,,,AlzConnected,,,

They concluded she pulled a muscle.  Well 4 days later she started getting very very lethargic a day or two later she was in a stupor most of the time was completly confused and acting very odd. Met w docs they ordered a bunch of tests but told me they suspected a UTI and they were right. We also found out they had changed her meds a little bit and we reset them back the way they were prior to hospital. After a day or two she stopped acting weird but was still sleepy and in a lot of pain. Finally got her on the right antibiotic last night after culture came back and she seemed more alert today with color in her phase but she is still having chest pain and is anxious at times. Tonight she refused to let the aides help her to the toilet accusing them of hurting her. Finally got a nurse she trusts who was able to get her on and off the toilet.  This was quite upsetting because it reminded me of what she used to do last year when she was having episodes at the old nursing home. The only difference is last year it was a lot worse she'd hit and scratch them- she was also on difference meds.     Yikes.

1289,6210aec77b65de9a5b67cdb6,2147497084,2013-04-24 09:22:00,Causes of sleep problems (waking too often or sleeping too much),"Hi       As a geriatric nurse and with lots of dementia care experience I have to say that the best situation for people with dementia is an established routine for sleep.   This should be possible until about mid to late stage 6.       Older people actually need a little less sleep than younger folks. Yet often I see posts where they are put to bed at 6 or 7 often with meds to help them sleep through. Then they get up late and are sleepy all day.       I'd like to pick this apart.       7 to 8 hours sleep is plenty. Older people get up often at night for a variety of reasons including needing to use the bathroom heart palpitations arthritic and muscle pains etc. This is completely normal. Unfortunately when they get up they often wander around and families would rather they sleep all night. Often sleep meds are sought.       Older people do not absorb metabolize or excrete medications as well as they did when they were younger. So the meds may stay in their systems longer. This may be one reason they are sleepy during the day.       Lets look at other reasons people with dementia get sleepy during the day. The number one cause is boredom. Everyone needs stimulation activity socialization and some reason to ""get up in the morning"". Something to look forward to.Without this they sit a lot. Systems slow down. Circulation slows and the metabolism slows. Sleepiness and fatigue follow.       The second cause is depression. It often goes hand in hand with boredom. There is little fun in life any more. Each day the person loses more memory and cognition and may be at the point where their physical abilities are being affected. Depression is the most under-diagnosed condition in the elderly especially those with dementia.       Another reason for not getting up or moving around much during the day may be arthritic or muscle pain. The person with dementia may not be able to communicate this. Even minor aches and pains can interrupt sleep interfere with daily activities and add to causes of depression.       Any caregiver considering sleeping meds or faced with someone who is sleeping too much needs to be aware of these problems.  Caregivers should try to figure out exactly what the problem is before giving meds that can increase confusion and cause sleepiness during the day.   Hope this helps.    Stephanie",False,Stephanie Z,2011-12-15,4217.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147497084,,,AlzConnected,,,

Other medical issues include heart problems (leaky mitral valve moderate heart failure atrial fibrillation) and osteoarthritis. She lives in an independent-living senior residence where meals and activities are provided but no medical care or medicine management is available. I set out her daily heart medicines once weekly and she takes them on her own with occasional mix-ups.   The osteoarthritis causes significant shoulder pain. She has a vicodin prescription set up for as-needed and takes around 4/day. The prescription allows for up to 8/day. She tries to keep track of her vicodin use by writing down the time she takes one but often forgets. She seems to be in pain a lot of the time. I don't know if this is because the vicodin isn't working she needs to take more or if she waits too long between pills. Her memory and cognitive problems make it impossible for her to take them at regular intervals. Her PC offered a prescription to the BuTrans 10 mcg weekly patch cautioning that it's stronger than vicodin and could cause her heart to slow down.   I like the idea of a patch but have some concerns. There's a long list of possible side-effects. It can cause abnormal heart rhythm so people with atrial fibrillation and heart failure are given extra cautions. I'm not sure how safe this patch would be for her in an independent living situation. At some point it may be necessary for her to move to an ALF where they could give her pain medicine at regular intervals but she prefers to stay where she is at least for now.  My questions:  1.

On Sunday morning he confided to my husband that he was experiencing diarrhea. Let me say that I am actually happy he even said something to him because normally he does not say anything about pain or discomfort.     We have had to learn how to ""read him"" to determine if he is anxious or is experiencing any pain and have become extremely adept at figuring out when something is wrong.     So aside from the diarrhea there was nothing else noticeable that was different. Sunday night he got out of bed every hour nearly on the hour to go to the restroom. I know he had a horrible night of sleep and with Sun Downer's I was worried he would be grumpy yesterday.     He drank his breakfast yesterday morning and I managed to get him to drink just 8 ounces of water before lunch. Lunch went well and he had complete his lunch and were we sitting in the living room watching some tv I was finishing up my sandwich and saw that Gramps was taking a sip of some lemonade I had given him with his meal.     He began choking and could not keep anything down. His meal had been digested for about 10-15 minutes so it was just a lot of liquid that was coming up. I made sure he was okay and then helped him to the bathroom and gave him time to clean up (he tends to be private when it comes to bathroom issues of any sort) and then clean the area he had his meal so he did not have to walk back into the room and have a visual reminder that would cause him to be embarrassed about the incident.     Something . . . just a nagging feeling because of the diarrhea the day before a cough he has had for about a week complaints of freezing the night before when the air was not on in the house (he also has a heater in his room that is temp. controlled and we can set it remotely as well so it is not too humid in his room) and again just a feeling I had I called his Geriatrician. It was 4pm at this time and the office closes at 5pm so I was more concerned that waiting a day might be a bad thing and wanted to know if the doctor wanted us to go to the hospital instead. He did.     Last night I think I was there for about 3 hours before talking to the doctor. During the time he has been either our neighbor 8 eight houses down or living with us since we are his primary care giver's I have never been worried or concerned except twice. Both of those times were last night.     The first was when the ER doctor felt his abdomen area and her eyes became very wide. She kept moving around and asking questions to him about pain and then said that in addition to a chest x-ray (to rule out pneumonia) they wanted to preform an abdominal ct scan.     When the admitting doctor returns whom he saw just 3 months ago in the same ER came to explain the results he told us that there was no pneumonia. That was the only good news.     He was also diagnosed with a kidney stone that the doctor described as ""extremely large"" and is blocking his ureter. In addition he was diagnosed with Diverticulitis. They kept him in the hospital and said it would be more than likely a two night stay.     The doctor then asked me if he had a living will and any DNR orders. This was the second time I was worried because I know they don't ask that unless they know it is something more than what ""7-10 days of antibiotics can clear up"" and a visit from a Urologist to check out the kidney stone requires.     The Urologist has not yet visited him. They are monitoring his fluids and trying to make sure the bacteria in his intestines responds to the antibiotics.     Okay I am in NO WAY in denial about his condition. I know he is in late stage 6 Dementia and because when we visited today we did not see a doctor at any time to update us (yes we have Healthcare Power of Attorney Durable Power of Attorney and any other necessary legal document to make decisions for him) my husband is listed as the primary contact and is his grandfathers primary agent and I am listed second.      My mother in law thinks he is going to be fine and said in the ER last night that he has lived with Diverticulitis for years to which the doctor told her she was wrong because it is just a bacterial infection and is not a permanent condition. Tonight she is still insisting the doctor is wrong and we keep rolling our eyes at her inability to learn! She is complaining about the kidney stone and livid they have not seen him for that.     My husband and I keep telling her we are not worried because the kidney stone is the lesser issue and that the Diverticulitis is the most serious concern the doctors have and that we have as well. We know that at 90 he would refuse surgery and even if he agreed to it the recovery from such a surgery (my grandmother had 2 feet of her intestines removed due to chronic Diverticulitis about 20-25 years ago so even a healthy adult has a difficult recovery time) could be too much for him.     I have a horrible feeling that the doctors are not free with information because they don't want to alarm us that we may be looking at the possibility that he is experiencing possible organ failure due to the spread of the bacteria. Today he was being given Potassium when my husband was there because his levels were extremely low.     As realists my husband and I want to be able to prepare any final arrangements for his grandfather if it is that time and to be able to advocate for him his medical wishes and make sure that if he has a limited amount of time left with us that he is comfortable and pain management is a priority.     I am visiting the hospital in the morning and would like to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how to approach the subject with the doctor that if we are looking at a more serious issue to let us know so we can determine a palliative care plan for him.      Thank you for taking the time to read my long message and thank you in advance to those who can offer their own experiences if they were in similar situations.",False,TheWarden,2013-03-03,68.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147497233,,,AlzConnected,,,

I proposed I could try for a time on Wed though couldn't guarantee or could do other days.      It's now after 10am the day before the proposed mtg not heard back yet. She might be sick or swamped or something Or perhaps she's decided that since my Wed is iffy they will go ahead without me? Can they do that?  My mom is still fairly with it enough to speak for herself though her short term memory is bad so maybe they feel that they don't have to go out of their way to get me there or have me on a conference call?  The only other thing I can think of is that mom had to spend Sat night in the hospital for outpatient observation because of pain in her breasts. They ruled out a heart problem and concluded it was muscle strain. She came home Sunday and is doing fine. Just seems a little rude if they aren't going to change the time  to not at least acknowldege my call and email.      There's a little precedent for the last minute thing too.  For mom's last care mtg the social worker called me the day before she wanted to have the meeting. Now I wasn't working at the time so it was fine with me. Now the situation is different.     I'd love to hear your experiences with these conferences. How much advance notice did you get?  Were they willing to change the date if there was a conflict or did they give you a choice?  Just seems kind of inflexible to me but perhaps I'm not understanding their situation.  Mom doesn't have anything urgent to address but I'm still a little puzzled by the lack of communication and not much advance notice.

I never know what my wife is thinking as she cannot speak but her rambling mumbles were full of tones of happiness never seemingly to cease.      When seating for lunch was being done I sat my wife at her dining table. I generally dread having to tell my wife I am departing as this is when my wife will try to arise and travel out the exit with me on her very feeble legs. The previous visit my wife turned white in the face and cried and ""mouthed"" the words ""why"". But with this Saturday visit it was like she was her old self seeing me off to the grocery store.     What added to the pleasing scenario was that a bag of a new patient whom had given me a tremendously bad time as I was assisting an employee Caregiver several days before was sitting right next to my wife. This patient in perhaps her 3rd month had yet to join with any patient; choosing to be a recluse among the patients. But on this day of my wife's giddiness the crabby patient was watching my wife intently also seeing me cater to my wifes feelings. The baggy patient even smiled and I saw the wonderment on the patient's face. I told the recluse that my wife does not speak which put the big piece of how the puzzle works in Alzheimer care into the thoughts of the now pleased ex-recluse patient. I cannot eat with my wife as she gets fussy at the dining table with me there.     As I walked out the building exit I told myself that this day is the best day I have had since my wife went into Alzheimer approx 10 years previous. And for once I really belieived that I had placed my wife where she can receive the best attention that both of us feel is a comfort and aid to her.      As an added note I stepped into the Facility kitchen to say hello to my friend the female cook. I suspect I am the only visiting Next of Kin who ever steps into the kitchen. I try hard to let Staff know I care for my wife and I care for them.      Ten years. A long time. I never thought I would see the day. This day was not a goal or an expectation but rather unexpected vindication of all the guilt and pain my wife and I have felt for all the years.      I think my post here is called a vent.

Recently actually not even a week ago I moved her from the locked down secured unit in the rehab to a very lovely ALF.  She is living among the general population in a studio apartment.  She finally ""earned"" ""done her time"" to receive her medicaid wavier.  The room is paid in part by the medicaid waiver semi-monthly rate her social security and I pay private pay to afford the private room for her.       She was wanting a coffee pot so I brought her one.  It's one of the new ones that automatically shuts off after 2 hours.  I was curious to see if she could make a pot of coffee because the last time she was making coffee it had become quite an ordeal.  It was probably October/November of last year. She would have coffee grounds in the clear water area and overflowing messes.  She has actually made a couple pots since I brought it in and it appears she's doing it the right way!!           Also she's using a note book to record anyone coming in to see her.  She wants them to write their name down &amp; why they are seeing her. This way even if she forgets she can look at her note book as a reminder.  And She thought of that one.  She seems to be returning to her former mental state prior to her downhill decline in the fall of last year.            As you know she is on aricept numenda seroquel and zyprexa. I find this quite amazing that it's getting better rather than the opposite.  She does not venture out of her room much.  I would love for her to get out &amp; about more to have some social interaction. I think in time she will.             She is also learning to go to the med station for her medication.             I just cannot believe this turnaround.  I am wondering what the heck she has.  I know her short term memory is just about blown but then again she can remember if they change her medications if she goes somewhere like today she had a manicure.  My sister is going to be a grandma any day now and Mom asks her every time she sees her if her daughter has had the baby.             I cannot figure this out. Maybe it's only dementia she has?  Although she has had bad bouts of sun downing and no longer does.  She used to have bad hallucinations but not anymore.  She does complain about back pain...but with all the xrays &amp; test they took it showed she has arthritis in her back.         So I wanted to ask if anyone else has experience this phenomenon?  Or ever heard of this happening?  It's just so odd &amp; strange to have her ""coming back"" mentally speaking.   .     Looking forward to your posts!

1298,6210b0e07b65de9a5b67d5b2,2147496648,2013-04-06 09:38:00,Searching for the right doctor,Hello everyone  This is my first time here and my search for information is what brought me to this website. My mother has not been diagnosised with anything and there lies the problem. She lives in a small town near Tallahassee and I am searching for a doctor that I can take her to in an attempt to get a diagnosis.  About 5 years ago she developed this headache at the base of her skull by the ocsiptal bone. Right about the same time she started having memory issues. She gets confused easily and repeats herself this has stayed with her and has gotten worse over time. My mother was always the person that could remember names and dates of years gone by. She never forgot anything!  An ENT told her that there was fluid in the mastoid bone and he proceeded putting her through a couple of surgeries to correct her sinuses the headache remained but her sinus issues have all be resolved. When she gets upset it hurts more she is easily flustered and has to go at her own speed. She will not listen to any discussion about dementia alzheimer etc. She is terrified and gets real angry.   Her father had some form of dementia but was never diagnosed. My grandmother took care of him until he died but it got to the point where he didnt know anyone and he would try to get out of the house at night. So I fear there is a genetic issue here.  The ENT referred her to a neurologist in Tallahassee after he was through with her and they did an MRI put her through a couple of memory tests and said it was old age. Put her on neurotin for the headache which did not work and she never went back. He also referred her to a pain management doctor who did steriod shots in the back of her head but it didnt give her any relief.  Her primary doctor referred her to a physical therapist for the pain in the head which she says one day he got right on that pain and as bad as it hurt he was able to move the pain a bit to ease it but it came back after the treatments ended.  So I have an appointment with her primary doctor when I go to visit in an effort to find the right doctor who can rule out if the pain is causing the memory issues or if they are two separate issues that just happened to start around the same time.  I will say that she has a friend that visits her everyday that helps keep her straight. I know that she is paying her bills on time and she doesnt get lost but places that she used to be able to go by herself seem to overwhelm her now and she has grown very dependent on her friend. Basically when this person is no longer available the decision will need to be made if she moves to Texas or I move to Florida.  I live in Texas and talk to her many times per week and do my best to help from afar. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to find a doctor that can help us. I thought the neurologist was the doctor who would guide us but it didnt turn out that way.,False,LT2013,2013-04-06,23.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147496648,,,AlzConnected,,,
1299,6210b0ee7b65de9a5b67d5eb,2147496665,2013-04-07 11:17:00,Suddenly stops eating,I   have not been on here for  quite  awhile. To be honest it was not serving my purpose at the time. And I was spending too much time on the computer.    I also got tired of my posts disappearing right when I was in the middle. Still can't get the bold print to stay on.      Anyway my question is: Has anyone had the experience of having someone stopping to eat overnight? My husband has. He has not eaten anything solid since Mar. 4.      For those not familiar with us my husband is 96 and has had AD for over 10 yrs. I am 66 and we have been  married 40 yrs.      I had a total knee replacement in Feb. I also badly tore the miniscus in the other knee 3 weeks before the knee replacement. I put my husband in the re-hab facility I was in for three weeks under Respite Care so we could be together. He was eating all his meals.I came home on a Fri. and had him come home Mon. so I could get adjusted at home. When I fixed supper that night he would not eat asnd it has been that way since. I don't know what may have happened the 2 days I wasn't there.     I have aids coming in  from 9 AM to 10:30 PM. to take care of him. I am not able to at this time. The visiting physician came in last week gave husband quick go over and said he was in end stage AD. When I asked about something to stimulate the appetitie his replied you want to prolong this. I did not like his attitude. Besides the nurse from the Home health agency noticed husbands tongue was whitish and said he could possibly have oral trush. He had been on antibiotics for UTI. Doctor said probably from dehydration. Hubby makes a face when he goes to swallow and says his throat hurts. I have had a hard time getting the nurse practioner to come out to see him. She is finally coming Tues.      Hubby also keeps complaning of pain in his private area and I am wondering if he could still have a UTI. He seems to swallow ok just makes a face adn if I ask says it hurts. Also says things don't taste good.      I can accept the fact if it is end stage although watching someone not eat is the hardest. But there are other things that could be contributing to his symptoms.   He stil loves to play Bingo and a card game we have played for some time.      I am just curious if anyone has had the experience of someone to stop eating almost overnight? I was under the impression it happened more gradually.,False,Fluffy,2011-12-05,126.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147496665,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have stopped going to my support groups as well.     My mom is 78 w/ALZ diagnosed almost 3 years. She has been the primary caregiver to my dad who is in a wheelchair.     I live with them.  Mom complained of knee pain back in Feb. and was given two injections which seemed to help.  During that time she refused to get out of bed. She reported her knee hurt and it was too cold.     She would get my dad out of bed and she would go back to bed. She would make my dad something to eat with my dad directing her but not everyday.     Mom got shingles on 3/22/13 very painful. It's hard to determine how much pain because one minute she is ok the next minutue she is in a extreme amount of pain.     I was giving her prescribed Norcos every 4 hours for about two days then I realized she was not eating as much sleeping all the time and became very shakey.     I don't want her in pain. My dad was in charge of giving her pain medication during the week and on the weekends I watch it.      Since 3/22/13 she does not get out of bed only to get my dad in and out of bed.  She still eats small amounts. Will only eat in bed.     I am having many firsts with my mom.     REFUSES to shower. REFUSED going to her doctors appointment.   I mean refuses she cries whines says I am mean and has a tantrum like a child.     Up until now she would change my dad but now she won't. We just recently starting to have someone come out once a week to bathe my dad     I work full time.      I placed a call into her neurologist to hopefully get an evaluation for some home health care. Or even if she qualifies for hospice.     Parents aren't considered low income. They do have medicare with a private insurance. No long term insurance.      I want them home as long as possible.     I am a ball of stress and my patiences are at all time low when it comes to MY children and spouse.

She is probably between a stage 5/6. I knew this day would come so I had been touring facilities that would provide great care and  would eventually transition her from private pay to Medicaid within 18 months as that's when Mom's funds will be depleted.     I found a 4-5 star NH facility with an ALZ section that I placed Mom in and during the care plan meeting carefully went over specific issues - including the fact that Mom is a Fall Hazard and needed her walker to safely walk due to a previous broken hip/replacement and apraxia of (gait). All of this was documented by the head of nursing. admin. Yet during my subsequent visits - I never saw my Mom using her walker but instead clutching onto furniture walls and handrails. Each time I would immediately locate her walker then talk to nursing staff about ensuring Mom was not wandering without the walker. Due to the move her pacing increased to sometimes 2 hours late in the day.   In early March I was notified by phone Mom had fallen after pacing 2-3 hours. The aid told me Mom DID NOT have her walker- although it was nearby? After physical exam x-rays no injury. I reinterated to head nurse that Mom had to have her walker that I know she will forget but needs prompting.  Flash forward to end of March- Mom falls again this time she breaks her other hip!

As the tipsheet points out  agitation and aggressive behavior are common manifestations of Alzheimer's  Disease. Coping with these behaviors in an effective and informed way is a key  concern for family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's.     ""Most of the time agitation and aggression  happen for a reason"" the NIA explains. ""When they happen try to find the  cause. If you deal with the causes the behavior may stop"" the NIA tipsheet  counsels.    Some examples of common causes for  aggressive behavior or agitation in a person with Alzheimer's include: pain  depression or stress constipation a feeling of loss feeling lonely and  interaction of medicines.

This is one topic that cuts me to tears and pain and may prepare others to toughen-up.     After having my wife home alone for 5-years I placed her in a Care Facility. At first my wife some 4+ years ago used to cry tears when I would depart a visit. This about wilted me. Then following one visit my wife cried so loudly and requring two employee Caregivers to block and calm her that I was frozen in my tracks. A third employee Caregiver had to tell me twice to ""Go"". The first ""Go"" I was frozen whether to depart like a rat or return to my wife and perhaps recycle the pain. As it was I departed with my wife's loud pleas ringing in my ears for weeks. Move ahead to today...     My wife is now very week but mobile slightly. She seldom reflects acknowledgement of my presence during visits. I do many things to slightly let my wife know I am there. I speak touch point or mostly sit silent waiting for the next chapter that often does not come. But yesterday 3/19 I got the silent reaction during my whole visit. When I decided to depart I said goodbye to my wife. I walked approx 15 feet and looked back and noticed my wife had wiggled up onto her spindly legs and was making an attempt to follow me. She walked approx 10 feet when her strength gave out and she just stood fortunately not falling. An employee Caregiver and I rushed to my wifes aid to cause her not to fall and got my wife back to her chair. I allowed the employee Caregiver to take charge of the verbal calming and blocking my wife while I stole away like the rat I was 4+ years before.      Of course my wife's silent attempt to following me home hurt to the bone and I while living alone wept that night for a few minutes until I told myself to grab hold of myself. My only savior is that my wife is in the best place she can be a place much better suited to handle severe Demented patients. I could never do it at home as well as my wife's Care Facility.         But the ""Going Home"" syndrome is always there and the hurt never ceases. My only saving grace is that I am a seasoned Caregiver of 9 years what ever that is supposed to be. .",False,Zolly,2011-12-15,2283.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147496211,,,AlzConnected,,,

(Yes I jig well). I sat down and she wanted to kiss me. She reflected total joy (for her Alzheimer 7 Stage). I gave her the little toffee candies I carry for her and she was over-joyed. As time went on I thought she wanted to go to bed. So I escorted her to her room put her to bed kissed her and told her I loved her.     The amazing thing is that heretofore my wife would have fought the thought of putting her to bed but this time her body language reflected that she was telling me it was OK for her to go to bed.     I know my experience reflected above does not advise of any care or medication that could aid many others.

He had been in Seattle at a geri/psych hospital getting a med review and removing his pain meds that were causing horrible hallucinations delirium and behavior issues. After being there 5 weeks he was ready to come back over the snowy mountains (5hr drive in a cabulance). When he arrived at a new memory are facility he was hunched over and not communicative. We assumed he was heavily sedated and just tired from the trip. They washed him up and put him to bed. I arrived a few hours later and we couldn't wake him. He didn't respond to anything. We waited another 1.5 hours (I couldn't face having him hospitalized again.) I noticed he wasn't swallowing.. His family practice doctor told us to send him to the ER. He gets there and has developed a fever of 104.7 degrees.  Chest X-ray is clear. Labs don't show a UTI. We put him on heavy antibiotics and his fever comes down a bit but he just never is totally conscious.  I stay the night with him and he starts to battle the tubing and IV and catheter. When my siblings arrive the dr encourages us to consider hospice. That dad will never regain what he's lost. We will be facing feeding tubes and more. One more night in the hospital then we take him to the hospice house. My family got to gather around him and love on him and the hospice nurses kept him comfortable and pain free.

Alzheimer's disease presents many practical  challenges such as dressing bathing and feeding the person. Yet many caregivers claim the  most difficult part is the inevitable ""long good-bye"" that comes as a result of  the disease's slow progressive incurable nature.    Anticipatory grief is the pain and sadness that arises in advance of an  expectant loss. It's the emotional effect associated with losing a relative  before that person dies. In the midst of anticipatory grief friends and family  of those with dementia may also battle with ambiguous loss or the confusing  feeling of interacting with someone who is not fully present mentally or  socially.

I have been reading the Caregivers Forum and WOW to what is going on in this world with ALZHEIMERS PATIENTS!!! I am 51 yrs old and in 2007 Jan my Mom moved in with me diagnosed with Alzheimers where she was declared Incompetent to make decisions!!! So here I am in the prime of my career driving an ambulance doing 911 calls and working in the ER as a Unit Sec/EMT Nurse Tech assisting ER Docs and just ended caregiving for my father for 3 years with Esophageal Cancer under Hospice where I saw him take his last breath! So here I am with medical knowledge but NOT Alzheimers patients long term!         I am the sole Caregiver for my 75 yr old Mom. I see her in the morning and I see her to bed. We are struggling financially but I love the fact that I oversee my Mom's every move. So here's the thing! WE KNOW our family members BETTER THAN ANYBODY! Don't ever let a Dr. tell me about my Mom!!! I've been her caregiver ALONE for 6 years! I know her better than anybody! In that being said....I DEPEND on a Dr.'s knowledge in some things! When I see somethings wrong like edema in her ankles or FREQUENT URINATION which is typical to have Chronic UTI's in Alzheimers patients mainly due to cleanliness/hygiene I take her to the hospital and let them run tests!          As far as Medications....WOW ...there is still a lot to learn! When we were in Orlando Fl I took her to a Memory Loss Clinic and loved the Neurologist who would test her and do CT of the brain to compare changes and tell me NO DON'T GIVE YOUR MOM ATIVAN/LORAZEPAM for anxiety because it's BAD ON THE BRAIN WAVES and can cause terrible side effects like ANGER CONFUSION and can exacerbate these symptoms! Yet I needed something for anxiety/agitation. So I gave 1/2 mg to knock the edge off and calm her down but NOT KNOCK HER OUT like they do in the Nursing Homes! I know because I just recently gave Meds in an Dementia home and ALL their ""PRN"" Meds were given regularly!!! Remember it's up to the discretion of the person giving them. So they gave them ALL THE TIME! The people were slumped over in the chairs and lethargic! Their goals as employees in the home ARE NOT my goal as a daughter caring for my MOM!          I did want to say I HAVE NEVER LIKED TRAZADONE as a medication for our family members with Dementia. It seems to be TOO MUCH and puts them in a state I DON'T like!!! BUT I did recently find that Respiridone is a medication 0.5mg (and I give my Mom 1/2) has been a God Send! It is a Pyschotropic Drug and makes my Mom kind and alert but at night helps her sleep! That's another thing about DEMENTIA PATIENTS SLEEPING!!! My God my MOM has the ""SUNDOWN"" syndrome where their hours differ. Why in the world would I FORCE my Mom to sleep when the Disease causes her NOT TO! So I sit up with her until midnight and just as she is NOW at10AM she sleeps. It's like a baby...they seem to have their own hours and I let her sleep until she wakes up BECAUSE SHE NEEDS HER SLEEP! I'm telling you people they need a PLACE TO GO where PEOPLE ""UNDERSTAND"" the Disease and even MORE are EDUCATED about the Disease! I find people ARE NOT! Even some Dr.'s are clueless! I remember when my Mom had a Heart Cathertization and AFTER...they kept telling her to ""Keep your leg still"" where they had gone up in her femoral artery! HELLO my Mom has Alzheimers....she has short term memory loss and WILL NOT remember.  So I'm standing there trying to be her ""Advoctae"" as we all try to be the best we can and I suggested the sand bags to HELP HER hold her leg down because...SHE CAN'T REMEMBER!!! This Disease is awful! I've learned soooooo much of being by my Mom's side for 6 years and seeing what all people just don't know! WE KNOW OUR FAMILY MEMBERS! And if we don't LIKE how a medication is making our family member...tell them to STOP the medication until you find something that works! I'm not talking about their Blood Pressure medicine THEY NEED I'm talking about ALL these Medications coming out that the Drs aren't sure about unless the SPECIALIZE IN ALZHEIMERS/DEMENTIA!!!! They're DRS NOT GOD! The Neurologists seem to have a better understanding of certain meds that effect the ALZHEIMERS BRAIN!!! This Alzheimers/DEMENTIA is a SPECIAL DISEASE in itself and needs to have more people who specialize in THIS ALONE!!! One other incident regarding meds....about 2 months ago I took Mom to the podiatrist to get her extremely long toe nails cut! She has Neuropathy and I didn't want her to cut them and they get infected! So after the Podiatrist cut her super long toenails he told me she had a ""Fungus"" yellow coloring underneath ALL her toenails. And I appropriately asked was there a medication she can take. And Thank God he said ""Yes but she CAN NOT take it with ARICEPT it can cause issue."" Well I knew what he was saying because I have been putting up with my Mom's Physical and Mental Abuse for 6 years and some medications just exacerbate her anger/anxiety! I know. I've seen it!          So I'm just saying that this AWFUL DISEASE deserves ""Our Knowledge"" as Caregivers and people in the medical field who ""SPECIALIZE"" in their training because OUR FAMILY IS ""SPECIAL"" to us! These People Don't know what we know about our own family member. When Mom was in the hospital LAST WEEK for Chest Pain...the Nurses gave her 5MG of Respiridone instead of .5MG!!! I kept telling them she was NOT usually this lethargic and I INSISTED going over the Meds until we figured it out! We know our Family Memeber better than ANYONE and YOU STAND UP FOR THEM because that's all they have is US!!!! Thank you for letting me VENT!!!

My FIL passed on sunday night after suffering through his last four days of hell. He had been on a kind of race for two weeks squeezing the last substages into a matter of days.   On Feb 19 he would still get up on his own (and have a fall after three metres or so) but already sleep for 20 hours a day. A week later he could no longer get up or stand without two people assisting him. He would eat no more than a little soup and drink no more than 500ml often less.  He stopped eating and drinking completly on Feb 26 and started hallucinating saw people in the garden and policemen in the house - fortunately nothing seemed to disturb him very much and we could divert him and calm him down easily. He lost almost all of his nouns but could still pray the Holy Father and Hail Mary. He developed bedsores on his shoulder and hip (decubitus) which detoriated so incredibly quickly we had to get a special mattress and wound dressings on Feb 28. That was the first day he spent completely in his bed and he was praying non stop. We mashed seroquel &amp; lorazepam into a spoonful of applesauce so he would at least find some rest at night.   On March 1 he could speak no more except for wheezing his brother's name. He was clearly in pain when we moved him carefully to reposition his body. So we got transdermal morphine patches for him. We started wetting his lips and clean his mouth with citrus flavoured qtip sticks. On March 2 he could no longer utter a sound or swallow so mucus in his mouth and throat dried up which must have caused him pain and also was responsible for rattling gurgling breathing sounds. We had to call the doc for more pain meds because his sores had become so terrible. From this late evening up to his death one of us three sat by his bed (we checked every hour or so but left him alone for 30-50 min inbetween - he had always been a very private person and needed time alone to get rest even in the very end). Pauses between quick wheezing breaths became longer. On March 3 his feet started to become cold in the afternoon while his core temperature was boiling so we knew he had reached his last hours. He died near midnight some time after I had left his side. The morphine had calmed his breathing so I believe he did not have to fight much.  I think he had not slept but dozed very little for his last 48-36 hours. He had trouble closing his eyelids then but I also guess he was too afraid. Even when he could no longer talk his eyes would stare at us in terror. He was convinced he would go to hell for sins he couldn't even remember. We tried to give him as much comfort as possible by talking and touching. I am so sorry we could not take his fear of death away. It made his dying so much harder. Now he is released.  My FIL stayed in his house until his death. His son our GF and me took care of both his parents since last April when his mom had a stroke. She passed on Dec 3 exactly three months before her husband.  After one year of 24/7 caregiving all of us are finally free.  Thank you so much for your support. I found this board late but not too late. You are an inspiration a lifeline and heroes in your own journey of caregiving.

What I have learned to do is to consider that the other person has a different perspective that is true for her (or him) and that my own perspective is true for me.  If I choose to I may post about it in order to express that I have another perspective.  Then I move on.  I don't dwell on it.   Almost every day I read something on the boards that I could become offended by.  I make a choice to skip over most of what I am offended by.    I think it is very good for people to express their various opinions and I hope members don't stop expressing their opinions because they feel someone might take offense.  What one person finds offensive the next person might find to be useful advice for their own situation.   My goal in this post is to encourage the continuance of open communication on these boards.  I have gotten a wealth of benefit from the members.  I hope my post is received in the spirit in which it was written.

A systematic review of 11 clinical trials shortlisted from electronic databases from 1995 to 2011 was carried out. The RCT showed that aromatherapy had positive effects on reduction of BPSD improvement in cognitive functions increasing quality of life enhancing independence of activities of daily living and so on. However adverse effects were noted in some studies.      The adverse effects noted in this review were allergic reactions (headaches nausea and wheezing) increased blood pressure and in some cases increased agitation.  Aromatherapy is generally safe but not safe for everyone.  Some of the following observations were with tinctures or tablets of essential oils which may if not properly diluted or compounded can lead to kidney and liver damage.          Ok now for all the observations that I have seen so far.                My mother is in the final stages of Alzheimer's and was given a rough estimate of only 6 more months of life back in November. As is very common her condition can change from day to day but still in a general direction for the worse. She reached the point where if she was even awake at all she couldn't communicate anymore and hardly showed the sign of being aware of my presence. I've been using alternative medicine for a few years now to treat my depression anxiety and also for general health. I've since discovered the overlooked value of the    herb     Rosemary and now use it to treat the symptoms of my depression. I've also noticed better clarity of thought along with an improved short term memory. I was able to get the doctor's permission to give this herb to my mother and we figured at least it couldn't hurt. Much to my surprise there's been a noticable change. There have been quite a few day now where my mom has been more focused and alert than she's been in a long time. I even got some news from one of her nurses who said my mother had a brief conversation with her. Its been at least a year or two since I can remember anything like that. This change has also been noticed by others on the nursing staff as well as her doctor who is very surprised. Now I'm not suggesting this is any kind of a ""cure"" for Alzheimer's but the improvement in my mother's condition is something to be said about Rosemary and it's given me some more quality time with her that I thought had been thing of the past.........Gary            Mary Knapp 90 a resident at Beverly Health Care is one of the dozens of participants in Loy’s study. Each day she wears on her sweater a heart-shaped patch scented with frankincense and grapefruit. Knapp described the scent as “mellow.”     Knapp’s daughter Mary Langston of Greenville said she has noticed a marked change in the past few weeks in her mother’s attention span and ability to better remember relatives in photographs and scrapbooks.  “It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately it’s like she has been reborn” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”     http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/newsstory.cfm?ID=947         My Mom has advanced Alzheimer's disease.  She had gotten to the point where she was sitting or lying down with her eyes closed all the time and would open them when spoken to.  She wasn't recognizing my brother any more for maybe 6 months.  She had to be prompted to eat was not socializing was weak and unsteady on her feet.   In March we started her on Life Long Vitality.  Within days the staff were saying you know - she seems to be doing better.  Each week we have watched her improve - with much delight! After 2 weeks she recognized my brother and with a huge smile on her face said Oh Wow!  I haven't seen you in so long!  I asked her how she was and she said ""Fine"" I said you are?  She said ""yes - VERY GOOD!""  we were grinning from ear to ear!  The following week she was strong in her legs and we didn't have to support her to walk.  She was no longer closing her eyes she was trying to talk and she was going to the social hall.   Now 3.5 months later with only 1/2 dose per day she is having great days.  She is playing bingo eating better strong in her body talking interested in working her word-find puzzles recognizing my brother whew!  Last Sunday she even had communion at the church service!  And we are all so delighted at the positive changes that have taken place with only adding the Life Long Vitality to her routine.  A story from   Stay at Home Dr. Mom  :  My Mom has advanced Alzheimer’s. She has been using the Life Long Vitality supplements for a year. She has survived a UTI a respiratory infection and in January a broken hip. In early February 2012 she was without the Life Long Vitality supplements as I was away and I couldn’t get someone from home to take the to the facility so I finally mailed a set to the assisted living. (I think she was without them for about 2 weeks or more.) I received a call a few days later saying how much better she was now that she had the doTERRA vitamins again. Then yesterday I received two calls as described here:   I received a call from Mom’s A.L. yesterday. She said Janyce your Mom is doing wonderfully. She is smiling every day and happy.   Then the Hospice Nurse called and he said “Janyce your Mom is doing so well. She is happy strong she can put 30% weight on her leg (with the broken hip) to help transfer to the wheelchair (no pain) and she loves watching TV and going to the activity room again. I feel those doTERRA vitamins are making her like this especially when we saw her decline without them and then recover quickly with them.”   [doTerra is doing someting interesting: they are combining essential oils in tablets with some of the herbs and vitamins that may also help in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  About half way down the second link is the list of the ingredients].      http://miraclesdoterra.blogspot.com/2013/02/alzheimers-and-essential-oils.html        http://miraclesdoterra.blogspot.com/2013_02_01_archive.html        The benefits of aromatherapy assisting English Rose Suites residents with sleeplessness agitation lack of appetite pain and other emotional and physical ailments have been proven repeatedly by the staff.     Currently Zinke has found that residents respond favorably to aromatherapy with essential oils.   “I don’t know how but it’s working” Zinke said. “I’m amazed.

There are many theories as to the reason for the timing  of the behaviors but no definitive answers. Most authorities conclude that it  has to do with the disturbance of the body's circadian rhythm the natural  cycle of awake/sleep periods for most people.    Dr. Malgorzata K. Bach a neurologist in the Rockford Health System who  treats many patients with dementia and runs the Memory Clinic explains that  there can be several factors that can trigger sundowning in dementia patients.""Sundowning is fairly common"" Bach said.

""For progressing dementia patients like those who have Alzheimer's there  are several factors that can exacerbate this problem"" Bach said. ""The  medications themselves for example can make it worse. Others include  unrecognized infection pain improper diet - like excessive caffeine intake  for example - and even something like constipation; these can all further  disturb the 24-hour sleep/wake cycle.""

Assoc)  -  A new program launched by the New York City Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association will help alleviate suffering and provide comfort for people with advanced dementia and Alzheimer's disease and their families.   The  Palliative Care for Advanced Dementia: Training and Implementation Program  will teach care providers in nursing homes to better identify and manage the physical pain emotional distress weight loss and sleep disturbances often experienced by advanced dementia patients.   Lou-Ellen Barkan President and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association New York City Chapter said ""In New York State almost half of all nursing home residents have dementia. The fact is residential care facilities often underutilize palliative and hospice care for the Alzheimer's patients. By bridging the gap between the theoretical and the practical this new training program will help improve care create a better environment and reduce emotional distress for those with dementia their caregivers and care providers.""   The training program will be implemented at three nursing homes including Cobble Hill Health Center the Isabella Geriatric Center and Jewish Home Lifecare in collaboration with their partners: Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice &amp; Palliative Care; Metropolitan Jewish Hospice &amp; Palliative Care; and Calvary Hospice.   The program is based on the ""comfort-focused care approach"" developed by the Beatitudes Campus in Phoenix Arizona and their partner Hospice of the Valley. Beatitudes has found that its approach results in calm and peaceful environments where residents are relaxed and more alert and staff and visitors are less stressed.   Over the course of the 30-month program and with the participation of world-renowned experts in palliative- and dementia care the New York City Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association in collaboration with Beatitudes and Hospice of the Valley will provide training in the following areas:     pain and symptom management;  reducing medically aggressive and cure-focused treatments for terminally ill dementia residents;  addressing the emotional distress and challenging behaviors experienced by many residents with late stage dementia; and  implementing specific measures and care practices that can provide comfort to residents with late stage dementia   Another important component of the project is the comprehensive pre- and post-pilot programmatic and cost evaluations.   Jed A. Levine Executive Vice President and Director of Programs and Services at the New York City Chapter said ""This approach to palliative care for persons with advanced dementia has the potential to transform and revolutionize care for persons with Alzheimer's in nursing homes and dramatically improve the quality of their life the lives of their family members and the staff members who are doing the work.""   At the conclusion of the effort the New York City Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association will also publish a manual  Palliative Care for People with Dementia: Guidelines for Program Implementation  that will give health care providers a clear understanding of the programmatic and organizational steps needed to achieve an effective palliative care program. The guide will be disseminated to every nursing home in New York State and elsewhere across the nation.                Barkan added ""This initiative has real potential to make important advancements in care for New Yorkers in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's. The Chapter would like to thank all of our generous funders for making this important training program possible.""",False,Myriam,2011-12-06,3326.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147495295,,,AlzConnected,,,

On the bright side:  My mother has not hit my dad or made any kind of aggressive hostile physical contact with him since early October (2012).  That week the three of us went to visit her PCP who laid down the law after seeing the bruises and marks on both my parents' arms.   ""If I ever see or hear about anything like this again I  will  call Adult Protective Services!""        Yesterday she took ""the sharpest razor blade I could find"" (her words) and cut large holes in the carpeting in each of the three bedrooms [Backstory:  She says she has been asking my dad for years to get new carpeting or some other kind of flooring in the bedrooms.  In her defense it is the original shag carpeting installed in the house in 1979 or 1980.]  My dad estimates the hole in the back bedroom to be 3' by 4' or @ 12 square feet.    This past Wednesday night around 11:00 Dad went to take a shower and when he went into the back bedroom the main bedroom at the opposite end of the house he found that my mother stripped the bed--pulled off all the bedclothes blanket sheets left everything on the floor.  She had met him near the entry hall giving him a look and telling him ""You have some work to do in the bedroom.""  Dad ended up going to bed on a bare mattress just pulling up a blanket or two from the floor.  An hour or two later my mother burst into the room turning on the lights yelling slapping her hand HARD on the mattress right next to him on the surface of the nightstand the surface of the dresser near the bed... making a big display of noise and intimidation.  Dad says she had a really wild look in her eyes and he admits to being genuinely frightened.    The next day the home health care provider got my mother in to see her PCP again.  The doctor took her off her antidepressant (not sure which drug that is) and added Clonazepam at bedtime along with the Seroquel she's been on since October.  The Clonazepam does a good job of putting her to sleep but does nothing for her worsening behavioral issues.    So... I've already found a skilled nursing facility.  My dad and I visited back in October and really liked what we saw.  It's 20 miles from the house women's ALZ unit @ 16 or 18 beds three of them open.  I could (theoretically) get her admitted tomorrow morning.  It'll probably take me a week to get down there as I live in another state.  I'm the only child btw.    Long-term care insurance will kick in @ 100% on Day #101 to term savings will cover the rest.  My question is how does one go about this?  One thought it taking her to lunch and then instead of going back home just dropping her off at the nursing home.  Too cruel?  She senses maybe even knows this is coming.  She was instrumental in putting her own parents in a nursing home 15-20 years ago.

He was having trouble sleeping and had tried several medications so his neurologist put him on Seroquel at night. It helped him sleep but we noticed he started going down hill. He needed help walking started whispering started taking longer eating. I called the neurologist and told him what was going on and asked if we needed to stop the Seroquel. He didn't give me any advise over the phone as to the medication but said he wanted to see him. I was afraid to stop the medication without consent because I didn't know if there would be any side effects. He was on it for about a month.   We get to the neurologist appointment with my FIL in a gait belt and in a wheel chair. A month ago he was walking and talking normal. The doctor said that the decline could very well have been from the Seroquel and to stop it and put him on 5 mg Valium for sleep which is working fine. He also said that it could be the disease progression. He ordered a CT scan to check for a stroke and also mentioned from his symptoms that Lewy Body dementia could be a possibility along with Alzheimer's.  The problem is that my FIL is still declining. He had no leg strength the last time I helped him to stand which was two days ago. He's been asleep since then. I woke him up yesterday morning to change him and get him up for the day and he whispered he wanted to stay where he was. That was the only thing he said all day that made sense. He woke up for brief periods of time and I tried to feed him and get fluids in him. He fell back asleep while I was doing that. I'm afraid he's going to aspirate and I know he's dehydrated. When I put a straw to his mouth he couldn't remember how to suck out of it so I put my finger over the top and dribbled water into his mouth.   He moans when moved even when his dog moves on the bed. I know he's hurting so I called home health. The on call nurse came out and checked him. His vitals were fine. She called his neurologist to let him know he was in pain and his nurse said to take him to the hospital. That seemed ridiculous to me since moving him even more would be excruciating to him so I'm giving him Tylenol until I hear back from his family doctor. I don't want to give him anything stronger because I know that will make his decline worse but I don't want him in pain either.   This is new territory for me and I'm scared. I can handle it when I get on solid ground with sound advise. The neurologist said it could take up to two months for the Seroquel to get out of his system and there could be a little improvement IF that is what caused his decline. I'm not holding out hope for a bounce back. I  just need some advise on how to handle what's going on now.   Sorry for the long post but the more information you have the better advise you can give.   Thanks  Katie,False,strange1,2012-05-31,191.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494974,,,AlzConnected,,,

It's localized mostly in buttocks area. Therapy thinks she's slowly getting better.  She can walk with walker sit reasonably comfortably ( at least till late afternoon and then she seems to get  more uncomfortable- pain might be 5-7). Getting in and out of bed is a bit harder and her pain is worse around 5am. She also has mild cerebral palsy which causes extra stiffness/arthritis and history of delerium with many types of meds that affect central nervous system.      We're between a rock and hard place with her pain meds.  She had an ulcer two years ago and is  not supposed to be on NSAIDS. However they started her on Motrin prn 3 weeks ago w understanding it would just be 10 days and hopefully it would resolve. It hasn't yet. She's also still on Protonix to protect her stomache. Her routine pain meds are tylenol 3x day and Lidoderm patch on her back) I also am starting massage 1-2 x a week.     They added Vicodin prn a few weeks ago when motrin wasn't quite helping enough which worried me ( It snowed her  two years when given for hip fracture and she also had hallucinations- though we didn't know what was causing that for sure) given her sensitivities and past experience.  I ended up letting NH try it and now agreed to let them give it to her at night which is her worse time.So far I've asked them to hold off on giving it during the day. So they are still giving her motrin. They did try one Vicodin dose at breakfast when she gets the majority of her other meds and she did okay( this was done without my okay..)  We've not noticed hallucinations or odd behavior though i think her short term memory is getting worse- though I don't think this has anything to do with this.      New wrinkle- she has a bad cold and cough(no fever) and it was recommended to hold off on massage as it can push infection thru blood stream.      Care mtg yesterday they said they would honor our request to hold Vicodin to evening shift but felt that they could do a better job with her pain if she got it more often.  They did agree to add another shower/jaccuzi bath to her schedule to provide more heat.      I am very worried about using the motrin though I don't know the reality of if she is really at risk for bleeding and ulcers given she's on protonix.  It also doesn't work as well as Vicodin.  I want to help her get through this pain. Part of me wants to let them try the Vicodin as needed to see if can help"" break the cycle"" of pain as they say. My fear is that she'll not be able to get off it and there could be some long term side effects not to mention addiction issues. I may be getting ahead of myself but I feel like I have to stay one step ahead.  She's been given things in the past that initially were okay only to have them not work later on- Neurontin Seroquel Keppra and Namenda is suspicious too( by not work I mean severe delusions hallucinations and combativeness!!)      She's got a very delicate nervous system. I'm also committed to trying alternative treatments like acupuncture and massage but now that's a bit on hold till we get this cold under control.

It has gotten better slowly.  At first she was in considerable agony transfering in and out of bed and using the toilet and she couldn't walk much.PT thinks its some kind of sciatica but we don't know the cause- disc spinal stenosis or just the piriformas muscle.    She can now  use her walker for short distances toilet participate in activities etc though she has some low level pain on and off throughout the day.  I think most of the pain is at night. We have a care mtg with NH staff today so I hope to get more info.     In the meantime an x ray was done and found no fracture. Dr. wrote a script for an MRI and said we could schedule it for a few weeks out and if she's improving we could cancel it.  I'm up in the air about whether to go ahead with the MRI. I haven't actually scheduled it yet( it should be for next week if we follow the doctor's plan)     Mom's been getting PT 3x a week- heat ultrasound therapy and a little massage. She's also starting to get a massage therapist visit 1-2x a week.  They have her on prn doses of motrin voltaren gel and vicodin( night only).  I'd love to get her off the motrin( she had an ulcer a few years ago) and vicodin.I've also been giving her cherry juice daily with other stuff thrown in and the dr. started glucosamin/chondrotin at my request.      The reason I think it might help to have MRI is we would know the source of the pain and it would open up other options to try like injections/ablations etc in case she plateaus. Plus we might be able to get her off these meds.      What worries me about the MRI is the sheer physical discomfort of it PLUS the anxiety it might cause her.  Will this make her pain worse afterwards? Will she backslide? She actually has to have two MRI's - one for her spine and one for her hip and each are about 45 minutes long.  ( I would do them on different days) I was told I could not sit with her either but staff would be with her.  I'm uneasy about giving her ativan or something for anxiety. I'm not sure it works well for her and she's xtra sensitive to meds to begin with. I could give her a Vicodin right before to at least minimize the pain.       What do you all think?  A nurse friend who works with the elderly told me to give it some more time as it could just be taking her longer to heel. I sort of agree with that but still would like to get some input from you all.  I'd appreciate it.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494967,,,AlzConnected,,,

If you happen to know the brand and amount of supplements that would be great too.  I'm open to anything!     I'm asking because my mother is limited in what she can take pill-wise for pain.  She's been having sciatic like pain for the past month. She's temporarily on Motrin(prn) but can't do this long term because she had an ulcer a few years ago .  She's still on Protonix so I feel a little better about her being on it as that protects her stomache but it's a little nerve wracking.     They've also given her Vicodin several times late at night or early morning and she appears to have tolerated it okay but again I worry as it's pretty high- powered and she has had many many side effects with pain meds in the past. So again I don't want to make it a habit.  Fortunately we found out that in the short term she hasn't appeared to have any side effects but i've asked the nurses in the NH to only give it to her on 3rd shift. (It's prn).      She also gets Voltaren gel tylenol and a lidoderm patch physical therapy 3x a week and she's starting to get massages once or twice a week. This seems to be helping but she's still where she was.       Mom's dr put her on glucosamine/chondrotin but said it can take up to 3 months before you know if it will work. I don't know the amount yet.  I've also been giving her organic tart cherry juice sometimes mixed with pineapple juice as both of these have things that are supposed to help.

1358,6210ba6c7b65de9a5b67f897,2147495320,2013-02-13 09:22:00,Please read: To crush meds or not!,Drugs      It is important that you understand that drugs cannot always be crushed or chewed.   There are several reasons why certain tablets and capsules must be left intact. Some just taste bad and are coated with something more pleasing. Other drugs are irritating to the stomach and the tablet or contents of a capsule are coated to delay the release of the active ingredient in the drug until it reaches your intestines. Under the tongue drugs may not work correctly if they are altered by crushing and chewing. Technology is also a consideration. The drug industry has learned to design tablets and capsules to release medication slowly into the body. This allows for more convenient dosing intervals - taking the drug once or twice a day rather than four or more times a day.  Often this slower release of the active ingredients in the drug helps to prevent side effects and maintain a good level of the drug in your body. * Slow release products can often be identified by abbreviations in the name. Examples include (but are not limited to):  -CR (controlled release) -CD (extended release) -LA (long acting) -SR (sustained release) -XR (extended release) -TR (timed release) -EL (extended length) and -TD (time delay)  Other extended release products do not have any abbreviations in the name for clues. One example is Oxycontin a powerful narcotic pain reliever.  Crushing or chewing these drugs will often allow too much of the active ingredients to be delivered too fast. This may result in bad health consequences.    To sum up for people who cannot swallow whole tablets or capsules:    - Some medications should not be crushed or chewed.  - Read the printouts that come with most drug prescriptions and ask your Physician and Pharmacist specific questions.  - If you discover a problem consult with your Physician Pharmacist Nurse and Dietitian about possible alternatives such as liquids immediate release products or using the contents of some capsules in soft food or feeding tubes so long as these particles are not crushed or chewed.     Additional Information    The following is a web site to provide you with more information on what drugs can NOT be crushed or chewed.       Virtual Hospital,False,Luvofmylife,2012-03-07,224.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147495320,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom is a retired school teacher and city librarian so was quite a sharp lady until the last few years.  She has other health issues as well.  My husband takes her for injections weekly to boost her blood count to help stave off the need for frequent transfusions.  There is believed to be an obstruction of some kind in her kidney or bowels but at this age and with her physical conditions the doctors would not do surgery so thought there would be no reason to put her through all the tests to see if she has cancer or not.  Her injections are at the cancer center.  We see her minimum of 3 times a week.   She had a bad fall a year ago where she broke her pelvis wrist several bones in her face and also had bleeding on the brain.  It was really touch and go for a while but then she got better and after a couple months in rehab she was able to return to the assisted living center.  They love her so much there that they hired more aides just to help with her individual needs so she could continue to live there and not at a nursing home.  It's a wonderful place.     Each time mom has a spill or spends time in the hospital her dementia is in full swing.  She is combative believes everyone is out to murder her have put poisen in her food so she refuses to eat and pulls out IV's and her catheter so she has to be restrained to keep from doing harm to herself.  Once in the hospital with a broken hip we received a frantic call from a nurse saying they'd lost mom couldn't find her anywhere.  She should not have been able to walk but was missing.  When her dementia is real bad we find she feels no pain maybe it blocks her pain receivers or something.  Well they finally found her hiding in a closet sure the mob was planning a hit on her.  Each time she goes through one of these really bad experiences and them recovers she never is quite as good as she was before.  I think this is a natural progression of her condition.  Her good days are not all that good anymore.     She was in the hospital with pneumonia for 8 days over thanksgiving but again miraclously recovered.  She has been in an unusually good mood since she went back home however her memory is quite a bit worse.  She is seeing things more is sure she's been places lately people are stealing her mail there's her little daughter watching cartoons (her daughter is 63) and so on.  That's fine we know not to try to correct her but tell her we'll take care of it when she's upset about things.  But the hardest thing is she doesn't not remember and doesn't believe she cannot walk anymore.  Her bed and chair alarms go on about 30 times a day when she tried to sneak out of her bed so ""they"" cant watch her. So far the workers have been able to catch/stop her but she is also sneaky and sometimes is able to disconnect her alarm.  We've talked to her tried to explain she does nto walk on her own anymore.  We point out her wheel chair which she thinks is a walker.  We have signs around telling her to ring the buzzer when she needs something but I doubt she can really read anymore.       They use a baby monitor on her as well to try to listen to any stirrings and them they run to her before she can try to get up.  We just don't know how to keep her safe from hurting herself.     Do you have any suggestions???",False,colliemom,2013-01-04,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494429,,,AlzConnected,,,

(ER required 4 pt restraints for 7 hours; absolutely the worst thing yet).  Doctors in hospital recommended hospice and I decided it would be more support for her and helpful to keep her out of pain.

My mother has been seemingly at the very end of ALZ for the last 4 months. We started her on Hospice in October. The caregiver and the hospice personnel visit her five days a week at home where is cared for by my 75-year old father. He loves her and wants him with her but it has truly become an incredibly daunting task. She is completely immobile nonverbal and shows no response to any of her children. She is incontinent and her body is starting to pull itself back in especially her hands. So now she has developed bedsores on her feet and hands. He is insistent to keep her bathed everyday even when she doesn't need it and to keep her home even when it appears she would be better in a hospital. Thhis makes for exhausting work for everyone and it causes her pain to be moved.      So now we are left with trying to rotate our visits at least once a week to spend time with them checking in with Dad and the caregives and that leaves you with guilt and sorrow. God Bless my father for his true love and devotion but I am afraid it is going to take him with her. Honestly I am praying the end comes soon. I believe our souls go to a better place and I look at my poor mom trapped in her lifeless body and it makes me angry so I pray God takes her soon.     The frustrating thing is that I have had a sibling show up recently after not being around for years and she is staying there because of her own circumstances not because she chose to care for Mom. And suddenly she is a saint because she is there all the time and we only come ""once a week.""

For the benefit of others who will drop in here on this thread I am copying what you ladies wrote:          Hello Dusti       I'm new to the group and the disease. I joined this group for tips and support. My mom age 69 was recently diagnosed with dementia. My father has Parkinsons and resides in a nursing home for rehab. I am struggling with this everyday as I am becoming (by default) her primary care giver. I have 3 older siblings as 2 live out of state. I have 2 small children and recently started my own business. I am overwhelmed. I find myself crying all the the time. I don't know the 1st step in moving forward. Please help.       Benita      and       Hi I'm Carrie and I am new to this site. I love my husband but I hate this Alzheimer's Disease and dementia. He is so agitated all the time and when I try to get him to take a shower or anything like that he yells at me for pestering him. I feel like I am at my wits end.                Welcome both of you. Your story is different from one another yet the pain and fear you live with is the same we all experience. You have found a safe haven on this site and people who truly care.              Benita  you are becoming a caregiver by default not by choice and that is a very tough assignment. Of course you are overwhelmed especially with small children and a new business. That is more than many others could handle in itself without adding dementia and caregiving.          Your first steps will be to determine just what kind of dementia the physicians suspect as this does make a big difference in treatment. Others will post advice on how to pursue further evaluation; please do so. I know right now you have enough else to deal with but information and knowledge will empower you.           This does not need to become your sole responsibility and no one has the right to expect that of you. Some people say it takes a special person to become a full-time Alz caregiver. I believe it takes much much more than a special person - it takes the perfect storm of elements coming together in one primary person.         It takes patience strength faith stamina commitment a drive to continually reassess and re-evaluate and learn diplomacy in dealing with professionals organizational skills and a deep interest in continuing to learn. It takes help from other individuals in various forms it takes a solid financial foundation or the knowledge of how to secure funding and it takes someone who can put aside almost everything else in his her life to care for the Alz patient as the disease progresses. It takes a strong person with a strong sense of self with confidence and determination. Insight and introspection are essential.           More than anything else though is faith. Without it you will turn bitter burn out feel like a failure and resent the person you've dedicated your life to taking care of. There are people who can do this without a strong religious belief of course although I cannot imagine how they face each day. It is just plain hard!          Your children need you and you need to focus on your business. Your siblings will need to step up and help once your mother's needs are identified; this is not a task you should undertake alone. People here on this Web site will offer help all the way so please let us share our experiences with you.             Carrie  I have a husband with early vascular dementia and multiple chronic illnesses. He is on hospice and while still ambulatory he is quite sick. He was always peaceful and cheerful and easy to get along with but now he too gets annoyed with my shower reminders. My husband is super sensitive not at all his old self and sleeps 15+ hours a day probably to avoid having to think about all he has lost. It is so hard on us to watch our life partner change like this never knowing how to make it better to make it go away. And it won't.          Welcome both of you. I know you will find support here as I have for more than a year with my own mother with Alz. She passed away last month at 93 and now I must pour more effort into making a better life with my husband. So I have seen where you two are and I feel for you.          Pray my friends pray. God has brought me through it all so far and continues to care for me. Doesn't get easy but at least I can handle what comes.             Wishing you both blessings!,False,Nora,2012-01-23,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494489,,,AlzConnected,,,

Mom is sensitive to meds- what to do?,Hi     Looking for some advice on pain options for my mom and how to deal with a nursing home and doctor that prescribed something that worries me. I moved my mom to a new NH closer to me ( old one was 7 hours away) 2 1/2 months ago and up until a few weeks ago has been doing great.     She started having major  bad lower back and buttocks pain right after christmas.  We think she hurt her back after getting in and out of our car though there was no sign of that at the time. She woke up the next morning with pain.  Her usual dose of tylenol a pain patch and voltaren gel haven't resolved it. They tried giving her Motrin 600 mg 2- 3 x a day ( she can't take this long term though because she had an ulcer 2 years ago)  a few days ago and it's not making that much difference. She's also had 5 session of physical therapy where they do heat ultrasound and a little massage.  None of this is really providing enough relief.  Her NH and hospital xrays were negative for fractures. Therapy thinks maybe SI nerve? muscular pain. She does have osteoporosis in her spine and some arthritis. She also has a mild case of cerebral palsy and has had muscle cramps in the past.      Symptoms are major discomfort when transferring in and out of bed.  (It was worse a week ago) She complains of constant pain in her lower back and describes the area- sometimes in her buttocks too.  Sometimes pain when getting on toilet.  She still does some activities but has been pulling back some because of pain and wanting to rest on her bed. I found out she has been walking daily with restorative therapy even though she tells the aide she has pain she's going to do it anyway.  I saw her walk today and she did okay. My mother is very tough and will push thru pain but I can tell something isn't right. We've not had any other diagnostic tests at this point. She does have osteporis in her spine. Her mood is till very good and she's still being her sweet self in spite of this.       NH is supposed to call me before they make a med change. However when I arrived today I was told by a nurse that doctor's office had ordered Vicodin  5/325 mg PRN and it was supposed to come in late tonight!!   After some discussion with the nurse who fortunately is very nice she put a note in the chart that I want to hold off on giving mom the VIcodin until I can talk to the day shift staff/dr tomorrow.  Called the doctor and she's out until next Tuesday so have a msg in to her.  This nurse however is pushy about this medication- I understand she sees my mom suffering and wants to help her...       However we've had many many problems with my mom in the past with different pain medications.In fact many problems with many medications that affect the central nervous system. Bottom line- they've caused behavior and mood changes hallucinations etc.  Mom was on Vicodin prn for a hip fracture 2 years ago which made her extremely drowsy and may or may not have also caused hallucinations. Hard to to tell because she was on other meds that may have been a problem as well.  Soon after her hip fracture rehab and treatments she began a long drawn out series of psych problems.      Can you blame me for not wanting to try Vicodin again?       I know we need to do more to help mom and I've started researching pain specialists and alternative treatments.  Mom is now on a new med regimin and has been very stable for over 4 months. I'm SCARED to mess with it. I can't imagine Vicodin being a long term option that will work but should we try it to see what happens? I suppose we could stop it if we see side effects or interactions but I've been thru so much I don't know if I can deal with it again!  And will she really be okay again?     I'm afraid the NH is going to push me to try it. They see her hurting and Motrin hasn't been working.  The nurse supervisor is a little brusque and I'm concerned she's not going to be sympathetic to holding off.       Tramadal is another option but is also something that she took for awhile ( again with other suspicious meds) and ended up having a psych episode so that med worries me too.  I have a good rapport with mom's doctor but she's away till next Tuesday. I suppose I can talk to one of her colleagues first. I'd like to see if they have suggestions for how to diagnose the issue increasing therapy other treatements etc.                                                                                                         What would you all do?  Am I being to hyper about trying Vicodin?  She I push back and insist on more tests a pain specialist referral?  More therapy?  They only see her 3x a week and the ultrasound treatments I'm not sure are working?  This is freaking me out a bit and want to try to stay calm and rational.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494556,,,AlzConnected,,,

My day is a so-so kind of day.   This morning I had difficulty speak in complete sentences and would stutter or forget for a minute what I was trying to say. Twice I got up from the livingroom sofa and got half way to where I was going. That can drive you nuts!Talk about being absent minded...it was like driving in a strange place using your GPS and suddenly with out warning it goes dead and you get that sence of being lost. Yes gentle reader I know it comes with age. However in my case old age I am sure plays a part but I know it is mostly Mr Alzhiemer messing with me again.  It's times like that that you want to give yourself a wack up side the head but then you know that wouldn't help and besides it hurts.  For me with Alzheimer's these sort of things happen too often. There are some nights as it gets dark I start to panic the darkness is a fearful place for me some nights. Lisa got some little plug in wall lights and put them in our long hallway and bathrooms. That helps quite a bit and is very comforting. This New Years starting with New Years Eve guess what? You got it gentle reader Mr. Alsheimer started screwing around again.Yup two out of three the little light bulbs burned out. The bulbs are the type you use to use on the christmas tree. Now we have those tiny LED type ones ones.Great! so now I dealing with the dark again and I can't steal bubs from the tree either.  Thanks Mr. Alzheimer I really didn't need your New Years gift. Ok gentle reader. I need to tell you we do still have the tree up. It's like one of those artifical green jobs prelighted and to take it down you just jam it into the box when you remember where the heck the box is.  Today I found it! and that's what I did...jammed the tree...lights and all in to the box. There done. I forgot where I put the packing tape to seal the box so that became a project. I have other stuff too that need to come down but you don't want to rush into these things. Lately my motto is ""if you can put off today what you can do tomorrow do it."" Besides I like Christmas decorationsThe lights bring me comfort and peace it's the putting up and taking down that's a pain.  Gentle reader I got a neighbor across the street who has a two story house complete with gables and everything. He hangs all kinds of lights and wreaths all over the house. Looks like he also had a bunch of stuff inside too. It was fun watching him put it all up then take it all down....That's not for me thank you. If I did that they would be up all year round if I didn't kill myself in doing all that climbing on the roof and gables.  But this darkness deal....that scary to most Alzheimer's folks. If your in a lighted area and about to walk into the dark area and you have Alzheimer's the fear that that situation creates at times is beyond discription. It's like your going to step off the edge of light into a dark bottomless void. It doesn't happen all the time but when it does it is terrifying experience.  One way you can help someone with this fear is to paint the wall behind the toilet black. By doing that the Alzheimer's patient  doesn't fall over the toilet and is stopped by the blackness. Another safety item is to put a colorful toilet seat on the toilet thus making it highly visiable. Another thing is not to have round trash bathroom kitchen and study baskets. It's a good idea to hide them or by ones with covers. You see the one with Alzheimer's may think it is a toilet and try to use it.  Many accidents and falls dear reader causing broken hips is stuff on the floor around the traveled areas of the house.  Real and artifical flowery plants can also be dangerous because they smell good and can be seen as a food item. Covering wall plugs that are not in use should be cover with those plastic plugs that protect children. these are good to protect Alzheimer folks too.  Well gentle reader gotta go it's laundry time and I was going to do that yesterday but today is yesterday's tomorrow and....well you get the idea. I'll see you around the next visit. Remember all this is Mr. Alzheimers fault.  You know the spelling grammer etc.  Etc. is a good word especially if your forgetful like me...

All of you have helped more than you know. I am now in need of help and support.      We had to move my mom in a SNF last September. I am the youngest of seven and have been working together with a brother who is  the executor and POA my sister who lives out of state but was very involved with the move and everything last year. All three of us do have medial POA.            I landed in the hospital last year and was on medical leave for four months. I was in intensive counseling to help me learn to take care of myself so I could be there for my mom. Those months off allowed me to learn about this awful disease spend a good deal of time with my mom as well as get to the staff (priceless).     It also allowed me the privilege of being the one that mom will express her fears to show her anxiety and deal with her outbursts (which thankfully now are not often).           My brother sister and I have worked as a good cohesive team until recently. My mom has been in severe back pain for awhile and the MRI severe spinal stenosis and bulging discs. I have been working with her doctors and pain specialists and have not had a lot of success but we have been managing with meds the best we can.       The SNF has recently remodeled a new wing designed for Alzheimer's and dementia residents and my brother has not been completely on board but both my sister and I believe it will be a good move for her in the long run.  I also need to me tion that neither of my siblings have taken the time to read anything I have sent links to in order to help understand the disease and the behaviors.  Anyway I have been the main contact for any issues with mom and all of her medical appts. med change and doctor consultations etc... Last Tuesday my sister was in town and went to visit my mom for a longer time than she normally does it was also trick or treat at the facility and my brother and his wife were bringing the candy and running late.  I was traveling on business (I work full-time) and landed back home around 7:00 that night and my brother called me before I even got home.  He was upset saying that mom was in horrible pain and she had not been able to sit down all night and had been walking and walking (she does this and is known as the walker) and he was tired and couldn't walk anymore and needed to get home. He thought she should go to the ER because there was something very wrong. He said he went to the main nurse and he blew him off. I know the nurse very well and I said I would call him and see what was going on. I talked to the male nurse and also talked to the nurse assigned to her that night as well as her aid....they all told me that mom was in pain but that it didn't seem horrible. They did say that she had been out walking a lot. In talking again with the main nurse I suggested that I thought she was over-stimulated and of course it was late and in sun down mode as well and he agreed. He aside he would check to see what she could have and call me back.   In the meantime my brother left as I assured him that I would take care of everything and would go to the facility if needed (40 minutes away). The nurse called back to tell me they would her risperdal as she is on PRN and would call me back in an hour to let me know how she was doing.     I called my brother when he got home to let him no what was going on and explained that after talking with the staff it was felt that she was overstimulated and I said I agreed with that assessment. Well HE GOT PISSED and started yelling at me and saying that I was calling him a liar and didn't believe she was in pain. I explained that I believed she was in pain but she was also showing signs of extreme anxiety and she deals with this by walking and this is something that is normal with Alzheimer's. I was clear that I thought it was a combination but he could only hear that I didn't believe it was just pain. He then also went on to say that it is obvious that I want to control everything and will do what I want anyway just like moving mom into the new unit. He was given the same opportunity to speak with the director and tour the facility as did my sister. She believes it is a good move and said he would go along with what we thought.     Well it has been a week now and he is still not speaking to me. I have sent texts to provide updates with no response. Another sent today explaining mom will move into her ""new home"" next week and no response again. So I sent another one just asking if he received my text and received a ""yes"". I responded that it is clear he is still angry and not talking with me and that it really hurts and disappoints me (he does not get along with 4 other siblings so now I feel shut out like them). His response was well life is full of shit and disappointment. Bottom line is it doesn't matter what I said about the memory u it it didn't matter. It's your way or else! You said you are doing.you are trying YOUR best but I don't know how it became you and not all of us"". He also said that he will stay out of everything I do and to do what I want and he will take care of what he is supposed to do (financial and paperwork).     I am so sorry this is so long but it felt good to get it out even though I am in tears again. I will say that I did call the Alzheimer's hotline last Tuesday so I could vent and have a sympathetic ear but not the same as the support this group gives.     Also I have not talked talked to my sister all week because she is too busy getting her house ready to sell (I was doing the same last month while working and visiting mom but still talked to her daily).  I know that I am now sounding bitter and I guess I am starting to feel that way and I don't like it.     Any advice or wisdom is welcome.

I have medical and financial power of attorney.  I think my brother would like to be aggresive and push for surgery.  My sister and I are more pragmatic.  Why save her from heart issues to linger into stage 7 alzheimers.  But it is so hard to see her suffer.     Jillann,False,jillann,2011-12-20,78.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493967,,,AlzConnected,,,

""bu bu bu bu"".        So I believe that she will never walk again.   She will be able to transfer with assistance from the bed to the bed side commode or to a wheel chair.   (Right now transferring exhausts her and causes great pain so she usually falls back to sleep immediately after getting back in the bed.)     Has anyone else been through a hip break when they don't operate?       Luckily her ALZ facility is attached to a skilled nursing facility.  Does Medicare help with any portion of skilled nursing?  For how long?  (She's not a candidate really for rehab)     How much care does that really get... I feel like Mom will need someone with her all the time.       How can Hospice help?     I'm also considering that with this fall I may actually be able to have her at home after a few weeks.  Before she was so active and agitated it wasn't really possible.  But now I think I could do it with the right equipment and nursing help.     Looking for any advice personal stories etc.     Thank you!",False,amandams,2011-12-20,60.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147494320,,,AlzConnected,,,

After going over when my husband first noticed when his symptoms started and completing his physical and cognitive exam (0/30) he was diagnosed in severe stages of Alzheimer's dementia. As his caregiver this came as no shock to me. It hit my husband like a mac truck.   The first thing the neurologist suggested was that we put my FIL in a home. We immediately declined that option stating that we had nothing against nursing homes but that we had all of his needs taken care of at home. The doctor kept pushing trying to tell us that it was going to get much worse. I told him that I knew full well what was ahead of us on down the road and I have home health at the moment respite sitters when I need them and his PCP would order hospice when the time came.   My FIL is happy physically healthy very loved and cared for at home. I see no reason to place him unless for some reason he becomes violent and we can't handle him.   What I don't know how to do is ease my husband's pain. I don't understand how he had blinders on in the first place but they've been stripped off and he's hurting. I want to make it better for him but I have my hands so full with caring for my FIL children home etc.   I welcome any suggestions on helping my husband deal with this. I've tried to explain to him that there are much worse forms of dementia that he could have and we really are lucky that he's happy pretty laid back and content.   I've got to get off here and get my FIL to the hospital for his EKG so I can get the go ahead from his neurologist to start his Seroquel.

Arden Courts?,"Are we allowed to discuss specific brand names on this message board?     For the past not-quite-two-months my mother is currently in the skilled nursing level of a local nonprofit CCRC that sadly is quite expensive (10K+ per month!).  If she had lived in the CCRC longer before her decline she would have qualified for the great bargain of the 'life care' plan where it's about 3K/month whatever your level of care.  But sigh that is water under the bridge--no longer an option for us.       One of many reasons I was attracted to the CCRC was that it has a Medicare-5-star-rated nursing level of care.  However now that we are in it (since Oct. 1  it's of course not quite as expert as one would hope.  They don't have a memory-care specialty and in my opinion it shows.  I was particularly upset that they discontinued her pain meds without discussing it with me. She broke her hip (while in the SNF) on Oct. 28  and is still recovering from the surgery.  They said (on Nov.   that they had stopped all painkillers because she didn't verbally complain of pain.  I wanted to say SHE HAS DEMENTIA.  WHAT SHE SAYS IS NOT RELIABLE.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ A BOOK ABOUT DEMENTIA.  Fortunately the PT person arrived late to the care planning meeting and strongly recommended putting her back on painkillers!  It didn't seem like they were going to do so just based on my thoughts and opinions.  I can understand if they were reluctant to use opiate-type painkillers but Tylenol? She was literally on nothing at all for pain.      There are a number of other little concerns like that (bed alarm going off nonstop while she was trying to sleep/clearly not moving and no staff did anything about it until I disconnected it;  telling me in another care planning meeting that she is on prn Ativan when actually it had now been increased to three times a day--the medical director didn't even bring the med list to the care planning meeting so she didn't know --things like that.)        So I have been looking at alternatives.  Obviously one concern is also that we will run out of money.  Right now Medicare is paying because of the broken hip but eventually it will be back out of mom's savings again. I wish I had a road map to how long Mom will live to help me make good decisions but as you all know none of us are gifted with that information on this journey. . .      So am looking at assisted-living/memory-care places nearby.  But I'm shocked how little information is available to help me evaluate them!  I can get more information on the internet about paper shredders or TVs than I can on assisted-living places.   Caring.com seems to have a few reviews but other than that very little.?!      There is one assisted-living place in Silver Spring MD that seems pretty good called Arden Courts--seems to be part of a small chain?  But they don't have a SNF attached and who knows how long it will be before she needs that again.  (Mom is late Stage 6 at this point.)   Also it's not very close to my home--probably 40-45 minutes' drive each way.  Heavy traffic in that direction.  (The CCRC is 10 minutes so is hard to beat.)  A coworker had a relative at Arden Courts and had a good experience and I just generally got a good feel from it on my tour.  So generally a positive impression and is $6K/month so would save at least $3000 a month!  But that 45-minute drive really worries me.  As does the idea that she might decompensate quickly and then I'll be shopping for yet another placement. She certainly decompensated very quickly after this move (to the CCRC independent living then to the SNF)     So I'm still looking at other places.  Right nearby me is also a Sunrise facility at similar price of about $6K/month.  Again does not have a SNF.  Seemed nice when I toured it 6 months ago.  My brother who lives a thousand miles away was skeptical --he is a minister and said that in his experience the Sunrise facility in his (very small) town is not so great ""they nickel and dime you to death"".  However it's ten minutes away from where I live.  What are others' experiences of Sunrise--do they vary much from place to place?        Also any other thoughts you have on my dilemma are very welcome.   I am nonstop worrying about this decision.",False,Turtlewalk,2012-11-22,18.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493880,,,AlzConnected,,,

Tha is happening more and more....sometimes it causes me to use the wrong words in a sentence. The truth be known I even forget my spouse's name at times in a coversation. Sometimes it is hard to follow a conversation because the words run together and I can't seperate them out. I use to have a set of hearing aids which helped but I lost one of them so I don't wear any now. The cost is so high that I can't afford a new one. Living on SSI does't give much wiggle room especially with the cost of drugs. So thing now are a bit quieted now.     I know gentle reader I am getting off track so back to the party. there I sit. I have a wrist corsage on my left arm and it feels scratchy. I moved it because it got in the way and flipped around when I shook someones hand....sort of a pain so I moved it to the left wrist so it wouldn't get damaged.  Oh here comes the lady from down the street Mrs. what's her name. She lives in the big brick house with the white picket fences. Funny I can't remember her name. We shake hands and seeing the blank look on her face she tells me her name. Now i remember. He husband died from Alzeimer's last summer. so she understands what is happening to me.  The noise level in the house is getting to me. The man standing a few paces away shouts out  to some one across the room  and I  jumped in my seat startled by the sudden outburst. But that's what happens when you have this horrible desease. Many things can upset me like unexpected noise flashing lights darkness when a room goes dark. I thankful for the night-lights that come on at home so I can see and not panic by the sudden change.  For those of us that have Alzheimer's or/and other dementia dear reader the world is a frighting place. Any sudden change can create havoc for one with Alzheimer's.  For Alzhiemer's patients like me New Years can be a terrible night. All the talking partying loud noise and oh yes the fireworks...bombs bursting in air.  My gentle reader New Year's can be a lot of fun but for Alzheimer's patients it can be a living hell a battle ground of complete chaos. If i may gentle reader let me give you a few suggestions on handleing that night which comes once a year.  May I be bold enough to share with you some of the things that cause panic fear and temporary parallelizing of the person. Holiday times is the season for visiting and reconnecting with family and neighbors. Sometimes this season can be sad or stressful for those caring for a love one too.   Holidays can be meaningful for both the one with Alzheimer's and their caregiver and family. For Alzheimer's patients this link with the familiar past is reassuring and builds self-esteem. They see the family as something they helped to create.  one who is a caregiver needs to set limits early and be clear about them with others. Remember gentle reader you don't have to live up to the expections of friends or family relatives. Things are diffrent now.  Try to place your Alziemer love one i a quite are where he or she can be visited even if it is painful for the visiting person. Alzhimer's tends to bring a stigma and friends tend to stop visiting the love one with Alzheimer's.  Keeping the number of persons a s low as possible during visits. and it is good to have the visit in a seperate room where th patient feels safe and secure in familiar surroundings. Most Alsheimer's patients can put it together for brief periods and should have some time to rest in between visitors.  I try to keep my holidays plain and simple even though I am in the early stages of the dementia. Sudden change upsets me and I find myself confused fearful and loss. I try to take part in the preparations as it refreshes my memory of the past good times. It is fun time and brings old memories anticipation and helps me reminiscence.  Try to schedule activities especially early in the day to avoid fatigue as the added activities can wear a person out. For me gentle reader I also have COPD. So cold oudoor activities makes breathing hard for me. I do enjoy listen to music TV reading and cross stiching. At my daycare (respite) I enjoy doing stain glass creations and the familiar people I am with.  Avoid Light to Dark places this can throw me into fear and frozen panic.   I hope this has been helpful as there are over 5.4 million of us in this country with Alzheimer's and it's various forms of dementia. If you know someone with this horriable disease perhaps you can help the patient's caregiver by helping out like spending a few hours with the patient so the caregiver can do some personal things. That's why I go to daycare so Lisa my wife can get some space and private time just for her.   Another way to help out is to bring over a covered dish once in a while. A night off from cooking is a big help to  caregiver.  All these things help and for further information you can on your computer gentle reader look up  www.alz.org  for more ideas and information. If you don't have a computer there are some in the library you can use. or call 1-800-272-3900 there are experts to answer your questions and giving you ideas. Best of all they are available 7/24 all year long.  Well I got to go. It's been nice visiting with you. Have a wonderful day and ""Happy New Years! See you on the flip side of the calendar God willing. With much love to you gentle reader.

If wetell her not to go stay outside because it is 0 degree outside then she willsay that it's because we are afraid that she will die (from the cold). Once Itold her that since she wants to go stay at my brother's place then I will askhim to come pick her up. One day later she told me that I am kicking her outof our house. It's like she believes the worst of our good intentions. She andI have had our share of misunderstandings in the past when she was stillhealthy but not to this extreme.   Back then we were like best friends.  Now it seems like I barely know her.          Eversince she had been diagnosed with dementia we had been doing the best that wecan to take care of her.  And we do our best to keep her safe by telling her what to do and whatnot to do. However her behaviors are really pushing the limits. I don't knowwhat else I can do for her. She told me that she doesn't want to live with meanymore. If she has to live with me then she will run away. I believe this isbecause she doesn’t want to listen to us and only wants do what she wants to doeven though it’s not safe. It’s really hard to reason with her.                 I’m really stressed out and confused; I don’t know what to do.

Just still in shock it has come so suddenly.            Sunday night my house was full of almost all of mommas grandkids great grandkidscousins nieces her sister and me.  I was the youngest of 6 children 5 of us still living. She moved in with me in July this year but lived just a rocks throw from my house for the last 9 years.  Even though I was her only child who was with her I am so glad. No regrets about anything except wish we would have had more time together.  I was with her even though it was very difficult watching her and holding her hand as she took her last breath.       The grandkids wanted to sing momma a song and that is what we did.  I would like to share it with you as it is a beautiful song full of hope and one of my mommas favorites.  Only moments after singing it to her her eyes filled with tears and ran down her beautiful cheeks then finally she let go and took her last breath. This is the song:                                          Life Without End-At Last                                                  (John3:16)      ""Can you see with your mind's eye Peoples dwelling together? Sorrow has passed. Peace at last!   Life without tears or pain.  Sing out with joy of heart!  You too can have a part. Live for the day when you'll say ""Life without end at last!""        In those days old will grow young Flesh revived as in childhood. Troubles are gone from now on No need to weep or fear. Sing out with joy of heart!  You too can have a part. Live for the day when you'll say ""Life without end at last!""        Paradise all will enjoy As we sing of God's glory.  Long as we live we will give to God our Maker thanks.        Sing out with joy of heart! You too can have a part. Live for the day when you'll say ""Life without end at last!"" ""             (This is a beautiful song and if you would like to listen to the melody that goes with these words you can go to JW.org and type in the title of the song and it will bring it up. It's on utube as well.)           I already miss her and feel an empty place in my life.  I know I will see her again but never takes away the sadness now.  A few words that descibed my mom:  loving loyal faithful wise devoted strong spiritual forgiving compationate and oh so many more.            I am so thankful she is no longer suffering and trapped within her mind.  I will be ok as I told her and I will carry on with my life. I am thankful for the spiritual inheritance she gave me and will continue to share this with as many as I can.  I know she is only sleeping in death awaiting to be awaken to life in a paradise on earth with no more pain or suffering or sickness nor death.      Revelation 21:34 'and death will be no more'     Acts 24:15 'I have hope...resurrection of both the                       righteous and the unrighteous'     Ecclesiastes 9:5  'dead are conscious of nothing at all'     John 11:11 'awaken him from sleep'           These are only a few of the verses I love and appreciate.  Just wanted to share them with the loving and caring people that have traveled on this exhausting and bumpy road that has finally come to its end only waiting to begin a new one.           Sincerely with my deepest sympathy and gratitude to you all     Silentlove",False,silentlove,2012-09-06,106.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493724,,,AlzConnected,,,

1391,6210bfe97b65de9a5b680c75,2147493441,2012-11-20 15:52:00,Assisted Living Experience,"I just want to put out my own experience with putting Mom in Assisted Living. She's in a place that has independent living assisted living and memory care. Mom is in the Assisted Living portion where for more fees more care can be added such as help with bathing dressing etc. Mom bathes and dresses herself and gets around with a walker. Back in July after refusing to move saying she didn't need help there was nothing wrong with her etc  she finally agreed to the ALF. She immediately made new friends and got reacquained with people she had known years before. The activities were perfect and she was being cared for--meals housekeeping transportation all of her ADL's were being taken care of. The fact that she would maintain her independence and have her own apartment was the selling point for her and we jumped at it.  She was not able to live alone and for the money I was looking at putting out for in-home care which I knew Mom would not like anyway it looked like Assisted Living was the best option.  It has been good for her emotionally and socially. Mom still had issues especially asking for her things over and over but that's passed and she has totally settled it.           Fast forward to now. Mom's feet and ankles are severely swollen and the ALF ""lost"" her metformin prescription. This was discovered by the cardiologist I had to take Mom to because of a possible heart condition. He was reviewing her meds and I said something about the metformin. He did not see it on the list of meds provided by the ALF and I had to meet with staff and call Mom's primary doctor to straighten things out. Mom has gained about 15 pounds which the ALF director and the cardiologist said was normal after a person moves to an ALF. I suppose it's a bit like the ""Freshman Fifteen"" that many new college students experience.       Prior to moving to the ALF she never had a heart problem. She may not have one now; lab tests revealed possible congestive heart failure but the ekg came back fine. We won't know anything until she has  an echocardiogram. The cardiologist said he has seen a great deal of situations where the person's sodium is too high causing much of the problem that Mom is experiencing. She has no chest pain no other symptoms other than high blood pressure which is of concern.        Mom is not being assisted in following her diabetic diet or her low-sodium diet. Even though the doctor has faxed the orders multiptle times and I have had conferences with everyone from the administrator to the nurses to the med aids the message is not getting through. Even when the kitchen gets the message and provides healthier food this doesn't last long and they have to be told again. In addition the activity director takes the residents out for shopping and they stop for rich desserts like hot fudge sundaes mocha drinks brownies etc.  Mom does not have the wherewithal to say ""I can't have this"" and the right hand has not told the left hand what's going on.        Mom had an ear infection a few weeks ago and had a round of antibiotics. Ever since then she has complained of intermittent ear pain and draining. The nurse at the ALF said she has not seen any draining. After getting some attention Mom drops the subject so I have not pursued further treatment for her ear. This morning she called me to say that the ALF nurse had told her to put rubbing alcohol in her ear to stop the draining. I asked if her ear was draining and Mom then acted confused and said ""Yes well No well there's water in it."" I told her NOT to put alcohol in her ear and promptly made her an appointment for this afternoon. This is not the first time this has happened. A few weeks ago ""the nurse"" told her to drink vinegar and I had to deal with that. I don't know if there is some staff member who mom calls ""the nurse"" that is actually telling her these things or if Mom is telling me that the nurse recommended it because she thinks I'll approve of it that way.        Mom is mobile with a walker. I've seen her time and again leave her walker and walk on uneven surfaces nearly falling many times. It's often dark and stormy here; many times Mom will leave her walker next to my car walk up to the curb in the rain and wind and try to step up on the curb by herself. If she is doing this with me she is doubtless doing this at the ALF. Yesterday I saw the activity director unload at least half a dozen walkers from the bus at WalMart and there were wheelchairs lowered on the lift. The outings include only the activity director and maybe one other staff member. How can she keep track of so many walkers and keep the residents from doing something silly like walk off without their walkers? I won't even go into the spending and shopping trips because I already did that on another thread.           Right now I feel like I have to weigh Mom's happiness against her health. I am going to tour a nursing facility in our area next week. I am also going to discuss with the director the possibility of transitioning Mom to the Memory Care Unit.  Mom knows what that is and is terrified of the place. In either case  moving Mom when she's so happy where she is could be traumatic and cause her to go downhill. If I leave her where she is her health will continue to suffer and she'll go downhill anyway. She has already declined mentally in the past month. I guess the question is not whether to move her but when and why.Just having her leave her apartment for another one within the same building will be traumatic. I know Mom will succomb to her disease eventually but I don't want to be guilty of speeding that up because of my lack of information or because of neglect.   For those considering an ALF even one with staff trained in dementia care please think carefully and explore all options. I wish I could find someplace with a more holistic approach but I don't know if a place like that exists.   I know the ALF seems to bridge the gap between independent living and a nursing home but I wonder if it's a rather shaky bridge. I'd hoped that Mom would be able to stay on where she is for a year or two but I doubt if that's the case. I know every place has its problems and no place is perfect. I did what I needed to do at the time and it has worked for a while. I don't go in for fortune telling and all of that but if this serves as a sort of crystal ball for others to look into I hope it's been useful. Maybe it's just a longwinded rant. If so I feel better.   Thanks for reading.",False,dutiful deb,2012-01-01,1899.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493441,,,AlzConnected,,,

She has had several falls that have resulted in ER visits.  One fall resulted in a hospital stay for 48 hrs of   observation.     I was awarded Limited Guardianship in August.  I received full Guardianship on November 8 2012. At the hearing it was stated that she has severe dementia. Within the past 8 days Mom has fallen 3 times.  The first time we were at the ER for 9 hrs. Extensive x-rays were taken of her right side as well as a CT scan.  They said there weren't any fractures.  The neurology resident in the ER after reveiwing her chart told me I needed to have her transferred to another nursing home or she wouldn't last long. It was later discovered that she had a fractured collerbone on her left side. Because she didn't complain of pain at the ER they didn't x-ray that side of her body.  Within 72 hrs she fell again and was sent to the ER.  This time it was to the hospital close to the nursing home. After xrays the ER doctor told me she had a concussion and a possible fracture in her C5 vertebrae.  When I received the call from the NH I was told that they had an aide sitting outside her room but the aide couldn't get to her in time.  Mom had gotten up to use the bathroom. When I brought Mom back to the NH an employee told me the bed alarm was on. While enroute to the nursing home today I received a call from the nursing home.  She had falled while in the activities room and injured her hip.  They had called for the portable x-ray machine to brought to the NH.  They had her in a wheelchair.     I have already begun the search for a facility with dementia care ward.     Does anyone have any suggestions?,False,sdf,2011-12-14,11.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493489,,,AlzConnected,,,

We knew my mother was getting more and more forgetful but didn't realize how big an issue it was until last year when I received a phone call from the local police. My mother was at a local store attempting to send a wire transfer for a large amount of money to Jamaica and she had been in previously and sent some funds and they knew she was being scammed. So bless their hearts they called the police to come to the store to talk to my mother. It turns out she had sent $10000 and did not remember sending any of it. This led to us realizing how bad off she was and long story short we moved her into an assisted living facility. I have four siblings but am the local one so her care is left to me as far as taking her to dr finances and making sure she gets out to be with family. I am fine with this arrangement but have to be honest that it is wearing me out. I am the one getting phone calls that people are stealing from her...the latest call was someone stole her calendar. I am the one getting the calls saying she has to go to dr for this ache and this pain. Again I am exhausted but can handle it. I wish I could say that I at least receive phone calls of appreciation and support from my siblings but I don't. The thing that send me over the emotional edge this morning was reading a facebook post from my one sister in law to my brother saying that she was thankful for HIM and loved my brother and his wife. Am I overreacting that it would have been nice for ANY of my brothers or sister to send me a post saying they appreciated what I was doing for our mother? I am not asking for pats on the back because I love my mother but the quirks of her disease sometimes get hard to deal with.

She told me that she reads the articles in the paper and talks with friends who have been through this.  She needs help with Dad's care and needs to hear that there are ways to do things that can help both of them.  At this stage Dad is perfectly content to sit in front of the tv and watch old movies all day while she goes out and plays bridge with friends.  She is frustrated in that when she invites people over to the house for dinner Dad gets made and nasty.  I've tried to tell her that he can't handle the discussion and too many people in the house at once.  A few people within a short amount of time is what is suggested.  Of course she feels that her life is being taken away because of this.  How can I get her to see that going to a support meeting or talking with someone from the Alzheimers association would help her and its ok to ask for help.  My brothers have also tried to talk with her about going but she won't do it.   That would make all of this real and is hard to handle.

From time to time we are seeing a secretion of some kind coming from the vagina that looks like a thick brownish-yellow snot.  We can't tell exactly where it's coming from so it may be from the bladder or the uterus.  It has practically no smell.  What could it be?  She does have a history of UTIs ever since she started wearing diapers years ago.  She was put on Cipro for one starting 3 weeks ago.  2 weeks ago we switched to a small dose of a different antibiotic for maintenance.  It's possible that it's still a UTI but she has been on antibiotics for 3 weeks and she typically responds to them well.  It doesn't cause her any pain and she never complains.  She's still somewhat verbal and will tell us when something hurts so I know she's comfortable.  Regardless this is a new development and I don't know what it is.

She was his care-taker who did not revealto us that he had dementia (nor did she tell us that she had cancer – it was asudden death).  We’ve been on top of the legal stuff (POA elder lawyerfinances etc…) but it’s been very difficult on my BIL.  Recently my FIL fell down a flight ofstairs but did not break any bones – just a bunch of bruises &amp; cutforehead.  He did however have to go tothe hospital 2 times the 2nd lasting several days because he couldnot handle the pain a few days later. His driving has also been questionable (he just drives locally).  We are considering moving his upstairsbedroom to the 1st floor but this would be a dramatic change forhim and he would put up a fight against this. It would benefit him if he had his bedroom on the first floor (both hipswere replaced 15 yrs ago and does have respiratory problems).   He is a 2 hr drive from us so my wife &amp;I can only help my BIL on weekends for the most part.  What do we do if Dad rants &amp; raves yells&amp; screams to prevent us from moving his bedroom?  Do we just go ahead &amp; do it?  Should we wait &amp; risk him fallingagain?  He is a retired mechanic aperson who always does things his way and is very stubborn.  A physical therapist (appointed from socialworker at hospital) did evaluate him recently &amp; said he’s OK to use thestairs.  We are very skeptical aboutthis though.     Does anyone have anysuggestions or stories related to this they can share?,False,DaveObiWan,2012-08-26,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493639,,,AlzConnected,,,

He is in a wheelchair but uses a walker (with assitance only) to transfer to the toilet or to bed etc. The nurse thinks he was reaching for something near his bed yesterday when he fell. He was found on the floor near his bed and nightstand. He was probably reaching for the call button so he could be toileted.      Fast forward to today about 24 hours later I get another call from the nurse saying he fell again almost same scenario although this time I think they found him sooner because they heard his chair alarm go off.      They've checked him all over asked him if he has any pain and are checking him for a UTI (this is unusual behavior for him plus he seems extra confused).     PT added some anti-tipping devices to his chair although his chair didn't tip when he fell he stood up on his own and was trying to reach something.     In a way I hope he does have a UTI because that would explain the behavior and it could be treated.      If it's just more progression of the AD symptoms it's just such an incredible bummer. Things just seem to be happening faster and faster.     The only other things I can think of as to why these falls happened: the first fall was on a Sunday when he had a different-than-usual aide next day same thing he had a different aide. He has been diagnosed with OAB (overactive bladder and bph/enlarged prostate) so he has to go frequently. His usual aides understand this but anyone new might not be privy to this information. He may have been trying to press the call button or even reach for his night time hand-held urinal.      I've asked them to wrap the call button in something bright so that there's more contrast between it and the bedspread. I keep trying to think of other things that could help...     Also his roommate keeps getting up and toileting himself (he's not supposed to) and maybe my Dad is thinking well if he can do it why can't I?     One of my Dad's aides theorized that he's getting stronger so he thinks he can do things on his own but I think he's actually deteriorating/having more AD symptoms. He just seems so much more confused lately.      The falls are new to me so any advice would be appreciated. Two in two days is so nerve wracking.

I’m always afraid she will fall on the wet floor.    If I have to resort to baby gates I will but I’d rather not we already feel like we live in a prison with pretty much every single door in the house with a keyed deadbolt.    Also if anyone knows how to keep her from picking at her cast. She has already pulled out most of the inside fluffing they wrap around the arm first.    Even before this the aide had suggested “footy pajamas” like a giant adult onesie because she kept taking her diapers off.    They put them on backwards so they can’t get them off and therefore cant get the diaper off.    We got one the other day hoping it would work for the cast and it did for about two seconds.    She had a loop of the fluff out last night and was trying to stick her foot through it to use as leverage to pull the rest out and I had to run and get the scissors and cut the fluff off so she couldn’t do it…ugh!!!,False,karohari,2012-02-19,14.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493308,,,AlzConnected,,,

Her vocabulary is all gone and she just mumbles incoherently.  I noticed that when I made momma smile tonite that her smile is crooked a little like the left side of her mouth smiled but the right side stayed relaxed. But when I go to put her dentures back in she can purse her lips and it would take a crowbar to open her mouth (not that I would do that of course). But that lets me know that he still has muscle control of her entire lip muscles when need be.  But I don't want to confuse the issue of the JERKS by adding other symptoms that I think might be related to assist in a diagnosis.

Overall things are just fine with mom but I find a few things are disappointing in the new place and I'm also missing some of the staff from the old place.      So concern number one- Weight gain!  Mom moved into new NH 3 weeks ago weighing 112 and now weighs 116.  She's gained 4 pounds!  She's less than 5 feet tall and really doesn't need to gain weight.  Their food is delicious but there is less focus on healthier options than the old place. Here they can get dessert at lunch and dinner and push around dessert carts.  She's also on a medication that might be contributing to the weight gain but I doubt it would have happened so rapidly as she was on it for 2 months prior with only a 2 pound gain prior.      And her left ankle is swollen. I noticed it last week when they brought her back from the shower. She still had her shoes on but it was noticebly puffy. It was the first time I had seen her ankle. No bruising but the aide said something about her hitting it getting in or out of bed and said the nurse checked it and it looked okay. She's walking on it fine and not complaining of pain but a week later it's still puffy. I mentioned it to her main day shift nurse and he knew nothing about it and was upset on her behalf. He looked at it and was trying to understand why no one had told him or passed it on! At least he's attentive. He also thought the weight gain might because of the ankle edema but it's not that huge. He was also peeved with her aide because she was supposed to reweigh mom and hadn't so he had her do it that's when we found the weight increase.     He said he will look at the ankle this morning before she gets out of bed to see it the swelling gets worse with shoe off or not. He thought her shoes and ted hose were probably controlling it. He also mentioned that sometimes its a sign of congestive heart issues and I filled him in more on mom's background she only had one issue with this coupled with pnemonia but it cleared.      I'm also tempted to say something to dietary about her weight gain.  I don't want my mother to get fat.  On another anti psychotic Zyprexa she got up to 130 pounds! She's been under 117 for almost a year so I hate to see her weight go up. She ended up getting high blood pressure when her weight was that high..     Lastly it's been over 3 weeks and I was told that after a few weeks we would have a care conference but i've yet to speak to the social worker. Though I've seen her in the halls a few times when I've visited mom she's not once stopped to check in with me about how she is doing while other staff have. So that's a bit annoying.  I mentioned something to the Activities Director about the care conference yesterday and she said she was surprised that they hadn't talked to us yet. Hmmm. Will give it one more day but then am going to call.        p.s. Gosh I just really miss some of her old aides some were very young and sweet.  The aides here are kind and take their time with her but there's not that long term relationship that she had with some at her old place.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493274,,,AlzConnected,,,

When does it actually sink in that this is who my mother is now?  I still am having a difficult time with putting a label on her.  Her first diagnosis came over 2 years ago.  Mama was forgetting things and having a hard time finding the right words to say.  The neurologist diagnosed her with Primary Progressive Aphasia.  He explained that this is the early signs of dementia and that there was no cure.  He made suggestions to her to be creative and artistic. My mom was always so active and involved in so many things.  I didn't realize the significance of this diagnosis until much later on.  Mom moved in with me that year and I set up a nice room for her in my house.  She took up coloring and would pass the day away watching Turner Classic Movies and coloring non-stop through out the day. She seemed content and happy. Three months later she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  She was 80 years old.  How could this be happening?  We opted to have the surgery and she had a full mastectomy of her right breast.  I became her caregiver at this time and I nursed her back to health.  Life went on.  I started noticing other signs besides the memory issues and trouble finding words and discussed all of these with her primary doctor.  The biggest change was a significant weight loss. He did some blood tests and discovered a B12 deficiency. Everything seemed to be treatable. For the most part she was fairly independent.  Dressed herself fed herself and stayed fairly clean. My mom always had a fear of water.  She rarely would shower but would sponge bathe herself.  She loved her weekly visits to the hair salon and I would drive her around wherever she needed to go.  She gave up driving that year because she had gotten lost one night and couldn't find her way home. She was also starting to have little mishaps and fender benders.I was concerned for her safety so luckily giving up driving was not an issue. We were able to spend some quality time together.  Shopping or going out to lunch was one of our favorite things to do. Life went on and her one year check-up showed that she was cancer-free!   In December of last year she was playing around with my son and took a fall in the kitchen. She was in a lot of pain so my husband called 911 and she was taken to the emergency room.  She ended up with a compression fracture to her spine.  I think this is when things started to take a turn for the worse. After spending over 4 hours in the ER she was finally admitted for further observation. After she was settled in her room my husband and I went home to try and get some sleep.  We were called in the early morning that my mom was highly agitated and was very confused.  They let me talk to her on the phone and she didn't recognize my voice and wanted to know why she was being held in the hospital.  We rushed back to the hospital and found my mom in a chair in her room.  She had actually climbed out of bed with the fractured back trying to get out of the hospital.  I later found out from one of the doctors that she had experienced ""sun-downers""... and they thought she may be suffering from Parkinson's Disease and dementia.  My head was spinning..everything was happening so fast.  She was moved to a nursing home for physical therapy while her back was healing.  She stayed there for 6 weeks.  While there she was started on Aricept and she experienced more sun-downers episodes but seemed to be physically getting her strength back. I rearranged my home and made a bedroom on the first floor for her return home and care. Steps seemed to be out of the question now and she was at a high risk for falling.  Her shakiness would come and go but she was never diagnosed with the Parkinson's.  I was able to bring her home and she continued therapy at home for another 6 weeks.  Time went by and she seemed to be gaining more strength. During the summer months of this year she woke up in the middle of the night screaming for me...She told me that she couldn't move her legs. She was mumbling and not making any sense. She was scared trembling and I actually thought she was having a stroke.  After talking with her I calmed her down and showed her that she could in fact move her legs. I think she may have been dreaming.  She has suffered from depression and anxiety all her life so I gave her some anxiety medication and she seemed much better and went back to sleep. The next day I talked with her doctor and he suggested that I speak with the neurologist again. He explained that it was very doubtful that she had a stroke because she would not have been able to call out for me and that stroke usually effects one side of the body not both limbs. Soon after that episode the trembling started to get severe.  The Dr. started her on a medication for Parkinson's. Things started to return to some kind of normalcy for awhile. I think she really went in to a deep depression after this.  She was sleeping all the time. She wouldn't even watch her old movies. Her focus seemed to be gone.  She wouldn't read or even engage in family get togethers. She started to be incontinent at night and the sun-downers returned.  She almost became child-like.  Talking in a strange little girl voice.  Quite disturbing at times.  My children were afraid at times and worried for me.  I was exhausted all the time trying to figure out what I could possibly do to make her happy.  She became totally dependent on me for all of her needs. Helping her dressbatheeat toiletwalktalk..it was killing me to see what was happening to my mother.  What happened to change her so drastically?  Her therapist started coming to the house for visits.  She would talk with him and tell him all of her fears.  He would tell me that she seems ""with it"" and to keep doing a good job.  Why couldn't he see what I see?  My extended family didn't know what was happening either except for what I was telling them.  They didn't experience what I was living with.  She would actually almost seem normal when they would come for visits.  I started thinking was she making believe for attention?  Crazy thoughts would go through my mind.  I would become agitated with her and try to rationalize what was happening.  I know now that she didn't have that ability to manipulate me.  It was all part of this dreadful disease. I am taking one day at a time now. I never know what to expect.  One moment my mama is there and we are talking and the next moment she is gone and mumbling not making any sense.  She has become more flexible and moving around better with the aid of her walker.  I can hear her at night sometimes wandering or trying to use the bathroom herself.  She usually will scream out for me in the night if she needs help her wakes up scared and feeling alone.  My heart goes out to her.  She must feel so lost. I have learned a lot over these past 2 years and I am currently trying to educate myself about this disease and I have a nurse that comes in once a week to give me a break. After reading so many stories on this forum already I know I have found the right place for information support and a place where I can just vent without being judged or criticized.   There is so much more that I have to learn but one day at a time is all I have. I miss my mom and how we use to be. I pray for guidance and a cure for this disease that has taken the strongest woman I know away from me.   Thanks for letting me share a little piece of my story.",False,jeanie913,2012-11-03,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147493337,,,AlzConnected,,,

Since I have six years left on my existing note at 5% I bit.           I filled in all the papers and sent them all in a couple of weeks ago. Today I was informed that even though the home is in my name alone they would require that my wife would have to sign the papers for the new loan. The fact that I have personal resources in my name and the value of the home is over five times the loan amount even so she would still have to sign since she is my wife.            A little known Tennessee law that states that the only way to get around this provision is if I am her legally appointed guardian or if the durable power of attorney I have was signed by her before she was diagnosed with alzheimers. And I would have to provide documentation in the form of a doctor's statement of diagnosis showing the date as before the DPA.           Even though I tried to educate the loan officer about alzheimer's disease her hands are tied by the law and the loan company's board. I asked her to send my papers back and forget the whole thing. It won't hurt me because it was going to be simply a way to reduce my payments and give me more money that I will probably have to spend down anyway.           I take this as a sign of further proof that as a recent comedian says in some of his routines ""You can't cure stupid"".

I consider myself fortunate to get an appointment that soon from what I have read of others' experiences.   His geriatric doc does the mini-test once or twice a year but I have seen a significant cognitive decline over the past few months. Mike takes 20+ meds for a multitude of health issues and is on hospice now for cardiac condition. He messes up some meds because of the MCI which I am told could be vascular dementia. I reached the point where I just could not stand to see one more pill on the floor missed when he dispensed his meds.  I am so nervous as he needs to give up driving. At 72 he is young to be facing that loss just another in a long line of losses over the past 7 years. But I am afraid when driving with him his perception is just ""off."" I cannot take the risk of an auto accident resulting in his death or that of another or even a lawsuit.   His other health conditions will probably claim Mike long before Alz or whatever it is can advance that far but the dementia is only adding to my concerns about him. Last week he fell stepping off a curb he did not see; the week before it was poor judgment about where he tried to dismount the riding mower (onto soft dirt next to a skinny tree and loose stones). That incident involved a trip to ER and the more recent one caused black eyes and facial swelling along with chest pain. Terrifying!  My husband is 10 years older than I am but I thought we would have much more time together. Now that he is on hospice it confirms my impression that his situation is dire.   My mother (93) had a few good days which were a blessing to me. I enjoyed her good humor and spritely attitude but it did not last. Now she is so tired again and so restless unable to get up but wanting to get to the bathroom constantly. Doesn't know what to do when there and is unproductive as well.  I stopped Mom's Namenda over the past few weeks as well as the Celexa (I never thought she was depressed but doc wanted to try it). I have Ativan cream for anxiety but for the most part that receded along with the hallucinations when the Namenda stopped. At this point why mess with her brain; it's already scrambled enough!  Living with two people who are 20 years apart yet both dying is such a burden sometimes. I have a great deal of faith and God carries me through everything but it does not mean I don't feel the pain. If Mom had Mike's cognitive abilities or he had her physical condition I could have a reasonably ""whole"" person.   I am blessed that both are generally easygoing reasonably compliant and usually do not argue with me or get disagreeable. My husband is much like my mother both people with a strong work ethic faith in their Lord never complain would do anything for anyone.  Now I must give them all I have so they will make a good report to the Lord when they get to Heaven.  Been a rough couple of weeks with a welcome respite but then really coming to terms with hubby's need for hospice etc. One day I will have neither of them here and the house will be clean lawn mowed phone calls returned immediately etc. For now I give them all I can and pray it is enough.  As always I appreciate everyone here on the message boards. We have a family of sorts and I know I always have somewhere to turn.  God bless you all!

Dad has finally been diagnosed with Cerebral Atrophy And I know he has dementia because I've lived with him for the past 20 years.It just seems so bizarre to me that none of the doctors will come out and say the word Alzheimer's even though the neurologist has him on the Exelon patch 9.5. I was talking to my veterinarian of all people and he said that medicare pays more for dementia than it does for the big ""A"" or some such thing...                    Anyway I am alone here with him and I am disabled also with a chronic pain condition bipolar disorder and multiple spine surgeries (failed and pending). Dad has delusions daily however so far he can care for his own cleanliness etc while I cook clean and do laundry drive dispense meds and try to convince him to take them and try to figure out daily how to deal with his anger and depression. My elder brother who is successful and well off albeit very busy with a franchise and a job as a supervisor with a big airline lives 500 miles away. He only recently has become aware of the severity of dad's condition because he thought I was exaggerating all the times before when I called for help. Finally one day last week Dad decided to walk 15 miles away to a pool hall we frequent at times while I was in another town at a doctor's appointment.I called Eric(brother) on my dying cell phone to ask him to please convince my feeble 85 year old dad not to embark on said journey. Now he believes Dad has a problem and also seeing the physical report from the neurologist.                   My problem is this: I don't know how to handle Dad's angry and verbally abusive outbursts they frighten me. I desperately want to keep him out of a nursing home for financial reasons-but because he's my Daddy...                     Also What do I do if he decides to set out n a physically impossible journey that will endanger him? I am his Health care Surrogate. Will they take him away from me if I call for help like to the police?                      And who do I turn to for answers to these questions? A physical person or place that wouldn't be too far away so I wouldn't feel so afraid and alone all the time? This is such a confusing and heartbreaking illness.

Dad and I both felt though we didn't talk about it that it was that way again and tried to soothe her through it.  It was really tough and horrible to hear her moaning in anguish we may have wondered if it was right to hold off.  Mom was distressed calling us names and crying we were letting her die and idiots for not calling the police or 911.  She was unable to move get up but after 20 minutes the pain was less constant and eventually got up and struggled to crawl and walk down the stairs.  By the time we were downstairs the pain was less present but she was intent on calling for help and tried to dial 911 but I blocked it and we kept trying to reassure her this had happened before and would pass (it seemed to be mostly over at this point but it was hard to rationalize except knowing from the previous experience).  So we were pretty much out of it I think when she grabbed the phone again and wasn't stopped before the 911 got out.  They ended up coming Mom was very stable by then - blood pressure we took had gone from 155/78 to 145/85 - but I guess the protocol is to send her to the hospital.  I was very frustrated by this because we'd gone through the difficult part and now that it was returning to normal she was off to the ER.  Dad rode along I stayed and waited for the call to come pick up.  This was a little after 3 I picked them up at 6:30.  She was fine a urine test was clear.  But we were all frazzled Mom was upset she'd been ""Bad."" It wasn't until dinner that we were OK though both Mom &amp; Dad were exhausted.""     She was always a stoic Mom last one to complain of anything so it's been a huge change to see her like this when she's asking to go to the hospital or call 911.      I'd be interested to know if others have experienced something like this and what has helped them.  Thanks so much.     Diane",False,DaughterDi,2012-08-27,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492034,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mom has some memory problems she is Diebetic high bloodpreasure had a stroke in 2004 she has austio arthritus and her knees are really bad bone on bone rubbing when she walks I was told she needs knee replacement sergery and will need months of rehab to get them working afterwords. her arthritus Doc was giveing her shots that only gave her relief for about 2 weeks then the pain would return one day he just up and moved out of his office with out giving anyone notice or referal to another doc. so we have been relying on her primary care doc to perscrib her pain med I have asked for a referal for a new athritus doc but he has not given us one . she was taking tramadol 50 mil she was supose to take 1 1/2 every 8 hours but I found out she was taking 2 because 1 1/2 was not helping I told her doc about it and he upped her perscription to 100 mil 1 tab every 8 hour but now the insurance is giving us a hard time and says they only will pay for 30 pills in 30 day but are only giving her 10 pills at a time and it costs her 25.00 every ten days to get it filled. Her doc wants to put her on a pain patch that would need to be changed every three days or she could go through sevier withdrawls  when I went to the pharmacy to fill the new perscription they do not have it in stock and would have to order it I asked why they dont carry it she said they were not sure but thought it was because it was such a strong medication that the patient could die from it if not taken right ( omg) now what do I do. I live in Florida My sister lives in Az and my brother lives in Minnesota. I called my sister upset because I was not sure what I should do about mom and her pain and the medication they want to put her on that patch all I got from her was a lecture on how I need to talk for mom with her doctor cause mom wont I said what do you think I have been doing I have been fighting with this for the past 3 months well she went on and on about how medicating the pain was not the answer that she should have the sergery and went on so much she managed to make me feel bad about the care I was not giving her. keep in mind after my dad died in 2000 no one wanted to take care of mom but me. mom wants to live in her own home we have 5 acres and put a tralor on our property for her to live in because when she had a place I was there everyday checking on her so we desided it would be better to have her close by and yet have a place of her own. So I asked my sister if mom had the sergery if she would come help with her recovery she said she would until I told her it would take about 6 months of rehab and making sure she did her excersises and taking to and from theropy and everything else that  goes with it. Finally she told me I should think about putting mom in an assisted living home. Guess she does not want to deal with it except to critisize me on what a bad job I do. My brother is no help when I told him my husband had AD and that I may need help with the care of mom he said she could come stay with him for a short piriod of time but not perminetly I gave up on him.  So what do I do put her in a assited living home get her the knee replacement sergery she needs in both kneesget the patch not get the patch find a new doctor ? she does not get along verywell with my sister and does not want to move to Az. she would rather go home to Min but I dont think my brother will care for her the way she needs and his wife think she would be a berdon to themI feel. I told my sister I am having a hard time with this because I have my hands full with my AD husband and am afraid can no longer care for mom the way she needs. her reply was I dont know what to tell you ( thanks a lot) she was no help anyway could use some advice on this one,False,pearlnme,2012-08-24,86.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492597,,,AlzConnected,,,

My parents and brothers live in California.  I am making plans to move back home to help with the care of my dad.  My mom needs me more now then ever and I need to be there with her through this.  She isn't in the best health herself and has been in a low place with the recent deaths of her sister in December 2011 and her baby brother in July 2012.  On top of that she has been the sole caregiver for my grandma who is in her 80's.  My brothers live about 90 minutes away from my parents.  They were helpful during the initial few weeks of my dad ""losing it"" but have since backed away leaving things in my moms lap.  I know they are both trying to cope and accept the inevitable. They live far and still have their own life and family to care for.  While I do understand that I disagree that this is my mom's problem.  In the next few months I will be uprooting my 13 year old daughter and leaving behind my older children and a wonderful man who I love dearly. He has decided that he doesn't want to move with us.  I know he is also trying to cope with all that is going on. He hasn't been very supportive during this ordeal and I know that him deciding to stay behind is for the best.  I am very sad to be giving up my relationship I finally found a man that I could see as a partner for life and I was the happiest I've been since my divorce years ago.  My parents need me now and if it wasn't for this reason I would never give him up.  So the plan is I have no plan other than I am moving back home. I will look for a job and a place to live near my parents.  The focus now...getting rid of furniture and personal possessions.      My dad has yet to be diagnosed we are working on that now.  He has a strong family history as my grandpa passed from AD and my uncle is in the final days of AD.  I'm no doctor but I'm about 95% certain that my dad's diagnosis will be AD.  How do families survive this terrible tragedy?  I have already in just a few weeks felt unbelievable sadness for the loss of my father as I have always known him guilt for not being able to be there sorrow for my brothers who are dealing with their own emotions disbelief that this is happening more guilt for hiding keys and lying to my dad in order to keep him safe. Most of all I fear for my mom's health and even for her safety if my dad should  ""lose it"" again. I feel and hear the stress pain shock fear guilt and sorrow in my moms voice everyday and I just can't take that.    Add reply  Quote    Report Post",False,Nora,2012-01-23,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492689,,,AlzConnected,,,

He does not want her in hospital nursing home and does not want hospice. I know this is very hard for you watching her go this way and I must beg you to have him talk with a hospice intake evaluator.  You can get someone from any hospice you choose to come speak with your grandfather and the family members about what they can do for your grandmother. If he wants her to pass at home then they will make it possible for you.   I know she is not at risk for falls now that she does not get out of bed and sleeps at floor level. Most likely no one would have to call EMTs or ambulance but even if someone did your grandfather has the right to refuse to have her taken away! Hospice will support that right and will come to her home to aid the family in various ways as well as to make sure your grandmother is as comfortable as possible and not in pain.  This is such a valuable service funded by Medicare and she is entitled to it as is the whole family. No one will take her away from him and his wishes will be followed.   All you need to do is call hospice agencies and they will take it from there even contacting the doctor. If he does not like the service he can cancel at any time. But I believe once you get the caring compassionate help of hospice workers you will know it was the best decision for all involved.  God bless you all! Please let us know how she is doing and how you are coping.,False,Nora,2012-01-23,2270.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492702,,,AlzConnected,,,

They did the first but not the latter two. Nightmare followed by the nightmare of her PCP (""Old Doctor"") strong-arming me into withdrawing complaints against his colleagues.     Since then her behaviors have worsened: Wandering; eating stuff like uncooked macaroni raw meat sticks of margarine; never sleeping. Her confusion is worse her delusions are worse her OCD is worse.     Found New Doctors locally (Ventura County) who came highly recommended and who turn out to have a lot of clout out here. The senior physician in the practice cut his teeth running a skilled nursing facility a long time ago (he’s a couple of years older than I) and he specializes in geriatric care. Mama has mainly been seen by his younger associate who has been very caring.      NEW ISSUE - URGENT (to me at least):      We’re trying to figure out a way to get her into skilled nursing so she is SAFE but if possible not just room and board but with physical therapy. That would give me 3 – 4 weeks to find a long-term solution but where she is SAFE while I am doing so. A local skilled nursing facility told me that if New Doctors order Mama to be admitted they would give her a Medi-Cal bed simply out of respect for New Doctors but it would be without PT absent three days in the hospital first due to Medicare rules.     Talked to the new doctor and she said the problem she faces is that Mama cannot be admitted to hospital for PHYSICAL reasons because MRIs and other tests associated with her back pain could be handled out-patient so Medicare would not approve admitting for those reasons. And Ventura County has no gero-psych wards period not anywhere anyhow. She  does  need hospitalization for gero-psych reasons (her delusions and hallucinations are increasingly scary) but New Doctors don’t have admitting privileges in Los Angeles County.     So I contacted Mama’s old doctor in Burbank explained the situation. He had already advised me that effective 1/1/2013 he couldn’t accept straight Medi-Cal but needed LACo-based “Healthcare Partners” coverage to be able to keep seeing her. And in Ventura County we are Gold Coast Healthcare.     Instead of referring back to the August incident as reason for switching doctors I “blamed” it on the change in Medi-Cal process. And asked him to work with the new doctors to get Mama into the LACo gero-psych ward in Tarzana and coordinate with new doctors for her discharge into a local skilled nursing facility so I wouldn’t have to drive back and forth to Burbank. That email went to both Old Doctor and New Doctors.     Then I followed up with a private email to Old Doctor only stating that it was going only to him “out of respect for him” asking him to ensure that when Mama was admitted to a gero-psych ward he NOT ask the neurologist or psychiatrist who had “seen” her in August to be the consulting physicians while she was in gero-psych. I referred him to the fact that the neurologist referred to a non-existent MRI and the psychiatrist took her off her anti-psychotic when  psychosis  is her primary +1 dementia symptom. The psych’s medical report claimed he “observed no delusions” so he decided she was not delusional despite the fact that PSJMC physical therapy staff confirmed the delusions I had reported. They observed it firsthand.     Instead of responding with even an ounce of caring like “sorry to hear this about your mother” Old Doctor is now insisting that she will HAVE to be seen by that neurologist and psych person and he is horribly upset that we are changing doctors!     The appointment with Old Doctor to get her admitted to LACo gero-psych is scheduled for Monday October 29 – yes two days from now.     I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

The story is that my mom was diagnosed in June of 2012 with AD. We believe she was stage 4-5 at the time but seems to have advanced to stage 6.     She went into the hospital for a fall this week due to pain and at her own choice. At the hospital she became very disoriented suspicious and delusional. She calmed down after a day and went back to the Assisted Living facility where she has been since June as well. Unfortunately the suspicions continued and she was very concerned about what other people thought of her. The staff said she would accuse others of stealing or talking about her behind her back.    When I went in to review this with them she was very angry with me and called some of the workers ""tattle-tales."" It was so disconcerting to see her this way since she had never expressed this kind of behavior before. The AL facility asked that she be given a psych eval to see if we can manage this behavior.    I lied to her and told her we needed to go back to the hospital for her hip. After 24 hours (!) in the ER they transfered her to a Behavioral Health Unit. It's a psych ward with locked doors screaming residents and no entertainment (TVs and such). It's a terrible place and she hates it and hates me for it.     My mom is very mistrustful of anything psychiatric hates to take pills that make her feel drowsy and is pretty stubborn. My questions:    1. Any advice on managing communication with my mom? What do I tell her about the place she is in?  2. Ideas on what I could bring her while in the unit? She hates reading and magazines but without TV she has little distraction.  3. Do others have this kind of experience and have it be successfully managed by medication? I seem to have only read posts about negative reactions to meds.    I'm very concerned feel so guilty about this and am getting tired of the barrage of hate that comes out of her at times.",False,bachfan23,2012-07-16,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492738,,,AlzConnected,,,

For this I apologize because you offered me support and I haven't been here to do the same.      My FIL is doing fine. this morning I woke up to find him sucking on a chicken bouillon cube and saying ""salty."" I couldn't help but giggle a little at that.   Backing up three weeks: My nineteen year old daughter offered to watch my FIL so my husband and I could go out on a date and I could get out of the house for a while. I got him cleaned up and in his pajamas before we left so she didn't have to do it. Told her how to give him his medicine and what to feed him for supper. Everything went fine until it was time for him to go to bed. I started receiving texts every two minutes.   On top of this my husband posted on Facebook that we were out on a date for the first time in an eon. He immediately gets a message from is sister in NC who has nothing to do with her dad. ""Who's with dad? Is he OK? I have a right to know!!"" I wanted to call her right then and tell her ""Do you think I would leave your dad in irresponsible hands? Yes he's fine. What do you think gives you the right to know?? The last time you were in town for two weeks you came by and saw him for TWO hours said you'd be back and never showed up! Now you want to act like you care! Leave us alone and let me enjoy my time out of the house!!!"" I didn't of course but ever fiber of my being wanted to.  Needless to say our date was cut short. I did get a nice dinner and time alone with my husband. We had planned on going to the movies but the endless texts from my daughter not being able to get my FIL in the bed hailed us home. She did the best she could and I was grateful.  The following week was my husband's adopted sons' fall break. I also refer to them as my bonus sons'. They live four hours away on the other side of Nashville thanks to their Mother wanting to get away from family and one of them is her grandfather with Alzheimers. Too much drama I suppose. Anyway the youngest son has severe ADHD and other serious behavior problems. He needs constant supervision just like my FIL and there's only one of me. Don't get me wrong I love the boys. I just thought it quite thoughtless of their mother knowing that I take care of my FIL and my hands are full anyway then sending the boys here during the week when my husband is at work. The whole reason she sent them here was to spend time with him. The only time he got to spend with them was when he got off work at 5 until bedtime which was early because he had to work the next day and my daughter had school. I survived nerves mostly intact. Although while cleaning after the boys went home I did find an empty match book. The youngest had been at it again. He's already set one of our fields on fire and his therapist is leaning on the side of pyromania. I don't want to hurt the boys in any way but if he is a danger to anyone in this house especially my FIL I'm going to have to talk to my husband and seriously reconsider them coming here until his behavior problems are under control for the safety of everyone involved.  The week of my daughter's fall break she was sick the whole time. School starts back tomorrow and she's better. Not a fun way to spend time off though.  And now me. I have got to find time to go to a chiropractor. My SI joint pulled a good one last night. I have never felt such pain in my life. I got my FIL to his room and got his depends changed and put his pajamas on him because I knew I was going down. I text my husband who was in the basement to come help me down the steps. By the time I made it to the bed I was in a hot flash and shaking from pain that wrapped around from my back to my abdomen and down my right leg. It eventually subsided but today my abdomen feels like someone used it as a punching bag.   My little vent is over. Sorry it was so long. I hope all of you are doing well. I also hope things around here will calm down a little so I can get back to the message boards on a regular basis.

In the interview  “Original Teen Heartthrob David Cassidy and His Heartbreak”  by Carol Steinberg Cassidy had some interesting things to say about Alzheimer’s that really struck a chord with me.   “This has arguably been the most painful and gut-wrenching personal experience in my life.”    Gut-wrenching ? He’ll get no argument from me on that one. I can totally relate to this confession because I feel exactly the same way. I truly believe anyone who has watched a loved one succumb to Alzheimer’s is forever changed by the experience. It is “gut-wrenching” as David Cassidy so perfectly described.   “I think anyone who has had the experience that I have who has the opportunity to reach people to educate to be pro-active in realizing the depth of this problem realizes that we have just experienced the tip of the iceberg as far as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are concerned.”    Tip of the iceberg?  David Cassidy hits the nail right on the head once again explaining what is yet to come from the predicted Alzheimer’s epidemic due to aging baby boomers. The iceberg comparison adds a nice visual element to help people understand better. What we haven’t seen yet from Alzheimer’s is so much more frightening and devastating than what we’ve already encountered.   I’m sorry for the pain that David Cassidy has suffered as he continues to watch his mother progress through the stages of Alzheimer’s disease. I know that pain and the helplessness of that situation. Thank you David Cassidy for using your celebrity to bring more awareness to this monstrous disease and the reality of what is yet to come unless we act to find treatment and a cure.

Hi everyone.     My grandmother whom I am very close with was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease beginning of 2012.     Here is the story...  My grandmother is 69 years old. For quite a few years the doctor's were blaming her ""confusion"" and other symptoms on the medication she was taking. My grandmother is on a LOT of medication for a different disease she has (it's something myalgia that causes face pain but not fibro myalgia). They kept telling her and my grandfather it was her medication that was causing these symptoms. Then my grandmother started falling. So the doctor was convinced she had multiple sclerosis. She had to go through all of the tests including the spinal tap. Come to find out she didn't have MS. So in January 2012 my grandmother was diagnosed with ""early onset"" alzheimers. I was married in January 2012 and at my wedding she was pretty ""with it"". She had some issues with coming up with words but she was OK. As of today 9/25/12 my grandmother was just admitted to hospice as final state alzheimers. Does the above seem kind of strange to anyone or no? How can someone be diagnosed in 2012 then 9 months later be unable to move talk use the restroom etc. I will tell you that she had a UTI which the doctor said caused an irreversable downturn.     I don't know. I'm just trying to deal with this and understand how it wasn't diagnosed earlier.      They were supposed to come see us this week (we live about 4 hours away) to look for assisted living/memory care places and now it looks like we will be going to see them to say goodbye to my grandmother.",False,HBFLA,2012-09-26,5.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492121,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mom resided in So CA about 1 mile away from my sister.  I lived 500 miles away.  Sister mentioned a few times that something was wrong with mom's mind but I didnt live there so I didn't see what my sister saw not that I disbelieved my sister just that I wans't there to witness things.  Why my sister didnt take my mom to a doctor I will never understand.    In 07 i went to So Ca to take a look at mom's hernia as she complained of pain.  There had been several incidences when I had asked my sisa trip to the ER a welfare check and a referral to a dentist) and sister would not help literally.  Mom drove herself with chest pains to the ER in the dark during a stage when she likely already had alzheiner's she told me she was scared to drive alone in the dark.  I told my sister about the chest pains and mom's fear and she still would not accompany mom.  I was on the verge of calling 911 from No CA for mom but mom said she could drive.  I hated being 500 miles away with a useless sister and BIL.      Something was found but not a heart problem but rather a seriously pulled muscle.  The ER gave mom a prescription.  I learned after the fact all of this.  Since mom's AD was in place mom did not know there was a prescription so didn't fill it.  Sister never checked on mom post ER.  When I asked mom what the ER said mom replied nothing was wrong.  i asked mom to send me the ER paperwork.  When the paperwork arrived there it was the prescription.    Back to my point.  Sister accused me of sneaking into So CA and stealing mom's money so I brought mom to SF with me.  Sister told me to never contact her again  but I did so anyway 1 time as a last ditch effort.  My BIL got on the phone and told me to get to So CA and put his name and my sister's name on moms bank accounts. I had missed so much work due to being broadsided as a caregiver unexpecedly.I exained to him that  I couldn't come to so ca immediately but would do so sooon.  he hung up on me.      It's been 5 years.  They have never visited mom.  my sisters unfounded and inaccurate accusations tore what family we had apart.      Mom has been with me for 5 years...all of you know from experience the types of things both tangible and emotioal that I have gone through.     I refuse to have a funeral for mom that my sister and I attend together.  I need the support of loving caring individuals not my sister who I suspect would either cause some shit or...    when mom des i want my own private service/funeral or whatever one wants to call it.  Do I have that service here in no ca then carry the ashes to where mom is to be buried and let my sister to arrange whatever she wants at the cemetery?  I just dont know how to work this.  I want to see mom's ashes put into the ground and help fill the grave with dirt like we did for dad.  Mom will be added to dad's grave at the Riverside Nat'l Cemetery.  I will be keeping a pinch of ashes for myself that will be kept in a necklance.  an old Indian tradition is to keep a lock of hair from the loved one which I will also do.  I might even due a thumbie print.    I have never stopped my sister from visiting.  I have offered to help them find a hotel close to moms nursing home.  I have encouraged her to visit.  She had every opportunity to do so while I worked 8 hours a day; now that mom is in a NH sister could visit anytime.  Remember sister told me not to contact her again.      If sister wants a pinch of ashes she needs to pick out a urn/bnecklace etc now because when mom dies i am not going to sit around waiting for my sister to shop then send me what she purchased.  I am planning my moms death with a funeral home now so that I don't have to go through this at the time of death.    But back to handling a service/funeral without my sister.  The question of the day.  I need all the ideas you can muster.    Thanks for your patience.

However my mom was put on it a month ago 1 mg 2x a day and combined with 1 mg of Lexapro we're having a really good month so far. Her Namenda was also stopped as the drs didn't think it was doing much and at this point I have to agree. I only see a very very tiny bit more bit of short term memory loss. So       I pray the good days continue.  Mom had a terrible time when she was put on Seroquel for over a year and a half so I'm happy to be making this change.       I'm curious  to know how Abilify differs from Seroquel.  What side effects or successes have people had?     I may never know why the Seroquel didn't work for my mom or understand the real issue.   Still not sure if its just that Seroquel couldn't control symptoms past 5 months OR that mom developed side effects to it over time. Or that in combination with other meds she was on it was just not right. But after most everything else that was suspect was stopped ( Nuerontin for pain Keppra for seizures... and even blood pressure meds she didn't need)My mom still kept having a 5 month pattern which would start w mild hallucinations...and progress to anxiety tearfulenss delusions agitation and combativeness.med refusal.     So anything i can learn about Abilify will be helpful.  I'm most worried about hallucinations and delusions returning.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492241,,,AlzConnected,,,

And of the September 24 conference I had with the Director of Nursing and Chief Medical Officer at the hospital and with the PCP - and how badly that went on so many fronts.     During the conference with the hospital the CMO assured me that the tests that the single good doctor said had not been done had in fact been done. I asked why I hadn't been informed why they had not updated me when my mother was discharged. They said that is not the way it's done that I have to ask for those records. [Johanna explained beautifully the procedures and process in response to my 9/24 vent.]     So on 9/24/2012 before I left the hospital I did in fact request those records. Filled out all the paperwork. They said I would either have to wait 30 minutes to 2 or 3 hours or they could mail it. Silly silly silly me. I chose to have them mail the records.     And if you recall the original vent the doctor strong-armed me into withdrawing the complaint against him and his practice threatening to drop my mom. So I withdrew the complaint as he requested and the DON confirmed that the hospital would not proceed with any inquiry against his practice.     Fast forward to today.     The PCP did finally agree to refill my mom's pain med (her lower back continues to get worse). The poor pharmacist called and said he had been advised in not-friendly tones by the doctor's office that my mom had a poor track record of not keeping appointments so they wouldn't ever refill her prescriptions again unless she made another appointment with the doctor.     BALD-FACED LIES! In three years she has *never* once missed a doctor's appointment. We did not keep the 9/6/2012 appointment mere days after she was in the hospital because she was so unstable. And I gave them plenty of notice before cancelling and asked for an October appointment (and never heard back from them).     Further I have repeated my request for an October appointment and still have not heard back from them. DESPITE having been strong-armed into withdrawing my complaint.     It gets better...     When I talked to the records people this afternoon the clerk said they could not release the medical records   because the doctors haven't signed off on them yet!   Now remember the single good doctor in all this told me that my mother had not gotten an MRI. The CMO claims her file shows an MRI.     Am I wrong to feel that there is something extremely rotten in Denmark? She was discharged on August 30 2012 four weeks + one day ago.     Really all these people are doing is driving me to find another doctor and hospital. Once that is done I almost assuredly will lodge a formal complaint with the Medical Review Board. I am sooo frustrated.     Edited to add: I asked the records clerk which doctors had not signed off on the reports. She said she couldn't give me that information.,False,TCUDeeCal,2012-09-02,374.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492201,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have been with her around the clock for the most part since August. I am lucky to be able to work from here. She was in a walker until August when she became too weak to use it and was put in a wheelchair. She became a fall-risk because she forgets she needs a wheel chair and would try to get up to walk. I think she is too weak to try that now but she still needs to be watched constantly due to some of her new issues.She was suffering from back pain and wasn't responding to treatment until hospice put her on decadron which has worked incredibly well. Mom had a mini-stroke in August and stopped eating for days. Then she bounced back some except she had a few seizures. Early last week she was eating very little again She then had another TIA and seizure has been very shaky on and off since then. Her blood pressure was low after the last seizure but  she has been eating well. Her language skills have gone down considerably in the last few days though and she sleeps most of the day. The excessive sleeping has been there since August but is a little worse now. She seems to be comfortable in bed but whenever we get her up to go to the bathroom or move her to or from her wheelchair she gets shaky and it seems to exhaust her. She has an irregular heartbeat in addition to all this.     Has anyone else seen seizures and mini-strokes in late stage Alzheimer's? She never had seizures until the last couple of months. I am not aware of her having mini-strokes/TIAs before August but I suspect she could have with her history of high blood pressure. She also has been short of breath this week on and off and felt ltightness in her chest. They tell me she likely has a couple of weeks unless she has a heart attack or major stroke. She is eating well though so I wonder about the two week assessment. The hospice nurse comes tomorrow so I will get her latest assessment. A nurse here in al gave me the 2week  prediction. If anyone has seen a LO experience anything like this or has any insight/advice-it would be appreciated. My thoughts go out to all of you with loved ones dealing with this awful disease.Thanks!,False,Tonic6390,2012-10-07,10.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492435,,,AlzConnected,,,

The doctors said her tests suggested Alzheimer's and that they could probably narrow it down over a year.  She was advised to start having someone come in to help and to restrict driving but they did not tell her to stop driving.  They prescribed Zoloft and Aricept but she refused to take them.  She rejected that diagnosis and decided her memory problems are due to depression and anxiety. (She's a former psychologist.)  She refused to go back to any of those doctors and will not tell her current doctors about it.  She currently lives alone in a city three hours from me. My brother and SIL check on her periodically.  They see her slipping but don't think we'd be able to invoke the POA or get guardianship just yet.    This year she started having pain on her left side in her back and legs. Her doctor sent her for an MRI which uncovered an atrophyic kidney.  She began seeing a urologist who wants her to have a test called retrograde pyelogram where they inject dye and take an x-ray to see whether the ""pipes"" are working.    I am going with her to the appointment in a couple of days because she can't comprehend or remember all of the medical stuff she has going on.      I thought I would ask if anyone has an LO with dementia who's taken this test and whether there were any complications that I should explore with the doctor.    My main concerns are (1) she might be under general anesthesia and there is some evidence that it causes significant decline; and (2) she absolutely will not take prescribed medicine and hasn't for decades because she thinks the salesman at the vitamin shop knows more than people who have actually gone to medical school.  It's likely the doctor will want her to take pain medication and an antibiotic.  She's also not capable of keeping up with when to take medication IMO.    This part is just a rant: I offered to go to the first urologist appt with her because she couldn't explain to me why she was supposed to go.  She gratefully accepted and admitted she couldn't understand what the doctors were saying.  Then she emailed me that she didn't want me to come that I was treating her like a child she didn't need any help she could take care of her finances just fine she was still capable of driving etc. No one had said anything about those things (to her anyway) but I know she's aware that she's slipping and is frightened.    It's a three-hour drive for me to see her and I figured I couldn't force my way into the doctor's office so I sent her a list of questions I would ask and let it go. Now the urologist wants to talk with her about doing this test. She invited me and asked me to write down questions she should ask. I told her I would come up for the day.  Then she uninvited me and told me she would gather information on her options and then talk them over with me and my brother.  She thought he was going to give her the option to have her kidney taken out. When I explained that no this was to discuss options related to the test she admitted she didn't understand very well and agreed to let me go with her. I'm expecting to be uninvited at any time but I'm going anyway and will guilt her into it by telling her I drove three hours there and and three hours back to help her.    I'm thinking about contacting the doctor and telling him about her dementia diagnosis.  But if he tells her I did that it will be all over.  She will go ballistic and I will not be able to help her in the future after she starts refusing to talk to me or letting me in her house.  I'm also hoping to convince her to sign a HIPAA release that (hopefully) I can use with her other doctors. I need to research this more though.    TL;DR:  My questions are:    1. If you have an LO who's had this test what was the aftermath like?  Were there any complications I should ask about?    2.  Has anyone tipped off a doctor about a dementia/AD diagnosis without the LO knowing about it?  How did you phrase it?

She has been my whole life 24/7 for the past 2 1/2 years. I know I have been on here bitching and moaning about her and how I hate this and blah blah. But she is now bed ridden. Unable to drink and her eating has gone down to once maybe twice a day. She has lost so much weight she's down to about 80 lbs give or take. Every time you touch her she cries out in pain you don't even have to move her just touch her. I thought I'd be ok when she passed on she'd be free of this I would be free of this but I realized today I won't be. I have been fighting back the tears all day. Trying not to think about it. Then I go in to check on her and see what she has wasted down too. You've heard the saying looks like a skeleton with skin on it well she does. You can see every bone in her body.

1439,6210c6457b65de9a5b682339,2147492340,2012-10-03 18:04:00,Take a look and let me know what you think.,Feel free to post any suggestions on something to add to this. I am giving it to Corner stone hospice for their new clients and for us here to help the new ones.          Things to considerwhen caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s or other degenerative braindisorders      I have learned these things from some helpful tips onalzconnect.com and some on my own through trial and error.      If you are caring for a loved one with ALZ the very firstthing you need to do is work with other family members to decide who will bethe primary caregiver and who will be back up (for respite care so you can geta break or if you get sick). Get this in writing and notarized so everyone is onthe same page. This should help protect you in the future from any ‘familyfeuds’. You will need to get power of attorney (POA) and/or health caresurrogate. Health care surrogate establishes one person to be in charge of anyand all health care decisions for your loved one. If your state recognizes aliving will get this done while your loved one is still clear in mind so noone can question your actions in the future. A living will states what careyour loved one wants or doesn’t want (i.e. feeding tubes artificial lifesupport etc…). Get the POA as soon as possible while your loved one is stillclear of mind this assigns one person to be in charge of their finances realestate pet care; whatever you the family and your loved one agree to. Some statesonly need 2 witnesses to the loved one’s signature some states have to benotarized you will need to check what is needed in your state. You will wantto get these things done while your loved one is still clear of mindotherwise you will have to go to court in front of a judge and this can getexpensive. Especially if there are other family members involved it will helpto keep family feuds down as it was established well in advance. I personallyhave not had to deal with this as my loved one (my mother in law) has no otherfamily she has only one son. He kept putting off getting the POA so I tookeverything into my own hands and got it done. I used Legalzoom.com. Was veryeasy and very fast and not very expensive.      Once you have the legal issues out of the way I would startlooking into different Hospice in your area (if you plan to keep your loved oneat home this will help a lot. I will tell our story on this later on) ornursing facilities if you choose the other route of admitting your loved one.I am just very picky on who cares for my mother in law one reason why I amcaring for her at home. Nothing but the best loving care. If you choose thenursing facility talk to the staff not the head staff the ones that actuallydo the most hands on with your loved one the nurses and CNA’s. Ask to speakwith some families of other patients there to get their feelings about the caretheir loved one is getting. Do your home work! You wouldn’t put your child inthe first place you find you would research the facility that is caring foryour child it’s no different for your loved one (they will become child-likeas the disease progresses).     Let’s talk about hospice for just a moment. I would like toshare with you how they have helped us on this journey. MIL was with Vitas forabout 7 months and we had to move to a different county and now she is withCornerstone. Vitas was great! I loved her nurse wonderful woman very caring.When MIL first got on hospice they supplied a wheelchair and a toilet chair(bedside toilet). I was able to get her pull-ups through them as well. As MILprogressed I was supplied with a hospital bed with rails and a specialrecliner with an attachable tray. I’m not sure about everyone with ALZ but MILwould get up and try to walk and would fall every time the new recliner helpedto keep her seated and she could eat drink and play on the tray. They also hada wonderful lady come 2-3 times a week to help shower/bathe her. I was able toget a lot of her medications through hospice at no charge that is a real bighelp especially when they come by fed-ex normally the next day. Anything Ineeded all I had to do was call and some one was there. Hospice also hassocial workers and pastors/preachers/spiritual leaders how ever you want tosay it. The social worker helps with state assistance programs such as foodstamps and state heath care (Medicaid). For me Vitas was not much help on thisside of the program not that they won’t be for you. Every situation isdifferent every family is different. After we moved and MIL was on Cornerstone(Cornerstone came to our old house to meet us and get her set up for theirservices to take affect once we were moved so there wasn’t a gap in care) I gotall the equipment I needed (the bed toilet chair and so on) pretty much thesame services as Vitas. The social worker with Cornerstone was able to get mehelp with buying my dogs food!! Yep you read right my dogs food!! My littleguy (adopted from the humane society) has severe allergies to wheat and grains andhas to be on a special limited ingredient food that is about $40 for a 15 lbbag. I had talked to the social worker about this and she made some phone callsand about a week later there was a 28 lb bag on my door step when I got backfrom picking the boy up from school. She also told me that they can pay a lightbill or water bill for me if I get too tight on funds. Not an every monththing but when I need it. I’m not saying that all hospices can/will do thisbut they do have a lot of help out there for you that you may not know about orbe able to find on your own.      We are going to talk about some stuff that you will want toget for your house to help keep your loved one safe from injury. I will make alist of stuff I have used myself and discuss how they work and how they helpedme better care for my MIL. Some of the things I will be listing and talkingabout you may think them to be demeaning to your loved one but remember theyare returning to a child-like state. Most of these things are for the laterstages 5 6 and 7. This is when I had to take control over MIL’s everydayactivities.       You     will want to child proof your home cabinet locks socket covers and so     on. Just as if you had a toddler in your home.   If you     do not have an alarm system in your home you will want to get some door     alarms for doors leading outside the home and one for their bedroom door.     The reason for this is simple they will wander if you are cooking or     cleaning or anything where you cannot ‘watch’ them. This will alert you to     the door opening and you can intercept them before they get lost or     injured. I mentioned one for their bedroom door the reason for that is     MIL would get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and try to     go out the front door. I would hear the alarm and get up with her and make     sure she redressed herself properly and get her back to bed safely. I got     mine at Wal-Mart they have singles for about $4 and a 3 pack for about     $10. They have two setting a siren and a chime like a door bell and can     be turned off as well when you don’t need it on.  You     will want to get a baby monitor so you can hear what is going on in their     room when they are alone in there in the middle of the night or afternoon     nap. MIL would get up in the middle of the night and start to go through     her dresser drawers or closet. She had two cats and she would scoop the     litter box with her hands and I would find used litter in her closet     dresser under her bed. Places you would never think to look. She would do     this with her pull ups as well. She would wet herself in her sleep and     wake up and take them off. The monitor helped with this because I would     wake up when I heard anything from her room and get her back to bed. Yes     there were many sleepless night but MIL was safe and I wouldn’t find used     cat litter or pull ups in places they didn’t belong.   Lots     of band aids and wound care items (hospice may help supply some of these     things). MIL would sit and pick at her arms and cause herself to bleed. These     also come in handy in the later stages as their skin becomes thin and they     will bruise easily and get a lot of skin tears MIL gets them around her     elbows more than any where else.   Gloves     will come in handy also. MIL would sit and bite her fingernails almost     completely off. It will help to reduce the self inflected wounds from     picking and scratching themselves.   Nasal     bulb syringe they will get to a point where they cannot blow their nose.     If they have allergies or a cold this could come in very handy.  Toddler     size sippy cups. There are several types on the market so you will need to     try the different ones to see which one your loved one prefers. But keep     in mind as they progress their needs will change and you may need to try     another type of cup so don’t discard any you have already tried. You may     want to look into the divided plates as well. MIL didn’t like her foods to     touch and spent most of dinner separating them instead of eating them. I     also used toddler size fork and spoon. She would try to take very big     bites and would choke on her food.  Pill     crusher and dipping sauce cup. I use these for her medications. Your loved     one will get to a point when they cannot swallow pills and you will need     to crush them and mix them with apple sauce pudding or yogurt (or     whatever your loved one prefers). You can check with the pharmacist to     make sure the medications can be crushed. Some capsules cannot and some     are extended release and shouldn’t be crushed.   You     will want to look into getting a blender to puree their food. The     type/brand/style is up to you. I find it much easier to feed her pureed     foods and the combinations are limitless. Especially with fruits. She     loves apple sauce so I buy the large jars and blend in fresh fruits so she     is getting the nutrients from them instead of the processed store bought     ones. You can also use apple juice (or orange juice) to blend the fruits     in instead of apple sauce or even yogurt works well. Once I have blended     the fruits in the apple sauce I put them into 4 oz containers and store     them in the fridge. I normally make 4 of them and that will last one to     two days. Depends on how much I can get her to eat. I also puree soup for     her to eat for lunch and dinner. If the soup or drink mix or whatever you     are blending for them is too thin you can get some ‘thick it’ and add as     directed to make it as thick as you need it in order for your loved one     not choke on the liquid. Talk to the hospice you have chosen about the     ‘thick it’ and they maybe able to supply it for you. I have found it     easier to blend her drink mix in the blender with the thick it (I get her     crystal light type drink mixes) it blends it much better than just     shaking it.   Baby     toys are great things to keep them occupied. I get MIL the ones for 6     months to 2 yrs old. I try not to get the hard plastic ones I don’t want     her to hurt herself with them. And just as an infant/toddler every thing     goes right into the mouth.  Using     a body pillow is a great idea especially if they are sleeping in a     hospital bed with safety rails. It helps keep MIL from hitting her head on     the rails or sleeping with her head right against them and helps to keep     her a little straighter in bed.  Posey     belt is useful if your loved one thinks they can still walk and tries to     get out of bed. The one I have is just like a little waist belt I got from     her last stay in the hospital. They were going to toss it in the trash and     so I took it home. I used it on her wheelchair first to help her stay     seated. She couldn’t walk without assistance and would constantly try to     get up from the chair. Then I got the hospital bed to use it on. It came     in handy shortly after we got the bed. I thought with the rails she was     staying in bed until one morning I came in and she was on the floor at the     foot of the bed. She had hit the top of her head on the corner of the     night stand and had a pretty good sized bump on her head.   Shower/bath     chair is a wonderful safety item you shouldn’t be without. If hospice     doesn’t supply it you can get one at Bed Bath and Beyond for about $35. Another     great safety item for the bath is the handle on the wall. I got one with     suction cups on it at Home Depot for about $15 or so. You just lift the     lever on either end and it comes right off. Quick and easy to use or     adjust as needed is very strong and does no damage to the shower/bath     stall and requires no tools to install.   You     may need to get a forehead thermometer. As they progress and start to     loose weight a regular thermometer will not work under the tongue or     under the arm. I got one at Walgreens for about $40. I talked to the     pharmacist which he thought would be better for my situation the ear or     forehead one. He said that the ear one would probably not work well as it     is made for children’s ears and may not get a proper reading.  Slip     proof socks are very handy to have. Even if your loved one cannot walk it     helps to keep their feet from sliding when you are trying to get them into     a chair or something where they have to stand on their feet like in the     bathroom.  2     cylinder shaped throw pillows. I have found they help MIL sit better in     her recliner especially when she falls asleep in it. I have also found     that those ‘U’ shaped travel neck pillows come in handy when she falls     asleep in her recliner to keep her head straighter and breathing is not     obstructed by a floppy head.  Hospital     type gowns or over sized t-shirts are really good for sleeping. I keep MIL     in her night shirts all day because we don’t take her out very often and     it is easier to toilet her if I don’t have to undress her. If you use     hospital type gowns or make your own by cutting the back and sewing ribbon     or string to tie it be careful not to place them on boney areas on the     back to avoid skin tears and pain from laying on the knot that can cause     bed sores. I would put one up near the neck (just under the collar) and     one near the waist.  Using     baby bath wash is great. It is tear free so it will not irritate their     eyes and is gentle as to not irritate their skin.  I use     baking soda when I wash her urine soaked clothes and bedding. It helps to neutralize     the odor. I found a large box of Arm &amp; Hammer laundry baking soda at     Wal-mart for about $3 in the laundry isle.  Bubble     wrap is great to protect your loved ones arms and/or head on the hospital     bed rails and on the arm rest of her recliner. In the later stages they     bruise very easily and skin tears are a given. Bubble wrap is inexpensive     and is a great protector.  Kitchen     dish towels can play a couple different roles here. One to help keep your     loved one occupied as they will fold it and unfold it for hours. The other     role is a bib you can just drape it over their chest or you can get fancy     and add ribbons to tie it around their neck. You can also sew on different     things to the one they ‘play’ with so they have different textures to explore.     MIL loves silky ribbons and soft furry type cloth.   Baby     gates could be of use to keep them from going into rooms you don’t want     them in. The only issue I have with this is that your loved one is tall     enough to try to step over them. Use with caution.  Dark     colored (black or dark blue) entry rugs can be of help to keep your loved     one from going out the front door. I haven’t tried this myself but have     heard that they think it is a hole in the floor and will not cross it.  ‘Diaper     bag’… yep you are there again. When you go out for the day you will want     to have at least one change of clothes you never know when you will have     an eating spill on the shirt or a potty accident. You will want to pack     some of the following (these are just suggestion add or delete whatever     you want) : 2-6 pull ups/diapers (depends on how long you will be out)     wet wipes to clean their ‘area’ gloves hand sanitizer hand lotion     small trash bags (to wrap the soiled undies in to throw away) hand/face     wipes pill box to carry medications in incase you are out when that time     comes pill crusher (if needed) apple sauce (or whatever your loved one     likes to take their medications in) in a secure bowl to give medication     plastic spoon extra sippy cup small container of their favorite drink (I     get those flavored mix packets for bottled water and carry those with us     makes it easier lighter to carry in the bag) and some toys to keep them     occupied.                                          Some helpful links         http://alzheimers.boomja.com       The link above is an Alzheimer’s library.

1440,6210c65e7b65de9a5b682391,2147492429,2012-10-06 19:07:00,Medical reports received - NO MRI (I am beyond angry),"To those of you longsuffering wonderful people who have followed the saga of my mother's hospitalization in August the horrible treatment she received and the CYA response from the Director of Nursing and the Chief Medical Officer... Well today it got worse.     I finally received the long-promised and signed medical reports. I am so far beyond anger that I'm having to take a really really deep breath and step back a hundred yards to keep from doing anything rash or stupid.      For starters - the biggie - despite the CMO's insistence that my mother did get an MRI (and he ""read"" off a report that allegedly ""proved"" she had) SHE DID NOT GET AN MRI. They never sedated her as the admitting doctor had ordered so she was too agitated for them to do the scan.     So I haven't got a clue what fictional account the CMO was reading from in his insistence during our September 24 meeting that she had in fact gotten an MRI. That also means that the RN on duty lied through her teeth when she told me ""Your mom behaved perfectly during her MRI. We didn't even have to give her a sedative because she was so calm!""     If that had been the only problem I would be much calmer. But:     1) The ER doc didn't take my mom seriously (and I had thought she was one of the good guys). She said my mother had no trouble walking or standing. Uh no she could do neither. She also said the CT scan was all right.     2) The neurologist stated that my mother was on Zyprexa ""for agitation."" Uh no she is on Zyprexa for severe psychoses for her debilitating delusions and hallucinations. His ""motor exam"" consisted solely of asking her to ""elevate extremities against gravity."" He carried out that ""exam"" while walking alongside her while she was on the way to the MRI that they didn't do.     He did not ask her to walk or stand and even wrote ""GAIT: deferred"" on her chart.     The neurologist also apparently did not examine her until five hours AFTER the RN originally ""discharged"" my mom when she said she wanted to go home. His exam (not the date he signed the record but the date and time of exam) appear to be five hours after the discharge two hours after I raised holy hell and said they were not to discharge her without her meds being stabilized. (It looks like they made another stab at an MRI but again without the sedative the admitting doctor ordered.)     3) The psychiatrist who examined (using the term loosely) my mother similarly did not read her chart. He said she was on 2.5 mg of Zyprexa (it's 5 mg which even the listing of meds the nurses gave her indicated). Very little of his report comes from his actual ""exam"" of my mother but rather from what nurses et al told him. He quotes other people extensively.     He said that during his ""exam"" my mother exhibited no signs of delusions so he saw no need for the Zyprexa! WTH!! In two minutes he could determine that she never has delusions? May he be covered with a fiery itch in places where it hurts forever and ever amen.     The psychiatrist also claimed to have reviewed her MRI. Uh no how can you review a scan that doesn't exist?     4) The hospital apparently did not process my mother's blood work until after she was discharged! Dayn2nite can probably explain this for me but the lab results show that the samples were run on 8/31/2012. She was discharged on 8/30. Almost every single element was off the charts wacky. Ironically the only thing that came back normal: Her cholesterol (she has long battled very high cholesterol).     5) The **ONLY** positives in the medical reports were the notes from the admitting doctor (subbing for the PCP but not part of the PCP's practice) and the physical therapy staff's notes. The admitting doctor nailed everything. Not only was his examination thorough but his conclusions were sound.     If any of the other physicians had bothered to read his notes her treatment would have been completely different. But they totally ignored what he wrote.     Among other things he DISAGREED with the ER doctor's evaluation of the CT scan. All the other doctors accepted her version that it was normal. The admitting doctor on the other hand noted that the CT scan shows severe atrophy.     6) The physical therapy staff noted my mother's extreme confusion inability to follow directions delusional questions (""are we going to dinner?""). They expressed extreme concern about her not just from a physical standpoint but also the mental behaviors they observed during PT.     PT staff also strongly recommended - all three times - that before my mother was discharged the hospital social worker and case worker should sit down with me (!) and discuss short- mid- and long-term care options for my mother. I asked for exactly the same thing!!! And did not get it.     7) Finally the PCP's colleague who signed off on the discharge apparently had not read her file in their practice nor had he read anything in her charts. He wrote ""She was cleared by neurology after an MRI of the brain showed no evidence of stenosis."" WTF? What MRI!?!     He also noted ""Plain film of the L-spine showed degenerative changes otherwise no acute compression fracture was noted."" Uhhhh since one of the reasons she was admitted was that three Tylenol-3 daily no longer takes care of the pain associated with her lower spine shouldn't the results he cites have triggered a little bit of medical evaluation meds to address the issue? No he just discharges her with excruciating unbearable pain.     Note too that the GOOD admitting doctor had said that if her back symptoms did not improve while she was in the hospital they should ""consider further imaging.""     The PCP's colleague also noted in his discharge papers that ""with PT she walked 600 feet - she was stable by discharge."" THAT IS NOT WHAT PT NOTES INDICATE!!!!!!!!     I cannot afford a lawsuit either from the expense or the time involved. But the clear malpractice that jumps off these pages really makes me angry.",False,TCUDeeCal,2012-09-02,374.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147492429,,,AlzConnected,,,

When you suspect your LO is hurting.,In the mid and late stages of dementia it may be impossible for your LO to communicate what is bothering them or if they are having pain. Over the years medical professionals developed several scales to help caregivers determine when pain and discomfort are an issue and when medication should be given or other steps taken to provide relief to the person with dementia.     One scale that is very useful is the Abby Scale found at:               http://prc.coh.org/PainNOA/Abbey_Tool.pdf      The Abby Scale depends on observations to determine how uncomfortable the individual may be. I always found it helpful and would recommend it for families to use at home.       Another scale that may be useful is the Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale  which combines pictures and numbers to allow pain to be rated by the user. It can be used in children over the age of 3 and in adults. The faces range from a smiling face to a sad crying face. A numerical rating is assigned to each face of which there are 6 total.   The idea is to show the person with dementia the different faces and ask which face matches their pain. The Wong Baker Scale can be found at: http://pain.about.com/od/testingdiagnosis/ig/pain-scales/Wong-Baker.htm      I have also found it useful to ask my patients if they have pain to put their hand on it. This has been very helpful even in the later stages of dementia and allowed us to treat for more specific problems like hairline fractures.     I hope this information is helpful. As caregivers we hate to see our LO suffer and if there is a way to determine how uncomfortable they are or to pinpoint the area of pain we can take steps to treat it.

My mother rarely shows sadness or cries...like ever...she does say daily she prays to die and questions ""what is wrong with my brain?""   when did my memory go wrong?""   etc   She is fully aware of her decline but not it's name. When she was first diagnosed she refused the medication and was adament that "" I will never forget my children.""       She takes 10 mg of celexa daily but I wonder if it needs increasing.   Maybe it's just a bad day but I have not seen her cry out of the blue.   She is eating well as we speak and is usually very vocal.   I wonder why she wouldn't answer me or if she could not answer me...if she didn't know what was wrong if she didn't want to hurt me by communicating something I would take offense to?  I don't know.  I guess the possibilites are endless.       I guess I am just thinking ""out loud""   I wish sometimes she was not so lucid as to be aware of what is happening to her.   Her physical health is fairly good  and I am so afraid of getting to where I cannot care for her at home because I cannot take watching her be so sad and scared.  I guess it is my duty to be strong continue laughter and a good environment ...but I have my own depression issues and it seems to be contagious in this house.   It doesn't help that she has little interaction with the tons of friends she had over the years.   I know many of you have posted about the same problem with ""friends"" disappearing after diagnosis.   Sometimes I wonder if she would be better off back in the nursing home where there is a lot of activity going on .It's nice for her to be in her home but the long stretches of time between day care on Thursday and when we go back on Tuesday lend themselves to long quiet stretches. She no longer enjoys tv so she sits at the table and does puzzles all day long.  I can't seem to get her interested in any other activities.      I have no idea the purpose of this post.  Self therapy I guess.  Just wondered if any of you had experience with sudden crying spells.  Mom came from a strong family where no one showed much emotion.   Anyway I hope this passes...might be the days getting shorter are creating havoc..     Thanks for listening...do not feel compelled to respond..or even read all this for that matter...although if you've made it this far it's too late! ha.",False,home again,2012-04-29,195.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491660,,,AlzConnected,,,

So what brings me out of lurking on the forums to actually re-start my account is a new problem we're dealing with.  She takes AD meds (aricept and namenda) and a small dose of seroquel.  For most of the time that she has lived in the memory care unit they have always had some problems with her refusing her meds.  She doesn't feel that there is anything wrong with her and who are these ""girls"" (the caregivers) to give her medicine?  They have done ok with getting by and some CG's are better then others with dealing with this (they try again later coax her with a treat etc)  She's particularly resistant to her evening pills.  Last week she began complaining of pain on/in her tongue.  She even managed to convince one of the caregivers to call her an ambulance to take her to the ER in the middle of the night!  (That's a whole different post!)  The ER saw no problems and discharged her.  She continued to complain so I took her to her primary care doc who diagnosed her with oral thrush.  She was prescribed 5 chewable tablets a day to take care of this.  So now instead of having to deal with giving her meds twice a day the caregivers need to get her to take these tablets 5x a day and she's basically refusing them all because the caregivers ""aren't doctors so who are they to give me medication.""  All of this leads back to the agnosia and her questioning why she is living in the assisted living when she would be perfectly fine at home.      Has anyone ever dealt with med refusal at an ALF?  She will take them for me (in person) but I live 45 mins away and can't be there 5x a day to give her these tablets and until she takes them regularly she's not going to feel better.  I spent 2 hours with her earlier today and she happily took one of the tablets for me and had no complaints about her tongue.  30 minutes after I got home she was calling wanting to go to the hospital because of her tongue and when I suggested that she needed to continue taking the tablets from the caregiver she started in on the question of why they had control of her medication and why was she there...it's a loop that I can't get her out of.  There is no good answer and she's no longer buying my ""blame the doc"" routine.      Any suggestions would be appreciated!  One thing that I had read was to have them crush the meds and add them to food (her doc actually recommended this) but the ALF will only do that if SHE signs a form giving them permission to hide her meds in food...does that make sense to anyone?  My sister was more them willing to sign as her healthcare proxy but that wouldn't satisfy them.  So I guess grinding them up is out!

She's been on Aricept (with Namenda added in January 2012) and Zyprexa since June 2009. The Zyprexa has seemed to be ineffective recently as she's started experiencing delusions and hallucinations again. ""Is everyone coming to dinner?"" for example when it's only the two of us.     On Monday she started exhibiting signs of a stroke - slurred speech couldn't stand up very very dizzy. Called the doctor's office even though I knew her PCP was on vacation until September 4. They said to get her to the hospital asap. I reminded them I was in Camarillo (65 miles and 1-1/2 hours away with no traffic) so asked specifically that our doctor's sub be on standby.     Got to the ER around 4:30 p.m.. The intake clerk was wonderful but the intake RN was awful. He clearly had no experience dealing with dementia patients. Although I had clearly stated she had dementia and they should only deal with me he started evaluating her while I was parking the car. By the time I got there he had classified her as ""low priority"" - deeming no stroke risk because he believed her responses to the standard questions!     The intake clerk believed me however and kept advocating to get her to the CT scan as higher priority. She couldn't get them to budge. I even called the doctor's office (the sub who had told me to get to the ER had left for the day). No one would help. It was almost three hours after we arrived at the hospital before she had her CT scan and test for UTI.     CT scan negative UTI positive. ER doc prescribed antibiotics and wanted to keep her overnight. Long struggle with my mom about this (she is paranoid about my leaving her drives me absolutely NUTS) that was resolved when she started throwing up and decided she felt bad.     It was past 11 p.m. before they got her to a room. The doctor who took over was excellent (not anyone from our PCP's practice). He listened to everything I said about the September 6 plans and ordered MRI-brain MRI-lower back cardio work physical therapy to determine strength neurologist to reevaluate her Zyprexa and more lab tests to figure out if there were other infections at work. He also specifically ordered Ativan (sedative) before the MRIs so she could handle them.     The next day the RN on duty told me that my mom had handled the MRIs just fine without a sedative but that she had ordered a urine specimen because she thought she might have a UTI. I told her the ER doctor had already determined she had ""acute UTI"" and had prescribed antibiotics. She said she would look into it. She also said the neurologist had said she would prefer to wait till the results of all the tests came back to determine if something else had interfered with Zyprexa's effectiveness before she simply changed the meds.     But the next day........ they tried to discharge my mom! They said they had taken her off Zyprexa and put her on Depakote. I protested and said I didn't think she should be sent home the same day they changed her anti-psychotic meds. They said ""Oh well if something goes wrong just bring her back."" I said - CAMARILLO! SIXTY-FIVE MILES.     I spent literally 3-1/2 hours trying to get someone to advocate on my mom's (and my) behalf. The PCP's office would *not* page either of his colleagues. The case worker wouldn't return my calls. The neurologist would not call (and they had changed neurologists in mid-stream - the new one was a man). I was furious.     Called the L.A. Alzheimer's Association and got wonderful help from a volunteer and then from a case worker. Both recommended immediately contacting the hospital's ombudsman to get action. So I did.     Called the number the hospital gave me and they said they were NOT the hospital's ombudsman but rather they were ombudsman for long-term care facilities. They said that Providence St. Joe's has a ""patient's advocate"". So I called back and left a message for the person to whose voice mail I was transferred. Told her I was leaving Camarillo right then but it would be right at 5 p.m. by the time I got there so please. don't. leave.     Arrived at 5:10 p.m. She had left. The volunteer at the front desk said that actually that woman wasn't the patient's advocate that PSJMC no longer had a patient's advocate. The woman whose voice mail I had reached had just been transferred to a different department with no replacement for her services.      When I explained what was going on the volunteer raised holy hell on my behalf and tracked down a supervising RN. That person then advocated for my mom - got her another night for observation and found a doctor who checked the charts.     It turns out that my mother had had neither MRI because they had not given her the Ativan and she would not stay still. He tried to contact someone but no one responded.     Fast forward to today. My mom is home  in worse shape than before.  When I went to get her new prescription filled the pharmacist (a wonderful person) expressed great alarm - for exactly the same reasons I had worried. He said a person should never go cold turkey off Zyprexa as the risks are too great.     Additionally my mother never received the antibiotic the ER doctor had prescribed! It clearly stated UTI at the top of her chart (along with other things) and they ignored their own prescription! So I have no idea if the infection is part of the problem.     I've temporarily made an executive decision to leave her on the Zyprexa and not start the Depakote.     But I feel so beat up.     Does anyone with a bit more objectivity have any advice? I *did* write a detailed letter to the hospital CEO (which he obviously will not receive until Wednesday September 5). So I have documented everything minute by minute hour by hour name by name (both good and bad).   What else should I be doing? And I am really afraid that it will be a while before I can convince her to go back to the doctor. It was a very very bad experience for her.     As I said she is in worse shape than before even clingier than before Monday way more confused and agitated.",False,TCUDeeCal,2012-09-02,374.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491426,,,AlzConnected,,,

Afterwards I camped out at the PCP's office until he saw me.     I came away from the experience feeling more beat up than usual. I wanted to scream: ""Doesn't anyone CARE ABOUT MY MOTHER?!""     The CMO said that an MRI had indeed been done. I asked why the doctor told me it had not. They said they would look into the timing that it was possible it had been done *after* he reviewed her records. I asked why I had not been given the results of the MRI - if it had indeed been done - upon discharge. They said that you have to specifically ask for that kind of information it is not provided automatically! (Huh?)     I told them that I was still upset that the neurologist had taken her off Zyprexa cold turkey without putting her on another anti-psychotic that I had read all the literature about Zyprexa and seen people's experiences here on this board with LO's being taken off Zyprexa cold turkey. They said I couldn't go by what people on this board or what the literature said that the neurologist would know best and his decision trumped anything I read about withdrawal from this anti-psychotic.     I then pointed out that the neurologist (and it turns out a psychiatrist too) had never called me to discuss my mother's diagnosis that they had just done all this stuff without talking to me. They agreed that the failure in communication was upsetting but they said all doctors associated with PSJMC are independent contractors so they could not and would not take any action because of lack of communication.     The DON further said that all the nurses' notes stated that my mother was coherent and presented no symptoms of dementia so they felt that they should communicate with her and not with me. I nearly lost it at that point and told them that at every single step of this ordeal I had pointedly told every nurse and every doctor about my mother's diagnosis and had even sent a copy of the DPOA and AHCD in June *and* brought a copy with me to the hospital (which no one wanted to see) so there was no excuse.   Further one of the ER RNs had administered the usual ""questions"" test and my mother failed every single question. I told the DON that if her nurses had bothered to ask ""Mrs. H what is 100 - 7?"" They would have known immediately that she was incapable of answering for herself.     The DON said well but since she appeared coherent when my mother said on Wednesday that she wanted to go home the RN on duty felt that she had to honor my mother's request and prepared the discharge papers. At that point I screamed inside but stayed relatively calm on the outside.     I wanted to YELL: ""Don't you know that dementia patients want to go home EVEN WHEN THEY ARE HOME?!"" Instead I told her that perhaps her nursing staff needed to be re-trained in dealing with dementia patients so they understood that not all dementias ""look"" the same and that some advanced cases of dementia can ""present"" normal until you scratch below the surface.     She said that was a valid point and that she would try to make the next mandatory session for the nursing staff a course on dealing with patients with dementia. They evidently have a resource with Leeza's Place who is available for training.     The CMO said that according to the records everything had been done for my mother that could be done. I said well no that's not true. If she went in with lower back pain that is no longer controlled by three Tylenol-3 per day and if she is still talking to my dead father clearly she did not receive adequate care.     He said he would put my mother's case forward to peer review. They also got me the contact information for the neurologist and psychiatrist who ""treated"" my mother so I could talk to them directly. I ordered her medical records before I left so as soon as they arrive (by mail) I will call them and find out what the hell was going on and why they ""treated"" my mother without my being present since it had been made crystal clear that they were to talk to me. So that is a whole other battle I get to fight.     Finally I walked over to the PCP's office and just sat until he would see me. I made it clear I wasn't going anywhere.       He was pissed that I had written the hospital. He said if his partners saw the letter they would demand that he stop treating my mom because I ""badmouthed"" them to the hospital. I pointed out that I had called and called and called and they refused to talk to me while she was in the hospital.     He said he would talk to them but the condition for him continuing to see my mother was that I had to write the DON and CMO and ask them not to contact his partners or pursue any inquiries regarding them. I just did but it felt empty when I did so.     Again with him I wanted to yell: WAIT A MINUTE! WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ASK ME HOW MY MOTHER IS DOING? Because he never did.     I am so stressed right now I can hardly bear it.

My kids felt awful and I felt horrible that I made them feel bad they were just teasing they weren't being mean at all.

These phrases came from people who have great experience in the Elderly-Mental world.      It took me several weeks to let the intent of these phrases sink into my thinking by osmosis. But when they did reach my thought process the phrses were the first planks to my abbreviated healing:     1) I am a good husband. (Fill in your own relationship).     2) I do the best I can.     3) Leave the guilt behind.     4) There is no reason that the mental failure of one relative should claim the lives of other relatives.,False,Zolly,2011-12-15,2283.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491398,,,AlzConnected,,,

I have looked but only found one on the topic and it didn't seem to apply. I placed this question earlier today in the Solutions section but am following Mimi's suggestion to ask it over here on the Caregivers Forum.    Our 88-year-old Dad is probably transitioning between stage 5 and stage 6. He is severely depressed and presently a patient at the Older Adult Mental Health unit of the local hospital. This hospital is the recommended place for such care in our city. He arrived on the unit on Monday night. Yesterday Wednesday the primary attending psychiatrist called to recommend electric shock therapy (ECT). The doc claims that ECT is the fastest and most effective treatment for elderly dementia patients.  All three of us kids have a profound disinclination towards that treatment. We fear further confusion and memory loss. Of course what has to be balanced is acceleration of the inevitable versus easing the mental pain that Dad is presently suffering.     We plan to first see if the prescribed anti-depressant drugs will start to kick in and also get a second opinion but I also thought I would seek the wisdom of this community.     Thanks in advance for your help.,False,pizza,2012-06-04,32.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489166,,,AlzConnected,,,

I am 61 years old. I feel I have in the last year started to decline more. My short term memory is worse I try to cover up more now. I don't want long conversations anymore because I get lost for the right word.      I have been having the last 6 months or so bad pain in the middle of my forhead. My spelling is so bad these days excuse the mistakes. My ALZ Dr. told me two parts of my brain are dying and I thought maybe that was why I was having the pain. I was never one to get headaches. It's not a headache it's just a pain between my forhead. Does anyone else have this problem?      My husband and I started our third support group a few weeks ago. I like it better than the others there are more people my age. First time there are others that have not had this terrible Alz in their life. We have enjoyed the group met some really nice people. I do wish there was more time to speak one on one with others like myself. But there's not time the way they have it set up.      One thing I have noticed the past few years is so many friends that we have had for 20 to 30 years just stopped calling or coming over. These were people that were we thought were some of our best friends. I think it bothers my husband more than me although he does have for the past 6 years severe heart failure. In my mind I think if my friend was sick I would call and visit them. But thats just the way we are.      Lisa Iris Lisa miss your blog I was wondering how is Mary in  W. VA. doing?

Some may not even remember me but I just wanted to express my gratitude on this page for all the help and guidance that has been provided to our family.      After a long battle with Alzheimer's my mother inlaw passed away this past Friday on her 86th Birthday. We buried her yesterday and I feel compelled to thank those who helped us. This board has been a tremendous help to some of our darkest days. Only because of some of you who took the time to share your knowledge. For that I'm most appreciative.      We put her on hospice aprox. 6 weeks ago and she passed in what I guess you would consider a peaceful way due to the assistance provided from hospice. The one thing that really bothers me is the cause of death. ""Failure to Thrive"" grrrrhhh only because this horrible illness ate her brain. I guess that's because we never had her formally diagnosed however it was agreed upon that she had the illness with the Doctors.      I will continue to pray that other families don't have to endure the pain some of us have and contiune to support Alz research in any way possible.      Once again Thank you all for the help you provided to our family some may not even know the help they provided. God bless each of your loved ones.",False,Mistic1961,2011-12-21,40.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491369,,,AlzConnected,,,

Don't worry I have doctors and would never do anything without their approval and understanding of the problem.  That said I also know people of certain age or with complicated illness often react differently than expect to medication.  .   Let me explain the signs and symptoms . My wife is at a level 5 at least by the scale. So yes there are a ton of changes she has gone through and not much she can clearly understand anymore.  She grimaces most of the time and appears near tears.  She is very anxious and nervous.   Fear and some delusionsand  hallucinations   There is wringing of hands   Eating very little.  Fixating on a single thing trying to put it some where.  She can become bored and do something like fixating on the buttons of her shirt and twist them all off..  .  My impressions  when ask she is not near tears or in any pain and usually rambles about something incoherently.  Really no symptoms of physical pain at all.  She wants to escape escape from herself and mental problems.  She want so escape her home her clothes everything associated with her and her disease. Like running away would allow her to return to her normal self.  .  I spend most of the day either riding her around or trying to find some people she see can watch or interact with. Trying to find things that please her or distract her.  .  I have 0.5 Ativan that I give her when she is very anxious and can't break the cycle. One helps her some two makes her a pillow on the couch. That is her only drug other than a daily 25 mg atenolol for BP.  .  I am thinking she might need something she can take each morning and have a better day without being to drugged out experience her surroundings   .   So if you have used a drug with success in controlling these symptoms please let me know.  I will read up on it and that way when we see the doctor again I will be aware and help him select something to help her.  I don't expect one thing to fix everything just have a list of what might help.  .   That's my request if you can help.,False,Homer_E_S,2012-02-09,390.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491562,,,AlzConnected,,,

About a month ago she fell cracked 3 ribs &amp; punctured and partially collapsed her lung. She was in the hospital 6 days. They discovered a UTI and she had MRSA(I think that is what they call it - it is an infection that is resistant to antibiotics commonly found in nursing home residents.) Anyhow they had put a tube in her chest to get the air out of her chest cavity. A new xray shows blood or fluid in the lung a sign some of it is collapsed again. The doctor recommended another surgery to put in a bigger tube and a longer hospital stay to drain it.   My mother mumbles constantly cannot follow verbal directions doesn't recognize anyone &amp; is completely incontinent. Before she got so bad she was afraid of doctors hospitals etc. &amp; has been sensitive to pain her whole life. She used to get gas from the dentist just for a teeth cleaning when I was a kid.  It was a chore to get her to the doctors office;she made her feelings known by refusing to get out of the elevator;refusing to enter the waiting area etc. Luckily she temporarily has an additional one on one caregiver who was able to get her to cooperate eventually.  The doctor suggested palliative care &amp; we are going to use it. She signed a DNR years ago &amp; made her feelings known. I don't believe she would want another trip to the hospital.   I haven't posted on these boards in awhile but I lurk often &amp; I thought maybe writing this out could help someone else going through the same thing.

Although I knew he was getting closer to his end his death felt way too sudden.         I took care of him here at home for about a year and a half. Before that I looked out for him at his home while my brother ( an alcoholic ) lived there. I could not trust him so I had to keep an eye on things constantly. Then my brother developed liver failure and I took my Dad home to live with us.          Long story as short as I can make it as you all know getting the meds right is a challenge. He was on seroquel for about 6 months till it stopped working. Then he was on risperdone for about 4 months till he entered the nursing home  1 and half months ago . The doctor there did not like anyone on  risperdone so they slowly weaned him off and started him on a cocktail of depakote requil back on seroquel and adivan due to extreme restlessness ( which I believe was caused by suddenly taking him off the risperdone) and adding all the other crap....but I am no doctor so what do I know.          Instead of getting him stable and his behavior under control each day he only got worse. So much so they began the process of moving him to a behavior unit in a another facility because he was combative.  He was fine when we put him in the facility mind you...a little unsteady on his feet and starting to mumble instead of talk. B efore the transfer was to happen he stopped being able to walk talk and started to slowly eat way less food. He lost 30 lbs in one month. I felt he was dying but the doctor said all his lab work came back fine. ugh!  He did not look fine to me. I was not trying to keep him alive mind you....but I certainly did not want him dying a slow death without proper ""comfort"" and I felt he was suffering in ways he was not suffering at home.  I kept asking him if he was in pain and he'd shake his head no but his agitation and restlessness was relentless and getting worse.  My hands were tied because there was no way I could handle him at home...I was waiting for the transfer.....where I thought they would find a better mix of meds to help him. I was there every day trying to get him to eat or drink. This past week he was eating and drinking practically nothing.          How does a staff of nurses and doctors not see that someone is on their death bed? I felt he was but they said no. I should have listened to my instincts. I needed to have that confirmed so I could be there for him in his last hours. No one called. He died alone! They claim he was awake for morning meal that he barely took and a half hour later he was gone. How does that happen? Was this the disease or the medications? I will never know! I felt so guilty and helpless wondering if I did the right thing by putting him there in the first place. I did so because his care was getting harder for me to manage frankly I was burned out physically and mentally.         Now  I am very torn and very upset wondering if or how he may have suffered. They said the last week he kept calling out my name.....even when I was there he was calling my name. It was heartbreaking to hear.  Was he begging for help or was that just the disease. ugh!  I know I will get over this but I am not dealing well with it at the moment. I just have so many unanswered questions that the facility and doctor cannot answer.          Thank you all for your moral support all the times I needed it here on this wonderful board....an awesome community of help and inspiration.............thank you!",False,FluffyChenille,2011-12-19,221.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147491329,,,AlzConnected,,,

She has had no contact with any family illness and especially so ongoing Alzheimer. Her biggest worry is getting a husband. She is near 40 a college educated engineer specialist. She has been communicating with me for approx 8 years. I give this Bio to lead up to a point.     From this problem free friend who is surrounded by huge family she advised me ""You are doing the best you can"". One of my own phrases I try to sell to others but this time it struck me as not only advice but also as a true painted picture of myself.      Being in my 9th year of Dementia with my wife I am just about wrung out. However I finally realized their is not much more I can do for my wife except visit her in her Care Facility. At one point I was ready to end my life due to the excrutiating pain I was carrying but now realize I just loved my wife too much and wanted to fix something that was not fixable.  My wife is in at least a good Care Facility. Has all the Meds the Doctor prescribes. Eats well. Sleeps like I do from bad to almost not bad. Has plenty of clothing. The only differece is that we are apart wife Jane in a Care Facility that is restrictive in foot travel and me out here alone able to go anywhere but don't.      I think what happend was my friend said the right words at the right time. I have given my all and cannot give anymore. I am now just one of the milestones in the path of my wife's Alzheimer after almost 9 years. The part that cared so much has apparently dried up and died and the rationale part of me lives on.

As is very common her condition can change from day to day but still in a general direction for the worse. She reached the point where if she was even awake at all she couldn't communicate anymore and hardly showed the sign of being aware of my presence. I've been using alternative  medicine  for a few years now to treat my depression anxiety and also for general health. I've since discovered the overlooked value of the herb Rosemary and now use it to treat the symptoms of my depression. I've also noticed better clarity of thought along with an improved short term memory. I was able to get the doctor's permission to give this herb to my mother and we figured at least it couldn't hurt. Much to my surprise there's been a noticable change. There have been quite a few day now where my mom has been more focused and alert than she's been in a long time. I even got some news from one of her nurses who said my mother had a brief conversation with her. Its been at least a year or two since I can remember anything like that. This change has also been noticed by others on the nursing staff as well as her doctor who is very surprised. Now I'm not suggesting this is any kind of a ""cure"" for Alzheimer's but the improvement in my mother's condition is something to be said about Rosemary and it's given me some more quality time with her that I thought had been thing of the past.........Gary       But with reduced medications the woman at the Two Harbors home did seem to awaken. She was able to speak — haltingly and not always understandably but enough to communicate. And what she let Ms. Lanigan know after years of being virtually nonverbal was that she was suffering physical pain the cause of her crying out.  It took doctors a while to find effective medications for her nerve condition but they were eventually able to make her more comfortable without further fogging her mind. She stopped taking psychotropic drugs altogether.       http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/clearing-the-fog-in-nursing-homes/       Perhaps the most powerful information to come from Facility One is the story of an elder we will call Sally. Sally described by the staff as a sweetheart“hollered” non-stop. The only time she was not yelling (loudly) was when she was sleeping. Within one week after Restore Peace was introduced her screaming decreased by 50%. By the end of the second week it had stopped completely. Even after the completion of the study she shrieks only occasionally. She no longer takes Respiridol an antipsychotic medication she was able to move off the “dementia unit” into another part of the facility.     Mrs. B always remained in bed before the aromatherapy program started.  She refused to leave her room and participated in no activities. She offered many complaints throughout the day about the place she is living and about her life in general. After being introduced to the Promote Alertness oil a staff member gave the following description of Mrs. B: “She is now a completely different person. She is out of her room a lot and enjoys almost every activity that is offered. She no longer complains very much. She is doing very well.”  As shared by staff “Mr. S. was always very tired and always sleeping. He had no energy to do anything. Now he has lots of energy and goes out with his family. His wife takes him out for three days and she says “He does real good when he is at home. He walks now; before he didn’t. He is more alert now. So he is doing real good.”   These words were written by Mr. S.’s wife: “I thank God for person or persons like you for going all the way out to make someone like my husband and others to do better. And I can tell in my husband that he is doing better a lot better. At first he was sleeping a lot angry he didn’t want to do anything. He’d want me to do everything for him when I took him home for a visit. But now he’s more alert we made plans to renew our wedding vows.  A week before and I asked him what are we going to do Saturday he’d say ‘getting married’ which other times he’d forget right away. I asked him do you want me to push you in the wheelchair at church he told me ‘no I’ll walk’ and he did. He used to play the accordion and the guitar but after all that he’s been through; he had lost the ability and interest to play. Now he’s trying to play again. Thank you very much.”       http://www.scentsiblesolutions.com/html/texasstate.html       “It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately it’s like she has been reborn” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”      http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/newsstory.cfm?ID=947          I have been using essential oils on my husband who has moderate vascular dementia in conjuction with low photon light therapy. The oils help to calm him during periods of agitation and nervousness and sedate him at night. Other residents in the facility where he is are lethargic all day and sleep until dementia drugs and anti-anxiety meds start to wear off at night and then become confused and agitated while my husband is alert and walking the halls looking for something to do. I know the oils can’t change the course of the disease but it is a better alternative than chemical restraints and antipsychotic drugs. Essential oils are healing whether inhaled or topical and I am glad to see that they are getting acknowledged for use with dementia.

I'm new here but have been reading around for the last two days. You guys all seem very kind and helpful already I've gotten a lot of good information and some peace..... and I'm so sorry that this situation exists for so many!     My grandma is in her late 80's/early 90's. She has had scitsophrenia or paranoid scitzophrenia for most of her life I guess. I grew up next door to her and it was common for Meirma to be ""crazy"" it was just like the seasons of a year there would be seasons in our lives where our sweet grandma was a horrible scary dellusional creature. She had an invisible boyfriend called the cops on neighbours called the fire dept on pretend fires became obsessed with religion but focused on negative parts would re-live past things that had upset her spoke to angels in the bathtub drain gave birth to spiritual angel/alien babies..... so much more...... and then it would come to a head and she would be finally be put away and eventually she's return to us with whatever new medicine and she would be our dear old lovely Meirma once again....     It was always a meds problem. They stopped working or she stopped taking them.      So she's been on heavy antipsychotics (I know that at one point she took/takes something like Haldol?) for forever and about 6 months ago she got Shingles and has been  so sick and out of it ever since. I know she's taking at least two vicodin a day for shingles pain but i don't know what else she's taking.     I don't know if she has alzheimers or not. She asks the same question over and over and the response is like the first time she's heard it. Sometimes she doesnt remember if you visited her yesterday or what she had for dinner last night. She drifts off to sleep constantly. She tells you the same stuff again and again. My grandpa said that he can no longer carry on a conversation with her and for him to even admit that is big - he's a very personal man... he also told my mother that he doesnt think she will be around next year... we are all watching her fade away.     But she can also laugh at jokes give her little disaproving half smile if the joke is off-colour knows who i am teases me about my hair picks outfits out of catalouges and remembers to show me what she picked... its weird how its so off-and-on. Her only dellusion now is ""The Horse"". Apparently theres this horse she thinks is so funny who she always sees outside. None of her bad dellusions are there just this innocuous horse. She can tell stories with great detail about the past but has trouble coming up with the words...      I need to know if her medicines are doing this to her and if it can be reversed or stopped or slowed. Its difficult for me to find info or be taken seriously. Even though I'm 31 I'm still the little granddaughter daughter and niece.       I have the same doctor as her the same GP and I personally don't trust this woman. She allowed a disease that I had to progress to the point where i lost my ovary by dismissing my complaints. My grandparents are much less likely than i am to try and get help from this doctor and I'm positive that my grandpa just accepts the situation and isnt demanding answers or asking questions.      Sorry this is so long sorry for the awful spelling sorry that its mostly just a rant with no real questions...",False,Crimson,2012-08-08,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147490827,,,AlzConnected,,,

Methyl phenols can damage the liver when taking internally but fortunately methyl phenols (such as carvacrol thymol and eugenol) contained in several essential oils (bay laurel clove holy basil thyme and rosemary) can be inhaled into the hippocampus the part of the brain most damaged by peroxynitrites. Human clinical trials using essential oils have partially reversed Alzheimer’s disease. Aromatherapy is generally safe but can increase anxiety in individuals taking anti-anxiety medications or medications for hyperthyroidism and can increase anxiety high blood pressure and risk of seizure in people with high levels of adrenaline (which includes a subtantial minority of people with Alzheimer’s disease). The use of more relaxing oils (such as lavender rose or orange) weaning people off of anti-anxiety medications or if necessary the use of medications to lower adrenaline levels may offset these problems. Otherwise aromatherapy is the most effective means currently available to treat Alzheimer’s disease.     Anything that inhibits the formation of peroxynitrites delays the onset of Alzheimer’s disease anything that stops the subsequent formation of peroxynitrites stops the progression of the disease anything that scavenges peroxynitrites and partially reverses their damage partially reverses the disease. We can continue to spend millions of more dollars to fund Alzheimer’s organizations and Alzheimer’s research centers and we can sit by as pharmaceutical companies dangle one great hope after another and let themselves and some of their shareholders bask in the temporary uptick of their stocks or we can finally serve the people suffering from this disease and all the millions of others who lovingly take care of them despite all the pain frustration and anguish.,False,Lane Simonian,2011-12-12,5049.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147490915,,,AlzConnected,,,

Most reimbursement sources  require          a prognosis of six months or less  if the illness runs its normal course.      In 2000 the  Alzheimer’s Association Ethics Advisory Panel   agreed          that Alzheimer’s disease in its advanced stage should be defined          as a terminal disease.           What are the signs of advanced stage Alzheimer's?  Basically        the indicators are the inability to:   recognize loved ones  communicate by speech  ambulate or  maintain bowel or bladder control   When these indicators are exhibited regularly  death          can be expected within a year or two regardless of medical efforts .          Given typical medical problems arising at this time the Panel noted          that efforts extending life during this stage created ""burdens and          avoidable suffering for patients who could otherwise live out the remainder          of their lives in greater comfort and peace"".     So  what does this mean to you as the caregiver?  Hospice        is usually only available to those with six months or less to live. Alzheimer's        patients at the ""end stage"" can realistically expect to live another        one to two years. Yet during that time they decline dramatically may        be in extensive pain and are no longer able to communicate. If after        learning about the hospice philosophy you decide that it is right for        your family member and your family member has reached the end stage of        Alzheimer's  talk to your doctor . As more people bring        this issue to light and ask for help the more likely it will be that        help will become available. Also talk to your local        Alzheimer's Association.

Bit of a sleepless night.     My dad's got unspecified dementia. His mom (dead since the early 80's) had Alzheimer's so I'm pretty sure he's got it too. He started some memory tests earlier this year but had to stop due to some health issues which cropped up plus my mom had liver cancer and died earlier in the year. He finishes up the tests next Tuesday (only 2 hours of that left thankfully) then we'll know what he's got and what stage he's at.     His primary care physician gave him some Xanax to help him sleep at night since he's got some anxiety issues and it caused his dementia symptoms to explode last week. I took him off the Xanax a week ago (after talking to the doc) and he's gotten back to normal somewhat - the only difference is he seems more confused at times than he did before he was on Xanax. It's like the pill left a mark or something.     Another part of the problem is he doesn't get quality sleep - he tosses and turns a lot. During the day when he's napping (he'll do this in short bouts) it's like he's being attacked by something. He'll move around and whimper/cry out in pain.      Overall he has his faculties (some days are better than others) but he tends to do best in the afternoon.     He's also got undiagnosed inattentive ADD (which I was diagnosed with years ago) which masked the symptoms to me till about 1 1/2 months ago since some of the behavior mimics dementia (losing car keys leaving the TV/lights on short attention span and memory for some things etc.).,False,Rolander,2012-07-27,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147490517,,,AlzConnected,,,

1475,6210cc527b65de9a5b68383c,2147489381,2012-06-29 10:38:00,Helping your LO sleep better at night.,People withdementia often have problems sleeping at night. Sleep disturbances in thispopulation can take a toll on both the family and the person with dementia.Caregivers worry about wandering incontinence issues possible falls and otherproblems. However the amount of wakefulness at night may depend on the stageof the dementia. People in the earlier stages of Alzheimer’s for example maysleep more or wake up confused. Later in the disease Alzheimer’s patients tendto “nod off” more during the day and wake more at night. In the final stages ofAlzheimer’s caregivers find that their LO doze irregularly day and night.                 I’d like to discusssome of the things family caregivers can do to help their loved ones sleepbetter at night. The following suggestions have been found to work well:             1)            Expose the person with dementia to naturalsunlight for an hour or two each morning and again in the afternoon if possible(Don’t forget sunglasses a hat and sun screen). If sunlight is not availableor being outside is not possible light therapy with a full spectrum light bulbmay be helpful.    This is done becauseeach of us has a set of rhythms which our body uses to regulate our systems.They are called circadian rhythms and help us to determine our wake/sleepcycles among other things. Circadian rhythms need natural lighting to functionwell.             2)            Caregivers should take steps to avoid caffineand alcohol in their LO diet. This is especially true in the late afternoon andevening as it takes several hours for caffine (which is a stimulant)    to clear the body. Likewise after the initialrelaxation a person may feel from an alcoholic drink there is a “bounce back”when the alcohol acts as a stimulant which can disturb sleep.             3)            Limit daytime napping. If caregivers find theirloved ones are sleepy during the day a one hour nap is preferable to manyshort naps or sleeping longer than one hour.             4)            Encourage exercise. Exercise helps to tire aperson out but also brings on a relaxation response. Exercising in lateafternoon an hour or so before dinner can help to assure a better night’ssleep.             5)            Keep a regular schedule for waking and sleepingif possible. Getting up at approximately the same time each morning andretiring at the same time each night helps make bedtime a little easier.             6)            A white noise machine or soft music can be usedto block out any distracting noises in the home and a small night light can beused for safety but leaving lamps or lights on in the room will encourage wakefulness.             7)            If the above steps do not seem to be helpingconsider a physical cause for insomnia. Pain restless leg syndrome irregularheartbeat and even sleep apnea are a few of the physical problems that maybring on the inability to sleep well. A physician can help with the diagnosisand treatment of these problems.            What can be done to help the person with dementia who wakesat night.             1)            Check to see if toileting is needed. If theperson is able to toilet themselves put a picture of a toilet on the bathroomdoor so they can easily find it.             2)            Make sure the person is physically comfortable:Is the room too hot or too cold? Are there enough blankets and pillows?             3)            Are nightmares or hallucinations bothering theperson? Comfort and reassure them.             4)            Try a gentle back rub             5)            For someone who seems to be disturbed bysleeping alone use a rolled-up blanket or large stuffed animal to put in thebed next to them.            What about medication for sleep?                   As we age our bodies change. Normally weproduce a substance called melatonin which is there to help us sleep. As we getolder we produce less of it and sleep becomes more difficult.    After checking with the physician caregiverscan obtain over-the-counter melatonin and give it about half an hour beforebedtime.                    Since there are side-effects to mostmedications physicians are often reluctant to order sleep medications untilmost of the other steps mentioned above have been tried. The doctor mayconsider drugs ranging from tricyclic antidepressants such as Pamelor orAventyl to traditional sleeping pills. If the person with Alzheimer’s isalready on Aricent    it’s good to knowthat it has been shown to increase oxygen saturation in patients with Alzheimer’srelated sleep disturbances caused by breathing problems at night.                   Caregivers should also be aware that useof sleep medications can also increase the risk of falls in the elderly andprecautions should be taken to make sure there is a night light available andall obstacles have been removed on the path to the bathroom. A bedside commondemay also be helpful at night.                               Stephanie Zeman MSN RN,False,Stephanie Z,2011-12-15,4217.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489381,,,AlzConnected,,,

Looking for meds that work.,I haven't posted here in awhile but I'm looking for some advice.  Mom appears to develop visual hallucinations that progress to include auditory ones and also delusions and it seems like it's just about every 5 months. Last episode lasted about a month.     Any of you have a LO this has happened to?  Anyone find meds that stopped the cycling?  Or do you find the cycles just stop on their own?      She's been on Seroquel at different doses the whole time which has me thinking that it may not be effective yet there have been some other med complications along the way that make this hard to figure out.  We got rid of some Keppra for seizures and Neurontin for pain which made the episode much more severe but nonetheless another one just started two weeks ago and is progressing.     Geriatrician is going to try increasing Seroquel from 50 to 62.5 at night adding 12.5 in morning and keeping 12.5 at noon and see what happens.

(hint it's not just for dying!),"Associated Press article from July 2 2012      Article about hospice today:      With boomers coming hospice industry diversifies      By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press – Jul 2 2012       CONCORD N.H. (AP) — Forget that image of a hospice worker sitting next to a hospital bed in a dimly lit room. Today hospice care is delivered everywhere from the golf course to the casino.     As they brace for the eventual needs of the aging baby boom generation hospice providers are working to diversify their services and dispel misconceptions about what they do.     Chief among those myths is the notion that hospice consists of friendly visitors who sit in a darkened room and hold Grandma's hand while she dies says Robin Stawasz family services director at Southern Tier Hospice and Palliative Care in upstate New York.     ""It's just not what we do. We come in and help people go golfing or go snowbird down to Florida or go out to dinner several nights a week. We help them get to the casinos on weekends"" she said. ""This is not getting ready to die. This is living — living now living tomorrow making the best possible life with what you have.""     According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization an estimated 1.58 million patients received hospice care from more than 5000 programs nationwide in 2010 more than double the number of patients served a decade earlier. More than 40 percent of all deaths in the United States that year were under the care of hospice which provides medical care pain management and emotional and spiritual support to patients with terminal illnesses.     Both figures have grown steadily and are expected to rise as baby boomers — the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 — get older.     ""It's a complicated time and an exciting time but it's also in many ways going to be a very daunting time for hospices to try to find ways to take care of all these people"" said Donald Schumacher president and CEO of the national hospice group.     For the vast majority of patients hospice means periodic visits at home from a team of hospice workers. A much smaller percentage receives continuous nursing care at home or inpatient care at a hospice house.     Hospice is covered under Medicare Medicaid and most private health insurance plans. According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization 84 percent of patients receiving hospice care in 2010 were covered by Medicare. The vast majority of those patients received routine home care — visits from hospice workers as opposed to around-the-clock nursing care or inpatient care — and at that level of care the Medicare reimbursement was about $126 per day according to the organization.     Medicare covers hospice care if a doctor determines someone has less than six months to live and if the patient forgoes any further life-prolonging treatment though under the new federal health care overhaul law it will experiment with covering both curative and supportive care at a number of test sites nationwide.     In the meantime hospice programs are growing in number and scope. Recognizing that people are living longer and with complex illnesses they've been branching out into other ""pre-hospice"" areas for patients who are not terminally ill. For example some centers have become certified as so-called PACE providers an acronym that stands for ""program of all-inclusive care for the elderly.""     ""Hospices are trying to throw a broader net out to provide services to people before they become eligible for hospice"" Schumacher said.     Another trend is focusing on patients with specific diagnoses. While hospices for decades overwhelmingly cared for people with cancer by 2010 cancer diagnoses had dropped to 36 percent of patients served prompting some centers to develop programs geared toward heart disease dementia and other diagnoses.     ""We are realizing that while our roots were really in oncology that model is not the best response for all patients"" Stawasz said. ""We needed to really look again at how we were doing things. It is not a one-size-fits-all kind of treatment plan"" she said.     After working with providers and patients to figure out where traditional hospice had been missing the mark Stawasz's agency launched its specialized program for patients who have suffered heart failure in 2009. While there's usually a clear line between medical treatment and comfort care for cancer patients things get blurry with other conditions she said. So the agency started focusing on the reason behind each service rather than the service itself.     ""If the real focus is to help someone stay comfortable then that's hospice even if it's traditionally something a little bit more aggressive such as IV antibiotics or IV diuretics or that sort of thing or hospitalizations"" she said. ""So if the goal is for comfort and the treatment has a reasonable expectation to provide meaningful comfort then that's hospice.""     Though he praises such programs one expert in end-of-life issues says the hospice industry and American society as a whole are far from ready for the aging baby boom generation. Unless caring for people at the end of life becomes a larger part of the national agenda the rising tide of elders is bound to result in a flood of unmet needs said Dr. Ira Byock director of palliative medicine at New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.     He points out that while the number of people using hospice has grown the average length of stay actually dipped slightly in 2010 compared with the previous year raising concerns that providers aren't reaching patients and their family caregivers in a timely manner.     ""We often quip that in hospice care these days we're doing brink-of-death care rather than end-of-life care"" Byock said.     When it comes to illness dying and death the American mindset is ""I don't want to think about it."" But Byock hopes baby boomers will ""take back"" the end of life in the same way they took charge of the beginning by pushing for the natural childbirth movement and efforts to bring fathers into the delivery room.     ""It was driven by the boomers as citizens and consumers; it was an advocacy movement. A very similar thing needs to happen now"" he said.     Hospice workers say they are more ready than other health care providers to deal with baby boomers and whatever changes health care reform brings because they've been working with limited budgets for years.     ""We've been meeting that triple threat of providing better care with higher patient satisfaction for less money"" Stawasz said. ""I think hospice is perhaps standing as a model for others as we are dealing with the challenges of the increased needs that baby boomers represent.""     Laurie Farmer of the Concord Regional Visiting Nurse Association agrees. And she adds that hospice is all about providing individualized care something that baby boomers likely will demand.     ""The baby boom generation comes as very educated consumers and so we are feeling that we have been meeting that challenge"" she said.     At age 70 Liz Murphy of Deerfield N.H. is a few years older than the oldest baby boomers. But like many of the baby boomers served by the Concord hospice program she did her homework before deciding several weeks ago to move into the program's hospice house.     Murphy a longtime Statehouse lobbyist was found several years ago to have an extremely rare cancer of the connective tissue that settled mainly in her bones but also has spread to her brain liver and other organs. She started considering hospice after a spate of surgeries just weeks apart resulted in no improvements.     Murphy said she knew where the hospice house was but beyond that knew little about it before she started looking into it. But once she did she made her decision quickly.     ""I talked it through with my husband and my children and anybody else who I thought would have an interest in it and I feel as though I got information from as many people as I needed. I came and looked at it and I'm very happy with it"" she said.     ""It's been great. I love the place. I've been very fortunate that the people who are here are people who are happy to work with me and are interested in working together with my family my husband and me to give us the program we're interested in.""     Copyright © 2012 The Associated Press.

Imagine yourself as the duty employee caregiver CNA whatever and the patient goes into near straight line. What are you going to do. Look for a DNR and if you find a DNR try to figure out what parts apply to the diminishing patient.      I have both the standard DNR and the State mandated detailed DNR at my wife's Care Facility. If for some reason my wife's Care Facility phones me and tells me they have done this or done that when signs of final life arose I would accept their actions as doing what they thought best or rather what the duty attending employee thought best at the time final decisions had to be made.      The patient is near death anyway and having them live another few hours days  weeks or months while in a state of severe body health coupled with a mental disease is not life or anything like it.      I have not had my wife as a wife going on 9 years now. The ongoing grief while living alone is not a joy ride; a joy ride neither for my wife nor I. So much pain has passed thru our lives that I cannot recall any of those joyous times shiny eyes laughable moments or periods of a functional marriage any more. I have many photographs of many years ago reflecting various events and occassions. But when I view these photograph of so long ago I see nor feel any pleasantries.   Death at times is a welcome Reaper.      To the opposite if the attending employee decided they could bring my wife back to some form of recognizable life I would not make any rebuttal to the duty employee making that choice at the most intimate moment in the patient's life.

I googled them and discovered that they mainly sell vitamin and herbal supplements as well as diet books and other merchandise. I contacted the companies and had her removed from the mailing lists and I cancelled any further shipments. She got her diet book with a title that indicated whole wheat is bad for you which cost 40.00. One month she spent 200.00 on stuff from these so-called medical catalogs.         About a week ago I was cleaning in her kitchen when I discovered she had a hidden stash of pills on a high shelf in a cupboard. I found a bottle containing Aloe supplements and another with Glucosamine-Chondroitan. Mom keeps her meds on the kitchen counter in plain sight. She tells the doctor that she only takes what's prescribed no supplements etc but I have been suspicious ever since discovering she'd been ordering from these companies. I looked through her meds on the counter and found a half-empty bottle of these Aloe supplements. I also found bottles of ""pain relieving"" creams and gels similar to something like Ben Gay or Icy Hot that can be found OTC but she's shelling out a boatload of money for the catalog orders. Or was until I cancelled them.          One of the concerns I expressed to the doctor on a previous visit was that of Mom's meds; I don't think she's taking them properly but when I offer to help I'm met with resistance. The doctor took my concerns seriously and said that with the loss of memory and impaired judgment people with dementia often become confused about their meds. Mom's eyesight is bad and she could also confuse pills that look similar or have similar names on the bottles. This is one reason she said that Mom can no longer care for herself and recommended Assisted Living.         When Mom moves to the ALF in a week her meds will be given to her by the nursing staff. My concern is: 1) her taking supplements that may not be good for her and 2) her hiding the pills and withholding the fact that she is taking them.        At her doctors appointment yesterday the doctor prepared the forms regarding Mom's admittance to the ALF. She went over the fact that Mom's meds will be administered to her by the staff. I nonchalantly asked if that was only prescriptions or if it included the supplements Mom was taking like Glucosamine and the Aloe Vera. Mom acted uncomfortable and surprised like she had been ""found out"". She just said that the Glucosamine helps her joints and the Aloe gives her 'pep' and makes her ""feel better"".          Since I have stopped shipment from these companies she won't be getting any more supplements from them.

I'm away for a few days helping my daughter with my granddaughter as her sitter is out of town this week. My mom was doing pretty good since coming out of the hospital and being on iv antibiotics for 4 days while hospitalized so I thought it would be ok...and medically I think it is.     Mom has been calling me every day and seemed ok. My daughter sent the interferring cousin a text message telling her that *I* have been the one taking care of my mom because I'm the only one who knows all of my mom's medical history. Cousin never responded but today my mom called and left a nasty message on my daughters phone (calling her by one of my other daughter's names) saying that cousin has taken as much care of her as anyone else has...ok cousin has  been 1500 miles away and JUST moved back her after 12 years last weekend. What the heck could she have done for her? She knows NOTHING about my mom's medical history and only knows exactly what my mom has told her...which haslf of it she doesn't even know.      That is why every single time my mom has had to go to hospital in last 6 monyhs (probably a total of 15 times) I drop EVERYTHING and go straight there so the hospital staff knows all her history. I know stuff my mom can't even remember.      So sounds like cousin has brainwashed my mom...message my mom left on my daughter's phone also said that the cousin has a letter stating that SHE has been the one taking care of my mom. So obviously cousin went running to my mom saying who knows what...this cousin has ALWAYS been a lying controlling trouble making B****. ALWAYS!!!!

Mom walks talks (but it is babble)...eats 3 meals a day and snacks in between    has learned how to get out of her wheelchair despite two restraints (our AD LO's are pretty smart)    We have taught her to say honk honk when we give her a little signal; she sings happy birthday son and jingle bells and can say ouch.  Other than this I have to guess.  I try to offer her several treats to choose from but she really cant do it so i let her taste it then put it in her hand (the treat or spoon) and if she wants it she will eat it.    My question (sorry for getting a  little off track.    You said your dad said   D    s ""Every vein in my body hurts"" and I realized he was in more pain than we could possibly know because he couldn't articulate it.          Thank goodness he was able to say that.

I worry about each of them. since she was diagnosed I have moved 600 miles away and only get to go home once a year.  To see the change in her from year to year is heart breaking   I not only worry about her but my father also. Her personality has changed and she can be like a child throwing a tantrum when she does not get what she want. So to deal with it as best he can and to minimize the the way she talks to him my father gives her what she want most of the time. For now she has the most problems with her memory but is able to care for her self. She still cooks but I feel she does not need to do this any longer. She forgot what she was doing and burned up the frying pan. My dad states he keeps an eye on her and checks to make sure the burners are off but I know this is not true as he is in another room watching tv.      She has a different problem with her balance with alot of pain in her legs and back due to spurs. She looses her balance and has fallen many times thankfully mostly just lots of brushes and no broken bones. Once when she and my father where out she lost her balance and grabbed for my dad and both went down. My dad now has a bulging disk in his back due to it. She goes to a physical therapist to help with her balance that is when my dad can get her to get out of bed to go. There are times when she refuses to get up and go. She stays up from 2-4 in the morning then there are times she doesnt get up until 4 or 5 in the afternoon.      She is on alot of medications and still manages her own meds. Each week she gets them down and puts them in a daily meds box. She is to tell my dad when she is out for him to reorder them. I worry that she does not take them properly. I know that she was not taking her pain med correctly. When I was home she was complaining that it makes she sick to her stomach. I asked if she takes it with food. The answer was no so each day when she got up and asked my dad to get her one I would tell her no...not until she ate something. She did great this way but I dont know if my dad will hold firm with this since I have left.       On of the things I saw the most change in this last time home was that she seems to know how to answer the right way even if it is a lie.  She as a walker but would not use it. I encouraged her to use it when I was home. Like a child she would lie to you when she is not doing something the right way. We have always been animal lovers and grew up with all kinds of animals. My parents have several dogs in the house. They do not go out to go to the bathroom but have paper down for them.  The dogs go where they want   If you say something about one of them going on the floor she will swear they never do that and will act all surprised and disappointed in them. The last dog she just got a few months ago and I was so upset with my dad for allowing it. He states that he told her she didnt need another dog but then he is the one that took her to get it she does not drive!  I talked to my sister and brother about having someone to come in a clean for them..to at least keep the floors clean. My sister and I each pay to have a lady come in just to clean the floors and the bathrooms twice a month. When I go home I spend the time cleaning and my boyfriend spends the time cooking and stocking the freezer with meals.      Sorry I seem to be rambling now but I am just so worried about my parents.  I dont know what the future holds.  I have tried to get my dad to get in touch with the Counsel on ageing in their town to at least give him some time off every now and then but he refuses. But then my mom would have a fit. He has to be within her eyesight or at least the sound of her voice at all times.   He sneaks off while she is in bed to go to the doctor. I worry that she will wake when he is gone and get hurt or burn the house down.      Thank you all for allowing me to vent.

I have been reading many of the posts with a very heavy heart and I ache for you all. Right now I am in the midst of watching my dear mother slowly slip away before my very eyes.  Mom has been refusing or eating very little now for at least the past three months. She has lost weight does not walk and can no longer stand. She continues to drink but even this has decreased going from 2-3 small cups to about 1 cup at each meal. She is in a nursing home here in Canada. Over the past two weeks or so I have seen a rapid deterioration in that she has pretty much stopped speaking uttering only a yes or no occasionally but pretty much zoned out in her own mental prison.  She has become frail and weak and although they continue to get her up in her chair or wheelchair everyday she must be put back to bed in the afternoon to rest. This change has caused a great deal of anguish within me and although she is not unconscious or sleeping 24/7 I believe my mother will not be with me much longer. I am the only daughter that is involved in my mother's care or really in her life at all. I have two brothers one on physical disability due to a traumatic car accident 5 yrs ago who hasn't seen her since Christmas. He lives about an hour away and states that his pain levels are through the roof and is unable to come see his mom. His wife also has convinced him that since mom's organs aren't ""shutting down"" at this moment that she is not dying and that since she's not walking her appetite is naturally decreased. Yeah ok but I don't see how taking one or two spoonfuls of pudding and then turning away justifies this. My other brother lives about and hour and a half away and unfortunately has a mental illness which prevents him from being actively involved in her care. I brought him down last weekend to see her and he was very distraught at the turn she has taken. My husband tries to help me as he can going to check on mom when I have to work my 12 hr shifts as an RN.   My 3 grown children as much as I've put the pressure on them for the past 2 yrs are very random with their visits probably because they cannot handle seeing Grandma as she is. One of my sons asked me if I'm ""jumping the gun"" in regards to her condition probably because of the rollercoaster ride that is currently taking place. One day she might smile and eat maybe 6-10 bites rather than one or two and then the next day she's refusing most food and meds and seems worse.  I seriously am considering taking some time off of work. We have here what is called a compassionate care leave. This gives you eight weeks off of work with 6 of them paid for through unemployment benefits. The thing is there needs to be a high liklihood that the person will pass during this time. Once the period is over the leave and payments cease. I really feel that I need to be there for her at this time and really can't think of much else. I'm utterly heartbroken and don't know what to do. Any advice and/or support would be greatly appreciated.

She fell back in her wheelchair or that's when I think she hurt herself. She went back on the arm of the chair before falling into the seat. Anyway I was going to get a cushion on Thursday but she insisted that she didn't need it because it was feeling better. She has complained every day since so this morning when the caregiver got here I was going to get a cushion. When I told her I was leaving she said don't leave me and I say the caregiver is here you aren't alone but then the don't drive faster than fifty please don't go I don't need a cushion. I was ugly and said I am leaving and will be back in about an hour maybe a little later. I got into my car and started down the highway called the pharmacy that told me they had them for 9.99 to find out they are inflatable. The prices ranged from 9.99 19.99 to 30.00. When I heard 9.99 I thought I had hit pay gold. I turned around and came home because I have an appointment tomorrow in that town twenty miles away. I thought why am I using my gasoline to do this today when I will go tomorrow and her pain is no worse than it was  yesterday.   I stopped at the post office and in the mail there was a form that mother needed to sign and return. I got home and she was so glad to see me but in the next breath said I hope ........... is careful. I said I am ........... Then I had her sign the form and I started out to mail it while she tells me to be careful. I was ugly and said do you want me to walk? Do you want to go with me? I then said I guess that was being a smartelic and I am sorry. I need to go and get a book to tell me how to react to all this. Most of the time I do maybe okay but like today I just can't be sugar and spice.WHAT!!!! I don't think I am sugar and spice like I once was.

I have 2 folders called Gentle Words 1 &amp; 2 with poems and sayings I found after the loss of my other cat 2 yrs. ago. I have added yours to the colloction. I have one from the collection that has helped me. It is called ""The Last Battle""     It if should be that I grow frail and weak  And pain should keep me from my sleep  Then you will do what must be done  For this--The Last Battle--can't be won.  You will be sad I understand  But don't let grieg stay your hand  For on this day more than the rest  Your love and frienship must stand the test.  We have had so many happy years  You wouldn't want me to suffer so.   When the time comes please let me go.  Take me to where my needs they'll tend  And hold me firm and speak to me  Until my eyes no longer see.  I know in time you will agree  It is a kindness you do to me.  Although my tail its last has waved  From pain  and suffering I have been saved.  Don't grieve that is must be you  Who has to decide this think to do;  We've been  so close--we two--these years  Don't let your heart hold any tears.     It was strange but when I came out of the vets Fri. night it started thundering and lightning and the rain came down. I said to myself it is like heaven is opening its doors to welcome Peaches home.      To Nora Stephanie dayn2night and Iris thank you for your kind words. It still feels so strange not having a cat to feed or fuss over. But time willl heal.     I swore I would not have my knee replacement as long as Peaches was here. I could not board her out for that length of time. Wouldn't be fair to her.  And I could not do ther final think just to get my knee done. I have been in a lot of pain the last several months but plugged along.     But this is strange. I just about made it to the front desk of the hospital with my knee. They sat me in a wheelchair and had somone take me to husband's room. Same when left. But yesterday day after Peaches passing the pain had lessened and I was abler to walk the distance. And it is long. Down one long hall turn into another one and finally come to the elevators. I know I think crazy sometimes but did Peaches take some of my pain with her. It is odd.     I will not be getting any more pets right away. I have to get my knee taken care of first after finding out what is going on with hubby. If he goes to re-hab then maybe after I can put him in Respite care and see how he does. This may be the opening for me to place him in ALF/memory care.      He was quite out of it yesterday. Kept saying he wanted his shoes and socks. But when his supper arrived he did try to feed himself. Of course being scrunched down in the bed it wasn't easy for him. I finally had to help him. The son of the man in the room with him helped him on Fri. when I didn't go which I thought was nice.     I don't know about this Haldol. It seems to be rather strong. I asked the nurse about it and all she said was the doctor ordered it. Since he has a visiting physician coming to the house they do not have hospital priviledges. So it is the hospital doctor. And on a weekend try to get him. Will try again today. I just wasn't up to the ordeal yesterday.      Again thank you for your thoughtfulness.",False,Fluffy,2011-12-05,126.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489268,,,AlzConnected,,,

She goes between thinking she was kidnapped to all kinds of horrible ideas. She is constantly anxious and frantic and is terrified of the people who work there.  Some time last week one of the other dementia patients there told her she didn't stay there and had no place to sleep and no bed and for some reason when nothing else sticks THAT stuck. So here we are a week later and if she's not physically in her bed she thinks she doesn't have one and is freaking out asking over and over again if there is a bed for her.      it's amazing when she can't remember something from 5 minutes ago but she remembers that ONE stupid thing.     My family has been trying and trying to get the geri psych to visit her and prescribe somethign for the anxiety. She is currently on NO meds except for pain.  I think she's been constantly anxious for over a month now (maybe 2? i cant even remember when she fell) - my parents thought the NH would of course direct the doctor to see her when he came and they didn't so then they had to bug them constantly for weeks.     the Geri Psych FINALLY saw Grandma! My parents' very specific request was to prescribe some anti anxiety meds for her.     WHAT A GENIUS!  He sent my parents a report. Guess what the report said!!    After seeing my grandma he has concluded that she has alzheimers and extreme anxiety and is not competent to make any decisions for herself and her medical proxy (my parents with POA) should be making medical decisions for her.     WOW really??? you don't say? I had no idea!  Did he prescribe anything for her to help her extreme anxiety? NO!!  My mom is going to speak with him in 2 days when he's back at the NH and get him to prescribe something. this is beyond frustrating!,False,sharkey,2011-12-21,319.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489050,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is refusing to go for followup with the doctors (psychiatrist) from the hospital and said she refuses to have home health care come into the house.      This is exactly what the doctor and myself were expecting as the doctor said he had to give her one last chance at being independant but he was sure she wouldn't cooperate and would have to be place within 2-3 months.      I've already called (and of course had to leave a message) with adult protective services. At least now I won't have to be the bad guy...if in fact they monitor her as they SHOULD.     She is on her way to 'her' doctor who hasn't done anything to help her during any of this time I've been trying to find answers as to what was going on with her. She is going to him to ask for pain pills...which she has always given to my brother so he could sell them. It's that time of month when she would always give them to him and she doesn't want him mad at her because it's the only time she sees him..      Then they...she and my dad are driving all over 'shopping'. So now I have to call the police again. She asked a couple times about the keys to the truck and I told her I didn't know anything about them and changed the subject...yay me I remembered what to do in a situation like that.      My mom's caseworker just called and said he had been at the house yesterday and nobody was there said he had even gone around looking through the windows. He's supposed to go back today. And he told me the social worker from the hospital had said it was court ordered my mom is to have home health care but wanted me to call to be sure.      I'm sorry to say I have not taken the car.I just don't have the guts to fight with them over that...yet. I realize the possibilities but I keep calling the police when they are out hoping they can be the ones to put a stop to it. There would be absolutely no going back to any civility if I take the car right now. I don't know what else to do there.      Caseworker is going back to the house again...and they aren't going to be there. healthcare aide was supposed to go today too...they aren't going to be there. So now it's becoming a situation where other people will be seeing what's going on other than myself.

She had been bedridden for almost 5 years unable to do anything for herself. I fed her changed her bathed her and tended to all her needs. Was a difficult jorney and took a toll on me physically as well as mentally. I experienced every stage of this horrible disease. Thankfully I was able to keep her at home with me the entire time and had two wonderful caregivers for her while I was at work.  5 years of no more than 3-4hrs of sleep every night. I put my life on hold and focused on very little else. I worried about every little thing but you know...I would gladly do it all over again. I am proud of what I did for her and I know she would have been as well.  This past March she could no longer eat or swallow. I had prayed that it wouldn't get to that stage but I think God put me through it to make it a little easier on me when she passed. It was horrifyinig to watch her waste away. She went 12 days without food or water. It was the most painful agonizing thing I have ever experienced. It tore me up and I didn't think I would be able to get through it. My stomach was a mess for over 2 weeks. On April 12th God came for her. As per my prayers I was by her side when she took her last breath and gave a little smile. She must have seen something wonderful.  My Mama was my world (am an only child) my best friend and the most amazing person I have ever known. I miss her terribly and think of her ALL the time. I take comfort in knowing that she is at peace free from pain able to walk and talk again and I never have to worry about her anymore....she is safe with God.  May God Bless all the caregivers of loved one's and give them the strength to get through each day. I know it takes a special person to care for a parent or loved one. Be proud of what you are doing or what you have done.  I miss you Mama and will always love you with all my heart. I know that you will forever be with me.

She keeps saying she just ate or she's not hungry. Sometimes she says she's nauseous but we think it might be because they have her on the later lunch shift and she's never eaten later than noon her entire life so maybe by 12:30 she's not hungry any more?? She's already lost the 10 lbs she gained at her ALF.  The NH is going to try feeding her at different times and my mom told them to try red plates but this is scaring me.  I know they have tried treats and ice cream and chocolate milk (her favorite) and shes just not hungry.  They want to put a feeding tube in her!  Is this normal?  I thought feeding tubes were for when someone can't swallow. She swallows just fine and was eating really well until she fell and broke her arm.   I have a feeling it would be something she would just yank out anyway.  Grandma never discussed what her wishes would be for this sort of thing with us when she was well.  The thought of them putting one in has totally freaked me out. Can anyone tell me about feeding tubes?  If they don't put one in is she gonna starve to death? Is there a better way of getting her to eat? They are really concerned about her getting dehydrated.    why wont she eat???? she's otherwise just fine aside from the broken arm (and alzheimers of course).  I""m wondering if she's on any pain meds (I don't know what she's on if anything) there that maybe that's doing it but this is going on a few weeks of her barely/not eating already.",False,sharkey,2011-12-21,319.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147488889,,,AlzConnected,,,

She's on 10 mg a day which is half the normal dose. She's been on it almost 2 years for a long time she was on 20 mg but had a ton of medication side effects from other seizure and pain meds (psych issues) for almost a year so this was one of the meds that was cut back before we knew what the problem was. She finally got stablized about 3 months ago when some seizure and pain meds were stopped and Depakote was added in. She was at 10 mg of Namenda then and has been since then.  I've been rejoicing in the major improvement(though not completely perfect) but now I'm seeing her memory worsen and she gets upset about it sometimes.  Part of me is terrified to even make another med change to upset this delicate system of hers but I'm also having trouble seeing her slip and feel helpless in being able to do anything for her.         (Am focusing on exercise and massage for pain issues and she has a lot of activities in the nursing home so a good part of the time her spirits are good and she is distracted...)     I know there are mixed reviews about the effectiveness of these memory meds but has anyone had improvement by increasing a dose back up?  Anything else nutritionally or otherwise that can help her?,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147489144,,,AlzConnected,,,

The investigators also found that those who experienced delirium which is a state of heightened confusion or unusual mood or behavior while in the hospital were even less likely to go back to the way things were after hospital discharge.  For the study researchers followed nearly 800 people with mild Alzheimer's disease about half of whom went to the hospital over the course of the study period due to falls infections or other problems. Being hospitalized was associated with nearly twice the likelihood of having a poor outcome including mental decline and death and being delirious while hospitalized increased the risk by about 12 percent.  The study was published in the June 19 online issue of  Annals of Internal Medicine .  Previous research found that hospitalization and delirium can speed mental slipping in older adults and patients with Alzheimer's but the current study is the first to dissect the risks associated with having delirium on top of being hospitalized on outcomes including institutionalization and death according to background information in the study.  ""Delirium can be quite a problem for patients even with mild Alzheimer's disease and preventing it may be a more effective treatment strategy than the current medications"" said Dr. Tamara Fong an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study.  A number of steps can help prevent delirium in hospitalized patients such as visiting with a family member or a familiar person having eyeglasses or hearing aids available getting out of bed for walks and not taking medications such as painkillers that can worsen confusion.  ""There are some people who advocate keeping older people out of the hospital and treating them at home. This is an interesting [idea] because it does reduce the chance of delirium and reduces health care costs in other ways"" Fong said.  People with Alzheimer's disease are three times as likely to spend time in the hospital. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of Alzheimer's patients are hospitalized each year for an average of about four days the study authors noted.  The current study included 771 patients with mild Alzheimer's enrolled at Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center where they were regularly evaluated for neurological function. Most of the patients were either living on their own or with family.  Among this group 367 patients were hospitalized within 18 months of a research center visit and 194 of these patients had delirium during hospitalization. Delirium was the reason for hospitalization in only 4 percent of cases; the most common causes were fainting falls heart problems and abdominal pain.  The study authors found that 41 percent of the patients who were hospitalized with delirium had accelerated mental decline during the year following hospitalization which they measured using a memory and concentration test. In comparison only 23 percent of hospitalized patients without delirium and 26 percent of patients who were not hospitalized experienced increased mental decline during this time.  Whereas hospitalization on its own did not appear to drive up the risk of mental decline delirium among patients who were hospitalized increased the risk by 20 percent.  Most Alzheimer's patients eventually have to be institutionalized and many of them need help within five to 10 years of diagnosis Fong said. Patients live between eight and 10 years on average after being diagnosed and as Fong pointed out usually die because of complications such as pneumonia.  In this study the risk of going into a nursing home and dying in the year following hospitalization was higher for both groups of hospitalized patients. Those who developed delirium were 9.3 times more likely than nonhospitalized patients to be institutionalized and 5.4 times more likely to die while those who were hospitalized and did not have delirium were 6.9 and 4.7 times more likely respectively.  The researchers took into account the fact that hospitalized patients were generally older and sicker than patients who did not have to go to the hospital during the study.  However the fact that the study involved only one research center and that the participants were predominantly white makes it harder to say the outcomes associated with hospitalization and delirium could apply to the overall population Fong said.  ""This study does a great job of saying 'Look how serious this problem really is'"" said Dr. James Galvin a professor of neurology and psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.  ""Hospitalization is often the tipping point"" he added. ""The medical condition which may lead to hospitalizing may be a tipping point but clearly the hospital can be too.""  There is now a lot of focus on improving health in the home setting to avoid hospitalization and delirium Galvin said.

Sometimes when I go to see her she lights up excitedly as if she recognizes me and other times she looks at me with a blank stare.  I recently asked her who I was and she looked me over and said matter-of-factly “You’re a woman.”      Crushed I told her I was her daughter. She looked puzzled as if she were trying to place me but just couldn’t.          Conversely – not often enough – there are those uplifting times when she blurts out my name and pats my face. I savor these moments thankful that she still has a sense of me.  I realize that Mom is moving deeper into the late stages of Alzheimer’s disease and I am trying to relish what is cognitively left of her but dreading what is to come.         The rate of progression in late-stage Alzheimer’s varies widely. I’ve seen it last weeks and I’ve seen it last many years.  To help us navigate through the final heartbreaking level of this disease I have started palliative care for Mom.    Palliative means to alleviate pain or ease discomfort that interferes with the quality of life for a condition that cannot be cured.  Palliative medicine is a consultant service provided by clinicians with specialized training to provide expert care for people with serious life-limiting or life-threatening illnesses. The clinicians work in collaboration with primary care physicians to enhance overall care.          When I met Tawana Dickinson the palliative medicine nurse practitioner assigned to Mom I immediately was relieved and knew I had an ally to guide me through territory both unfamiliar and overwhelming.  I asked her how palliative care could help Mom.         “Palliative medicine can help facilitate discussions regarding Rose’s changes in condition that may impact goals of care” said Dickinson. “It will also be beneficial for her by helping to manage any symptom needs related to her illness such as anxiety agitation delirium insomnia and pain.  “The goal for Rose is to make every day remaining the best it can be. Throughout her journey palliative medicine is available to make any adjustments and/or recommendations to ensure her comfort for her best quality of life.”          Dickinson explained the details of the living will I needed to complete for Mom so I could make educated decisions on the types of medical treatments and life-sustaining measures I thought Mom would want or not want such as mechanical breathing – respiration and ventilation – tube feeding or resuscitation.         As a caregiver one of the issues I have struggled with is Mom’s medication.    Having been very healthy Mom wasn’t on any medication until her Alzheimer’s diagnosis a few years ago.  Now she takes pills for agitation anxiety depression blood pressure seizures and the pain she has from arthritis degenerative disc disease and polymyalgia.  With Mom not being able to communicate effectively it’s been difficult to assess what the optimum doses are that help her symptoms abate without over-medicating her.  Dickinson went over all of Mom’s medications with me and offered advice on some that could be discontinued and also better ways to manage her pain. She acted as a liaison with Mom’s doctor on these matters and I already have noticed improvements in Mom’s physical and emotional health since these changes.          Dickinson explained that palliative medicine will help me by providing the practical suggestions and emotional support I will need to be better equipped to make decisions about Mom’s care.  “While our health care system is very good at doing things to a person like Rose it is essential that the goal for all medicines tests or therapies are to do something for her.  “With an understanding of the likely disease progression and clearly defined goals of care for Rose you will be better able to make choices and to reduce stressors that can sometimes develop when one is the caregiver.”         I am determined to give my mother the dignity and quality of life she deserves right now and to help her die as consciously as she has lived.  And I am grateful for Dickinson being yet another angel put on the path of our long goodbye.

Two weeks ago we carried her to a poditrist(sp) and he trimmed the toenail that was growing up and trimmed all her toe nails.

I even called the home health nurse that is on call and she said to elevate it and give her some ibuprofin. I gave her one ibuprofin and her foot is elevated. My chest is hurting or so it seems to be. I think from nerves. The caregiver came in and said she should have been taken to the doctor long ago. I thought WHAT??????

My mom has been diagnosed with Alzheimers and Parkinson's.  She has had two back surgeries in the last couple of years and with the most recent one the bone didn't fuse.  (yet)    I am not her main caregiver my step-dad is.  My mom is a lot of pain and the pain medicine is creating havoc with her Alzheimers.  She is confused has hallucinations angry then cries -- she is really all over the charts.  It is hard to tell what is due to her illness and the side effects of the meds.    She calls me (and my brother and sister (we all leave at least an hour away and run our own businesses) and tells us if we love her we will find out what is really going on.  I know it is a catch 22 with the meds but we're having a difficult time dealing with her asking us to help her.  She says my step-dad is trying to going her.  She doesn't trust he is giving her her medications correctly.  While we know that he would never hurt her -- we also know that he gives her ""extra"" pain meds if she is screaming she needs them -- which of course makes the hallucinations paranoia etc worse.  He doesn't always check with the doctor before giving her certain meds or taking them away.  He doesn't always accurately remember what the doctor says either --which is why I am going to all the doctor appointments with them.    Asking him questions about her meds or suggesting he call the doctor leads to him being very defensive and being angry with me.  I am not trying to question him from a stand-point of him doing it wrong really -- just trying to help him keep it straight because his memory can be questionable.    When I tell my step-dad what is happening -- thinking that by doing this he will understand how she is feeling -- his response is that she doesn't do that with him therefore it is not something to be concerned about -- it is just her illness.      She tells me she just has to do what she is told anymore -- it doesn't matter what she wants.      It seems he is treating her like she is already gone and her opinions about her own health and care don't even count.       I am not sure how to deal with being in this triangle of my step-dad telling me to stay out of it that he is taking care of her.  They have been married for 38 years and he and I haven't always had the best relationship.  Then I have my mom calling me asking me to help her -- please research my meds and call my doctor -- I am being drugged.  I don't like feeling this way and I need you to help me.    How do I support &amp; help take care of my mom (when I have no control) keep my step-dad from being mad and keep my sanity at the same time?      Thank you in advance for for any direction or guidance you can provide.",False,D'sDaughter,2012-05-16,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147488323,,,AlzConnected,,,

How can I help her?,Hi      Over the last week or so my mom has reported that the walls seem to be changing color and that it's really bothering her. I believe she's seeing shadows and reflections from other things in the room but is confused by what she sees somehow.  It's not just her room but anywhere she seems to be. She says it's especially bad tho in her room and she has trouble sleeping at night. (nursing home) Sounds like she's seeing what is there but it's distorted somehow in her perception.      Are there things I can do and/or say to help her deal with this better? She's bringing it up several times a day and I feel bad for her. Much of the time she is okay sweet and funny but it still comes up a lot. This also coincides with an increase in pain and being hot and she's complaining about that too.      She's had two previous episodes sort of similar to this so I'm a bit nervous- one was psych related 7 years ago (she's now on low dose of Seroquel) and also this past January. The latest one resolved when she was taken off a few meds and got treated for a uti. She also has mild macular degeneration and slight cataracts but In January her eye doc thought her dementia or her brain was the problem not her eyes.      Her meds haven't changed for the last 10 weeks and up until last week she was doing fantastic!  She's also had so many medication reactions in the past that I'm reluctant to make any more changes and who even knows what the right changes would be? The only thing that changed was her nutrition drinks were stopped because her eating got much much better.. Could that have something to do with it?? Lack of potassium or some minerals? She also completed  her physical therapy which she loves in early May.      I've tried telling her that I see shadows too but it doesn't quite help I also told her it might be related to her cataracts ( even tho doc said no) and now she wants to research vitamins that might help.      Any ideas would be appreciated.

I have thought of rationing out paper to her but what if she needs more? I had to unclog the toilet this morning. If my hubby finds the toilet clogged ( twice ) he raises such a fuss and tells me ""we don't have the money if it breaks!"" It's usually nothing a plunger can't fix and we've gone through a roll of paper since last night. I bought Scott brand because it's one ply and thinner which will help it break down easier  when we were using charmin the rolls were just going 4 a day and the toilet was always almost getting clogged. I love my mom but I just can't go in there every single time and watch her poop. Sometimes I think she goes to the bathroom just to go for something to do or she is misinterpreting her urges. She sits and sometimes strains as if she's willing herself to go like she doesn't even need to. Then she wipes and is done. But she'll keep asking again and again for more toilet paper. I have been giving her 1 or 2 stool softeners every other day and added prunes to her diet. She's not constipated like she was but the straining she is doing trying to go all the time is really taking its toll on me I just don't know what to do about her obsession/want to go to the bathroom! sometimes she'll have just come out of the bathroom and 5 mins later she comes into my room pulling at the back of her pants saying ""I have to go to the bathroom"". I try to tell her ( I don;t know why I try to reason with her I am trying to break this habit but its hard I guess its for my own sanity really ) ""Mom you just got out of the bathroom don't force yourself to go"" she'll tell me ""no but I only just went a little bit I need to go""   I have a neurologist visit June 4th and seeing geriatric doctor June 7th. I dunno what to bring up with them. Mom still can express pain she knows when she hurts like when I clip her toe nail and get too close to the skin or she bumps her elbow in the shower she has no pain when she pees and her behavior has been  ""normal"" in terms of her usual self...I may have them do a 2 day culture when we go to geriatric doctor. Everytime we're there though suddenly she does not need to go or we go and she just poops *siiiiiiiigh*  In the meantime I'm tempted to just ration out her paper  or go with her to the bathroom 15 times a day.

Things were going so well...till Saturday.  I was out for the day had a sitter for mom.  Got home and saw that her right cheek was a little swelled gave her one of her meds and saw a white spot on her tongue.  Off to the ER!       They did all the xrays except the abdomin and only thing that showed up was severe arthritis.  But the white on her tongue is Thrush.  The rash on her chin is Shingles explaining the shooting pain in her head she had for 3 days.  She has a UTI and a small amount of fluid on her right lung.  She's on a whole bunch of meds now.      She's slept most of the time since we got home Saturday till this afternoon.  A little yesterday and now since about 6 pm tonight she's just been babbling.  She's saying real words but not in any order to make any sense.  She's wanting to go home now and nothing I can do or say satisfies her.  Even when she does fall asleep for a few minutes she is talking moving her arms and legs around.       She had a slight fever 1st time since all this started  when the nurse was here today so I've been checking it all night.  It was the same till about 8 and it was 100 so I gave her Tylenol. Checked it again and it's down to around 98.        She don't understand anything that's going on asking over and over.  Don't want to take all the new meds 2 of which are just huge so I'm going to crush them up and put them in applesauce from now on.  She might not get the whole dose but at lease they'll go down.  One came back up so many times she got mad and just chewed it up!  yuck!!!  Before I could put the pill in her mouth and she'd take a drink.  Now I put the pill in her mouth and she just looks at me like now what?  Every time I have to tell her exactly what to do.  When I gave her the Tylenol 1 went down ok 2nd one she just kept looking at me I told her over and over it's a pill take a drink and swallow it.  She just stared at me and chewed it up.       I'm not handling this so well I'm freakin helpless.  And of course 2nd guessing myself even tho several people have told me none of this is my fault.  But I should have known she had shingles.  I had it about 2 years ago pain first then a rash.  But I was thinking sinus infection since she's been coughing/sneezing so much lately she has always had sinus problems. It's on her face too her bottom hip his real swelled.   And I thought the Thrush was cause I don't push her to brush her teeth but the ER dr. nurse and her reg Dr all have said no.       This has got to start getting better or I""m seriously thinking of getting live in help.  I can't even run to town like the other day when the Dr. called in meds for her.  I have to go thru the struggle of getting her in the car so I can take her with me.  I've added 8 hrs on Saturdays now so I can go to the car shows along with the 2 days during the week I have for 3 hrs.       ok now I""m just babbling so I'm done for now.",False,cb55,2012-04-06,67.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147488441,,,AlzConnected,,,

She does NOT take that many of them.      She has been getting 120 vicodin per month for over a year. She keeps 20 then gives the other 100 to my brother to sell. I've come to the conclusion she is doing this only because the ONLY time he talks to her or comes around is to get those pills. That is her only tie to him and she doesn't want to lose it. It makes me sick in so many ways. #1 is because my brother could care less about her...just the money he can get from the pills. He told me a couple years ago when I was having problems with my mom and went to him to ask for help that it wasn't his business wasn't his problem...referring to OUR mom. #2 reason this all makes me so sick is because my son is addicted to prescription pain meds and has moved on to shooting up morphine...so my mom (and my brother) knows the effects these nasty pills have had on our own family...and here they are contributing to some other family.      Then my mom fractured a vertebra in her back in a fall a few months ago and since she'd given her vidodin away she had nothing for pain so went to her GP and told him the vicodin wasn't working and he ended up giving her morphine...which my son ended up stealing from her and she was still without. Except she really didn't even realize they were gone because even though she had fractured the vertebrae she still was not using any pain meds.      I've informed GP what was going on with the narcotics and he refuses to prescribe any more for her. Today she begged cried and yelled at GP because he doesn't know the kind of pain she's in. He HAS been giving her fentynol patches which she claims does not work. I asked him if maybe she doesn't believe they're working because her brain doesn't feel the same sensation as when she uses the oral meds...he agreed.      She got so angry that she stormed out of the office because he would not give her something 'stronger' for pain. She does not have that degree of pain. If she did she would not have been giving away the vicodin and she would have realized the morphine was gone when she needed it and it wasn't there. I just don't know what she really wants...other than using those pills to keep from losing my brother.      She treated me like crap at the GP's office today. She will complain that nobody helps her with anything yet when I do anything to help her she complains about how its done when it's done etc. Today when the GP wrote out her prescription for a stronger pain patch I told her I would go the 20 miles to pick it up because I was going to that town anyways...which I'd already told her before the appointment so she knew I wasn't just making it up.

But she'll be left handed the rest of her life basically.  She can extend her arm fine but can't bend it up enough to feed herself.  She does ok left handed but makes a mess most of the time. It's because of that one pin that came out that let the bone spread so it doesn't totally fit in the socket. When she bends it it hits on the bone.       And now 3 fingers on the hand that the arm was broke don't work. She can make a fist but they won't straighten out.  Dr had never seen it before in just a 2 week period he called in another Dr and she'd never seen it either.  Could get Botox which would relax them but she still wouldn't be able to use them.  Can't use muscle relaxers with Seroquel. Going to try massage but she won't let me do it but she'll let the sitters do it.       Visiting Dr. upped her Seroquel and all the other ""symptoms"" she was having are gone except the leg spasms. The ""everything is tight"" thing back pain stomach pain picking at things.  They just called and said give it another couple of weeks and the leg spasms should go away too.       She can hardly walk cause she said her knees hurt I have to move the commode just 2 steps away now or she won't make it.   They're thinking that might go away too.  If not they'll do an xray to see what is going on not they'll we'll be able to do anything to fix whatever they do find.  I have a call into the PT also.  I stopped the exercises when all this started  thinking it was making it worse and now not sure if I should start them back up again.       This is SO FREAKIN hard to watch my mom go thru all this and not understand/remember any of it.  Every day several times a day she wants to know what's wrong with her fingers and why I haven't taken her to a Dr for it.  I tell her we went and this is what you need to do she don't believe me. She even thinks I didn't take her to have her arm fixed when it was broke.       I'm still going after the Dr for what he did but have found out he has dropped off the face of the planet.  Not working any where anymore.  If I can't find a way to contact him none of these places can continue with their investigations.  I'm still going to call a couple more lawyers too but if he can't be found not sure what they can do either now.",False,cb55,2012-04-06,67.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147488244,,,AlzConnected,,,

The short sale has gone through on the house and we have until the end of May to find a house and move.     MIL has gotten worse. She's in a geri- chair and hospital bed. Last Thursday she fell out of the bed she crawled to the foot and fell out. Hitting her head on the corner of the table and getting herself a nice golf ball sized lump. She is OK no different than usual. She can barely walk it's more of me holding her upper arms and pushing her. She can't stand or walk unassisted. She can't feed herself at all anymore not even finger foods. She has a blank look on her face reaches for stuff in the air that aren't there. Holds her finger like she's holding something and then tries to put it in her mouth or on the floor. Unbuttons her shirt and tries to take it off.     Hubby is working two jobs here now to make ends meet. I hardly see him anymore. A few minutes in the morning while he's getting ready for work and a couple hours at night when he gets home showers eats and usually goes right to bed before 9.     Taking care of MIL trying to find a house to rent for 5 people and 7 animals (I only tell them about the 2 dogs the 3 cats hide most of the time and the other two animals are in aquariums.) is getting harder and harder. With all the people here loosing their homes the rental market is slim. And the prices are too high. On top of all that trying to get my doctor appts for my back (going to a pain specialist now) and the tests they want me to do is tiring. My brain is mush all this stuff bouncing around in my head. I can't sleep at night half the time. Doctor appts house viewing appts hospice nurse visits bath aides caring for MIL the animals the family. Plastic wrap is thicker than I am right now.     Thanks for letting me vent.

But I can hear Mom saying ""don't worry about it"" or ""don't feel bad"". But I do.   I don't know what's wrong with me. I kept hearing about MOther's Day but just didn't make association with the flowers. So unlike me.     My mind doesn't seem to function well anymore. Thought I was getting AD but doctor says it's all from stress.      Husband is really starring to get one my nerves. Keeps saying over and over All done Mom or what do I do now. Even as soon as he gets home from daycare it's ""What do I do"". Then I guess because his hearing is getting even worse he is talking so loud.Heck I can't even go to the bathroom without him calling me. I just let him call for no matter how loud I answer he doesn't hear. Then he falls asleep for awhile wakes up and whole thing starts over until he dozes off again.     Got the mess cleaned up on Tues. from the substitute aide overflowing the toilet. Had to take part of the carpet up in bedroom that got wet and rugs from basement put outside to dry. Everything back in order now. Was so tired after that did not feel like cooking supper so got a tuna fish sub. Did breakfast dishes up and finally went in and sat down to watch TV.      Was dozing slightly and heard a strange yet familiar noise. At first thought it was husband doing something but then  realized it was the sound of cats claws in the carpet. I looked over and here was my cat crawling dragging her back legs trying to get to me for her evening petting session. She had pulled herself about 20 ft. from spare bedroom where she likes to sleep. I picked her up and held her petting her our usual evening routine. The put her down and she was still dragging her back legs. She is 16 and has very severe arthritis. Almost every joint in her body is affected. She had ligaments in both back legs replaced few years ago so they are the worst and her spine by her tail.      I cvalled the critical care vet and told them I was on the way. Told husband he's have to stay by himself and off I went. They seemed to think it is a worsening of her arthritis in back legs. Said to wait couple days and see what happens. Everyone there just loves her. When I walk in they all say Hi Peaches. She is on 3 pain meds and there isn't much elsre to give a cat. Cats are difficultn to treat for pain on long term basis. Their system doesn't handle them well.     It seemed so strange. Tues. morning was walking evening this happened. Thurs. she did get up and walk some but not in her usual way. I have 2 vets involved and they are leaning to a disc problem. One possibly slipped and is pressing on nerves. Butn with her age and extensive arthritis would not be a candidate for surgery.      This is so difficult. Had three other cats but they had illnesses and youn just knew when it was time. But Peaches still has a good appetite too good. I go in the bedroom she sticks her head out from under the bed and gives me a little squeek.  She isn't meowing in pain. That's what makes it so hard. But don't want her to    suffer needlessly.     All the while husband is such a great help. Always needing attention. If I'm not in the room with him he starts calling for me. I can't have any peace.     Then I can't find my car keys. Went grocery shopping Fri. and I usually drop keys on dining room table and put them in pocketbook later. With everything going on didn't think about them. Yesterday wanted to go out and couldn't find them. I still can't. Think husband took therm and goodness knows what he did with them. Thisn happened once before andf when I took his shoes off at bedtime they were i  his shoe.  Don't ask me how he could have his foot in shoe with all the keys. But no luck this time.      To top it all off I got a phone call saying they were from Windows Systems Clear.  That there was a problem with a lot of junk mail and spam or whatever going around and they wanted to update my computer. I should have known better but wasn't thinking right away. They had me put my address and email on  form then asked what level of protectio  I wanted and how was In going to pay for it? Ding a bell went off in my head. Microsoft doesn't call you on the phone. So I gave this person an excuse that I couldn't finish right now. They kept typing on the screen are you ready yet? I n the meantime I called Microsoft and they said they never call anyone and they had not heard of this Windows Systems.      Then the phone rings again and they want to know if I'm ready yet. I said I don't know who you are but Microsoft does not call people. If there is such a problem I can be notified over an alert on computer. Good-bye. But now I'm worried that they have my address and email address. Just glad I didn't put my debit card number in. That's what finally woke me up whe n they asked for that. Stupid me.     Now I have to go out and cut the vines that are growing over fence from neighbors. They are almost to our driveway. They don't do anything. One time I mentioned nicely to him that you have a mess of vines back there (alongside his garage). He walked over looked and said well I don't see them. From his back door you can't. But now they are out front. Why do I always have to be doing other people's work?  I have enough of my own to do. But right now am just worried about my cat.     Sorry for being so long winded.",False,Fluffy,2011-12-05,126.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147488224,,,AlzConnected,,,

Many Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available over the counter such as ibuprofen Tylenol and naproxen and as prescriptions.  They are commonly used for pain relief.

All end-of-life decisions should respect my values and wishes while maintaining comfort and dignity. I want to be pain free and comfortable at the end of life.  It is not my intent to authorize affirmative or deliberate acts or omissions to shorten my life rather only to permit the natural process of dying.  I want to avoid life-prolonging interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) kidney dialysis or breathing machines. My health care proxy is to direct my physician or hospitalist to sign a do not resuscitate (DNR) order and place it in my medical chart.  The following are my six (6) wishes: IF:  [1] If I have a terminal condition as determined by my attending physician and confirmed by a second qualified physician it is my desire that my dying not be prolonged by administration of death-prolonging procedures. My attending physician is to withhold or withdraw medical procedures that merely prolong the dying process  [2] If my terminal condition is an incurable and irreversible condition that even with the administration of life-sustaining treatment will in the opinion of the attending physician and another physician result in death within six (6) months. Or I am persistently unconscious in which thought and awareness of self and environment are absent:  [3] If I have an end-stage condition that is a condition caused by injury disease or illness which results in severe and permanent deterioration indicated by incompetency and complete physical dependency for which treatment of the irreversible condition would be medically ineffective:  [4] If I am permanently unconscious and there is no reasonable possibility that I will return to a cognitive or sapient life and shall include but not be limited to a persistent vegetative state) as determined by my attending physician and confirmed by a second qualified physician:  [5]If I have a serious irreversible illness or condition and the likely risks and burdens associated with the medical intervention to be withheld or withdrawn may reasonably be judged to outweigh likely benefits to me from such intervention  [6] If my quality of life is unacceptable to me because of the following conditions {a b &amp; c}. {a} Permanent unconscious condition: I become totally unaware of people or surroundings with little chance of ever waking up from the coma. {b} Permanent confusion: I become unable to remember understand or make decisions.

I DO NOT want treatment of new conditions including resulting in unacceptable quality of life.  Then: I direct that I be given health care treatment to relieve pain or provide comfort even if such treatment might shorten my life suppress my appetite or my breathing or be habit forming.  I direct that all medical treatment be limited to measures to provide comfort and to relieve pain and authorize the administration of pain relieving drugs even if their administration may hasten the moment of my death.  I direct ff the Life Sustaining Treatment is experimental and not a proven therapy or is likely to be ineffective or futile in prolonging life or is likely to merely prolong an imminent dying process including use of surgery blood transfusions or antibiotics that will deal with a new condition but will not help the main illness; such therapy and treatment shall not be used.  I direct that my life NOT be extended by artificially administered nutrition and hydration. I DO NOT want tube feedings to be given.  I direct my health care proxy person(s) to make health care decisions for me including: decisions to accept or refuse any treatment service or procedure; decisions to provide withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments and artificial nutrition and hydration; and decisions regarding organ donation burial arrangements and autopsy:  If any of the above conditions exist my attending physician is to withhold or withdraw medical procedures that merely prolong the dying process  This statement is made after careful consideration and is in accordance with my strong convictions and beliefs.

1540,6210d5d97b65de9a5b68589e,2147487664,2012-04-23 14:27:00,Advice on whether almost 86 mom should have colonoscopy w history of large polyps,Hi All     Now that mom seems to have gotten through some serious medication issues there's been time to think about other health matters.     In 2008( I believe it was then..) she had a colonoscopy where they removed a large polyp that I was told probably would have become cancerous if we had waited much larger. She is supposed to have another colonoscopy by 2013.      I'm nervous about doing it because of effects of the sedation med Versed I believe. Her mental state is so amazingly good right now that I'm scared to have her take anything that could upset this balance. She tolerated the Versed in 2008 and also in March 2011 when she had an endoscopy.  However you never know if there is some kind of cumulative effect with the sedation meds on other things she's taking.  In mid April 2011 she had a sort of anxiety issue while she was still on some of her bad medications so I don't know if the Versed perhaps could have had something to do with it or not.  She's also almost 86 and that alone is something to think about.      On the other hand I'm afraid to not have the colonoscopy given the polyp history. Certainly it would be desirable to get anything out that might be bad so we wouldn't have to worry about something developing like colon cancer. I know we'd never put mom thru chemo etc. Mom has elevated blood pressure but not on meds hypothyroidism which is managed and vascular dementia in early to mid stages. She's pretty high functioning still...     So my thought had been to give mom at least 6 good months with no med changes and then consider this procedure. We also have to think about a possible oral surgery issue too..( so far she has no pain just reports from the dentist of a decayed tooth so I'm in no hurry right now to do anything about it.)     Anyways it was on my mind so I wanted to ask. What do you all think about this?     Thanks for your help!,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147487664,,,AlzConnected,,,

She seemed bitter about her upcoming wedding and her grandmother who is in an expensive care facility and may not be attending the event. The author questioned the cost of care and whether it was an appropriate use of ""the inheritance.""    I found this on the Internet after just a brief search:    ""The average annual cost of a private room in a U.S. nursing home has increased to $77745 this year [2011] up 3.4% from the 2010 average.    Analysts at Genworth Financial Inc. Richmond Va. (NYSE:GNW) have published those figures in a summary of results from a survey of 15500 long term care providers in 437 regions throughout the United States.""    So $100000 per year for a memory care unit one of the facilities with more amenities is not out of line at $100000 I believe.    Yes it is a lot of money but for those who have the resources it may be the best route. Our loved ones worked and saved all their lives concerned about not being a burden to anyone in the future. No matter what they may have promised no matter how a will is drawn up to disburse funds following their demise our loved ones do not OWE us anything. They have the right to deplete their own resources for their own care and none of us should be counting on receiving any of those funds.

I hate the process of finding someone that fits in with mother and the ones we have mother is used to and I think that is why I am so  slow or maybe I am just slowed down doing much of anything.   One caregiver that had the breast issues I truly think is never coming back but she will not call or even text me. I was feeling so sorry for her didn't want to throw her under the bus but shouldn't she respond to a text if I can't reach her by phone? I am thinking she is probably so distressed that she isn't even thinking about this job. Should I hire someone in her place without even talking to her first but again she hasn't responded to my text so how can I communicate.....She was the Thurs/Fri day and Sun/Mon night person so I have been doing most of those days and the other night person is working seven nights a week.   So I found someone that has worked a total of six of those days during this month that the sick one used to work. This lady that filled in knows how to handle mother and I have even asked if she would consider taking these days but she can't commit at this time. She worked yesterday and told me she could probably work next Thurs/Fri too but it is still in the air if she can work next week or not and she will let me know. I just want to know if she is going to help me next week or not. I am left hanging once again.   I HATE to use an agency because of the bigger cost and I am trying to pinch coins because this is 24/7 plus the house expenses and etc adds up and fast. Just today the sick ones friend that has been working weekend days calls at almost seven to say she has a sick baby and will be in when she gets her settled down. I ask what time do you think that will be and she said it shouldn't be too much later. It is now an hour past the time she should have been here so I wonder what not too much later means to her. Last weekend she was off going to a sandcastle event.  I have another lady that tells me she would work weekend days but I would have to pay her two dollars  more per hour than this girl that is working now but I could probably depend on her being here every weekend UNLESS it is a holiday and she doesn't work on holidays. It seems that everyone that I have either called or has called me has their own agenda about when they will work. People want the pay and they want it on their terms. WOW when I worked at my job I was there when they told me they needed me.   Oh the Sat/Sun person just called to tell me if her baby's temp got above 102 she would have to take her in to the ER and she would call later to tell me is she was coming in or not. I told her just not to come because if she had to take her in to the ER she wouldn't be here. I thought I don't want to wishy washy around and wait for your call and then I even thought she will bring that germ into this house too. She told me she would be here tomorrow. DUHHHHHHHHHHH her baby is sick today and she will be here tomorrow.   I think another thing that has me so down is this is the first time in many many years that my small town of 2000 is having a festival  from ten until six. I had almost signed up to have a vendor booth that would have costs fifty dollars so I could sell some children's things but decided with my luck I shouldn't and thank goodness I didn't because of this NO SHOW SICK BABY. I had planned to go early while someone was here with mother just to look around and see what the over fifty vendors had and just to get out for a moment but now that plan has vanished like my money does each month.  I guess I will read about it in the paper. I did get up early and drove around the square this morning at seven while the night person was still here and saw a few of the vendors getting their canopies up. Some day I will be able to go but will I be able by then.   I am sick myself with a kidney infection and upper back/neck/shoulder pain. I have also been dealing with an eye infection probably just allergy but still I looked at it this morning and it looks a little better.   Oh and the caregiver that works M-W and is dependable that was going to come in for a little while Thurs. called to tell me she had shoulder pain so she didn't come to help. Do you hear me crying UNCLE????   I even broke down and cried in front of my mother when I took her to the potty just a little while ago. She woke up with a headache and I told her we had no one coming this day and she had to try to push herself up out of the chair to help me as much as she could.

First he changed the time with my sister when she was coming with her kids.  Then he left.  When he came back from Mass I told him he could go to get something to eat.       So I missed Mass.  ok I'll go later.     My mom got into bed about 10:30.  She didn't sleep well because it can be noisy in the hallway.  She did nap though.  If she weren't sleepy she'd get up and do something!     They tested her blood sugar.  210.  They're concerned about it.  It was 98 this morning fasting.     My father got back from getting something to eat.  I thought he was going to bring something back for her.  he didn't.  She went to the bathroom.  Got weighed.  Not much regained but 2 pounds in a couple of weeks.  at least not losing.     She cried at some point.  I asked her if she wanted to get back in bed.   I mean - she's tired.  Give her a break.  My father can be a nice guy or he can be a pain in the rear.  I mentioned to him that he had gone to Mass and gotten something to eat and I had not.  sigh...     So then he got annoyed that she didn't want to go eat.  Why does he care?  He already ate!     I went and got her food - on the way back I saw her day aide.  I asked her if she could come help my mom eat.  She said of course and did.  She mentioned to my father how he needed a break.  Ha it's true he does but I need a break from him.  My mom needs a break from him.     She said to him go get something to eat.  I said oh he's been to church and he's had something to eat.  I'm the one that hasn't eaten!     She was so happy to help and my mom was happy to have her fuss over her.       This is why I have to be there.  My father manages to stay under the radar and my mom needs help.  I'll keep getting people involved no matter how long it takes.     the aide told me she has told my father other mornings that she can feed my mom.  She told me my mom has been shakey at times.  this is exactly what I am figuring out.  I don't understand what my father thinks he's doing.  Yes I get the independent thing but he should want my mom to feel good first.  To not be upset.     So yes I do think they have been overlooked at times and now she's getting some help.  Not sure about dinner but I'll do the same if I need to.     it's just tiring because my father pulls this ''i'm the boss the big deal i'm in charge'' thing and it's so unnecessary and exhasting.     I can't rely on him to turn to the aides for help regularly - it happens from time to time but I'm going to make sure things change.  he is also wearing her out by pushing her.  She's tired for whatever reason and they're working on that.  (blood sugar),False,rose_ro,2011-12-21,2431.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486751,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mom has gone to the same internist for nearly 20 years and he has always respected her. She has never been a whiner or complained about pain unless it was extreme. The first time I heard her say something hurt was   five years ago and she had two tears in a rotator cuff. Two years ago she had a fracture in one of her vertebrae.      My mom has had excruciating pain since Christmas. She's skipped church bible study lunches with her girlfriends and broken dates with the boyfriend. She's had trouble sleeping too. I told him all of that. How much more could this interfere with her life and limit her activities?     It took her internist three months to send her to a specialist. He wouldn't prescribe any pain meds or even send her for x-rays.     The specialist sent her for a bone scan within 4 days and Monday (10 days later) we got the results. She has three broken ribs!!! The physiatrist prescribed Fentanyl patches - 1 or 2 every 72 hours. One isn't enough so I'll use two tomorrow. Hope it works. It's the lowest dose made.     I would change her doc in a heartbeat but I don't know any that are better. (I don't like my doc either.) I can't imagine what will happen if she has to go to a nursing home and have a doc who doesn't know her.     Sorry for ranting. And thanks for listening.

Neurologist stated he did not know what caused the change in his mentation.     Neurologist put him on steroids which did help his leg pain and weakness.  However right around that time his confusion and memory loss continued with the addition of hearing voices that he would be killed!  The paranoia also set in and he was verbally aggressive towards me.  I called his primary and was referred to a geriatric psychiatrist.  He spent 1.5 hrs with him.  He was put on a very low dose of Haldol and the voices have subsided.  The confusion continues.  He cannot remember than he ate just 30 mins later.  He puts things in different places so they won't get stolen....and then says they are stolen when he can't find them.     His primary MD stated he has dementia.  The psychiatrist did not give a diagnosis but asked me to buy a medical ID bracelet stating ""memory impaired"".     His second appt with the psych was basically to see how the medication is working...it is working well.  Next appt in 4 weeks.     Does anyone have anything similar going on?  I have read that Haldol is not for dementia.  Now I am confused!",False,Pat in NY,2011-12-21,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147487650,,,AlzConnected,,,

A person who sacrificed so much for family for friends and   strangers; who would literally give all she had to loved ones   strangers the needy or the sick without prejudice without limits.   She was the most generous of hosts with all who entered her life and   always with a smile and an unbending  faith devotion and love for   God. A faith that was tested many times  even at the expense of the   loss of a child. Her Faith never in doubt always guiding every   minute of her life.

Why my Mom? WhyGod?.        This week I figured it out; another lesson in life:  The caring of a victim of Alzheimer’s is a frustrating and chaotic one. With no ups only downs. A real test of one's inner strength and love; adversity at its worse. But loving caring and taking care of my Mom is not hard. With a lifetime full of sacrifice good deeds advice and love she has plenty of house credit in that account. As my five year- old son would say she wasalways a bucket filler not a bucket dipper!        After breaking her hip three weeks ago and caring 24/7 for her (my sister has been doing it for seven straight years) I realized that the true test on endurance is not onher nor on her care; she paved her way into heaven many moons ago! The real test is on me! I now know that is not enough to take care of her but also of everyone else around us. With a smile giving the best of me not only to her but everyone else.  While compassionately  taking care of her I found myself frustrated and angry only torealize that all that effort and love poured into my mom's care is worthless if it takes a toll on me as a person.  My Mom was the epitome of happiness achieved by giving not receiving.         My sister is a very unique and special caregiver of  an Alzheimer's victim. Throughout her sacrifice of daily caring for my Mom she works hard at not  letting  the darknessof  this hardship overshadow the miracle of allowing the very best inside of us to come out. To come out of adversity victoriously  resilience proves to be good enough to survive but it will prove worthless if it does not yield the very best out of us.

1556,6210d86d7b65de9a5b686167,2147487152,2012-04-04 12:49:00,Grief and Alzheimer's - Anguish Over Multiple Losses,"From Alzheimer's Daily News:            (Source: Huffington Post) - Marie Marley writes: When Ed my soul mate of 30 years developed Alzheimer's I sank deeper into despair each day. I thought a lot about grief related to loved ones with dementia. How you lose them little by little but they are still there. I was thinking about how many years the grief may last before they finally die and then another kind of grieving begins.      Death is typically a clear starting point for grief and it's clear that eventually there will be more or less an end to it. But with dementia loss comes in bits and pieces and drags on and on for many years before the loved one even dies. It is understandable why I felt overwhelmed by the prospect of so many years of grieving.  1. Grief Over the Loss of the ""Previous Person"" - When a loved one is showing clear signs of dementia that person begins to fade away resulting in feelings of loss and despair. And there are so many losses over time. These may include things such as negative personality changes not being able to have meaningful conversations and in many cases the person with dementia not even recognizing loved ones.   2. Anticipatory Grief - When one is expecting a person to die - It typically has the same symptoms as grief after any other death. To deal with this it can be helpful to try to shift your focus from the anticipated death of the person to trying to enjoy together the time that's remaining. It's important to try to think of all the ways you might be able to improve the person's quality of remaining life.  3. Grief When the Person Actually Dies - Grief when a loved one with dementia dies can be more difficult than that for other types of death. One reason is because the caregiver has usually already been grieving the loss of the person for years. It's difficult to endure the seemingly endless grief.  4. Complicated Grief - Complicated grief also referred to as unresolved grief is that which does not lessen with time or is so intense it significantly interferes with one's life. It may appear as major depression lead to substance abuse cause thoughts of suicide or take on the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It may also become chronic grief. Surprisingly complicated grief may also manifest itself as a complete absence of mourning. Complicated grief usually requires professional help from a physician and/or psychotherapist.  5. Moving On - Grief must be fully experienced before you can move on. You need to allow yourself time to grieve. It's important to take good care of yourself physically and emotionally during this time. It will also help to realize that with time your pain will lessen and you will be able to move on.

And I still can't get her to go daily.  She'll go 3 or 4 days but then 3 or 4 days she don't.  She's drinking more now than before and I still give her fruits jello popsicles etc.  She still eats really good even tho it's left handed and makes a mess.  One night she said ..you try eating left handed and see how fun it is.  I did..not fun! lol       She still wants to take her daily rides she can barely make it to the car. I let her walk there just so she gets some sort of exercise.  The ride goes fine but now when we come home she says ..who lives here?  Our name is on the mailbox and she  asks...what ""last name"" lives here?  Once in the house she's still confused for a while but then gets better.  The sundowning thing has moved from around 5 or 6 pm to anywhere from midnight on.  When we had 2 weeks of really warm weather I took mom outside with me set her in a chair in the shade and let her watch me weed flower beds etc.  She loved it!  started a list of what she thinks I need to do next.       I have a sitter come in 3 days a week now and will be increasing that even more.   I'm so tired and need a break more often than before.And with this great weather I want to be outside.  I'm considing having a sitter at night even if it's just a couple of nights so I can go to my bed and get some real sleep.  The local alz assc calls me every week now I've been talking to them for years.       ok people I think I""m done no more posts at least for now.    Great to be back!",False,cb55,2012-04-06,67.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147487222,,,AlzConnected,,,
1558,6210d8e67b65de9a5b6862ef,2147487341,2012-04-11 08:31:00,Update on MIL,"I  have not posted here in quite a while but I still read to see how everyone is doing.     I wanted to say hello and post a little update on MIL. She has been in the NH for a little over nine weeks now. She is doing as well as possible actually much better than we had anticipated for her medical condition. Her cardiac condition seems to be fairly stable at this time. I do not remember the unit that is used for measuring blood oxygen but the NH doctor told us that the normal level is around 90 and MIL's level is 16. She is supposed to be on oxygen for this but she pulls the tubes out and fights with the staff over it. When she went into the NH she had a significant tremor in her hands that was making it difficult for her to feed herself. I do not know what has changed but the tremor has completely disappeared. She has not had any more TIAs since December.     MIL's AD has progressed somewhat. When she went into the NH she was already having a great deal of trouble walking and could not manage unassisted. She can briefly stand with support now enough to transfer from chair to bed or toilet but can no longer walk and is in a wheel chair all of the time. She no longer recognizes any family members at all. She can still speak somewhat but it is nearly impossible to talk to her because she does not know who anyone is and cannot recall what was said to her seconds ago.      The staff at the NH makes every effort to socialize MIL to the best of her ability. She needs the assistance of an aide when eating her meals but they bring her to a large common room so that she can eat with other people and not alone in her room. They have movie nights and ice cream socials and MIL seems to enjoy being around other people for these events. She is not capable of participating in a lot of the other activities at the NH. The staff is very attentive to MIL. She is always very clean dressed in clean matching clothing clean Depends well fed. They make sure that she goes to the facility's beauty salon every week to have her hair and nails done. MIL seems to like the people who are taking care of her. The place is not fancy but the care is very good and that is what counts.     MIL used to be very religious but she no longer remembers anything about this. The priest at the NH told us that he tries to bring her communion every week but she gets upset and refuses it because she no longer understands.     MIL seems very calm most of the time even content. The first week or so she asked about going home but she no longer asks. I guess she has no recollection of home any more.     DH's three siblings are no longer speaking to us. I had posted about how much trouble they were giving us over the idea of placement especially the one SIL. That SIL has continued to be particularly vile. She tells anyone who will listen that DH put their mother into a ""filthy snake pit."" SIL is very nasty to the NH staff but that is how she seems to approach everyone. Fortunately a lot of other family members have visited MIL so they can see for themselves that the conditions she describes are simply not accurate. Any of the siblings could have volunteered to take care of MIL or they could have done the work to find a placement themselves but they chose not to do this and instead to vilify DH. We were upset at first but we have decided that we have to let it go. We cannot control how other people behave only our response to the behavior and we have too much going on in our own lives to worry about DH's nasty siblings. This is just one more sad example of how AD destroys families. At least we have other extended family members who appreciate the care we gave to MIL for many years and who now support us in the necessity of placing her.     As for us we are doing as well as can be expected. It is now a little over four months since we lost our dear son. DH DD and I are still in a lot of pain but we have each other to rely on. DD is 14 now and she is really an amazingly strong young lady. She misses her brother terribly but she is working hard in school and she is such a good girl. I thank God for her every day I don't know what I would do without her. We have all been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love for our son from our own home town community as well as from his friends and teachers at college. He was a very special person and a lot of people really loved him. That is very comforting to us.     I continue to pray for those of you who are still struggling along with this awful disease.

He has no idea where he is or what the heck is going on. I am so worried because 3 days of laying in bed has drasticly changed his physical abilities. 4 days ago he was walking just fine all over the place.

Also took her off Neurontin for pain because we've been worried about that causing mental problems. The day she was off both was her best. Then they put her on another seizure meddepakote she had been on for a short while in 2006 that helped stablize her mood during a psych episode.     Well she' horrible now.  She wasn't eating or drinking much when she came in but is now refusing everything meds food etc. She's in a horrible angry delusion that she is going to die- sometimes she's going to hell. She's mad at everyone including me. She is being treated for UTI but it doesn't seem to be helping.     They have her on fluids to keep hydrated and basically the only meds she's getting regularly come thru the iv- antiobiotic and depakote.      This unit isn't really set up to deal with extremed geri psych patients like my mom.  I told the dr I think she's worse on this med but he thinks we need to give it a few weeks!!!! HUH? She's worse... anyways to clarify the reason for this medication- she's on it because of an abnormal eeg in 2006..it wasn't a seizure where you have convulsions. But they are worried that when someone has this reading it's not good to take them off the seizure med. ( I need more clarification)     But what if the med is making her nuts???????   I think it's going to be a battle to try to get her off this. It's a mess.  Her regular neurologist is at another hospital and doesn't know I brought her here. Sigh..had wanted another opinion and thought impatient unit was safer way to go. YEAH RIGHT.      Another complaint- they didn't taper her off the meds-  just stopped. I thought you weren't supposed to do that. She may be going thru withdrawal too.     So what' next?  They want to finish antibiotics on Sunday and send her either back to nursing home or geri psych unit. I did get a geriatric consult and she ordered a morning injections of Abilify to see if that will snap her out of psychosis. She also takes Seroquel which only comes orally. the hope is she will then take Seroquel at night.      I also think she is in pain and that hasnt been resolved. She just gets tylenol but of course shes not taking that.      I also fear she may have dental disease and that might be affecting her wanting to eat.      This is a huge huge mess and I'm really burned out. I also live out of state so have veen living in hotels while here. No other family here though her pastor and friend visit her sometimes.      Do I send her back to nursing home for a few days to see how she does on Abilify and try to get ahold of her neurologist to get his input?      Do I send her right out to geri psych unit from cleve clinic?  I'm leanign to going back to old place that knows her that neurologist is affliated with( he can't go in but has talked to them in the past)     Do I just put her on hospice and call it a day?  I know they can treat psych issues and she'd be back in a familiar environment.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486723,,,AlzConnected,,,

They switched this aide last night Fridaybut said that's the only night they would do it..sigh..as they think when mom is feeling better she will like the aide again.  I will say that mom does go in and out of it with this aide but I think lately at best she may be just tolerating her. Mom's  mood was greatly improved by Friday so she may be stronger and more able to handle the aide next week but I still want to work on it. I don't want to leave anything to chance and I want to see if this aide can try to work on her approach with mom and not just leave it to mom's mood and hoping she will feel better.      My plan is to talk to the second shift clinical nurse on Monday when I believe the aide is back and request she give this aide some specific pointers on how to interact with my mom- acknowledging that I know this aide wants it to work.  I'm working it out in my mind but I'm thinking ""Use a Quiet Voice Move and Talk Slowly Abstain from Jokes"".   I want to keep it simple because it has to be communicated through a second party and I don't want it to be too confusing.       Do you have any other suggestions and do you think I should have the nurse give the aide more background? I think the  issue is that mom thinks this aide is too rough w her. Mom needs to move slow and sometimes has pain and a fear of falling so if an aide moves quickly and she has pain she gets confused and thinks the aide is the source of the pain and she'll say things like ""they beat me up"" which I know isn't true but it's her way of saying the aide isn't gentle enough I will also ask the nurse if she could keep an eye on things and step in if needed.      If this doesn't work then I will try to get some specifics of what happened and then see who to take it too next. It may be the Assistant Director of Nursing. I will be back out there again Tuesday so I will try to meet with her and see if we can try to work this thing out so mom can get along better w the aide. I really want to try this to show them that I'm committed to it working before requesting they not assign the aide to my mom. Hopefully this will show them I'm willing to try to work this out and thus if we keep trying and it continues to fail they might be more willing to not assign her. Hopefully it won't come to that.      Another question I have is do you think there is anything I could say to my mom too help her see the aide in a different light? I've avoided really talking to her  about this because I'm not sure how to approach it and I don't want to feed into this more for fear that it will just make this an even bigger issue. But I wonder if there is a way I could talk to mom about her? It may be hard to assess what that would be not knowing her of course but she still has some self awareness. For example a few times she has said she has felt bad about how snotty she had been to people earlier in the week that she didn't mean to do it but couldn't seem to help her frustration. And I heard her apologize to a few people!  I thought that was very encouraging. It seems like she is getting closer to her baseline before this latest medication/psych/UTI issue.      Any thoughts would be appreciated.      By the way I have yet another issue w mom that has cropped up in the last few days which I will be posting to the whole board.",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486924,,,AlzConnected,,,

She's recovered from that pretty well but that was the catalyst that got her out of her home and into the care facility.     She's never been really nice to me but she's always been nice to everyone outside her family. Now her filter is gone and her reasoner is broken so everyone gets to see her dark side. At the care facility they introduce her to new aides as ""the mean one"". I go over on Saturdays to lead a group game and I've found mom can get very mean and bossy during the game. She only wants to play for an hour or less and then she wants everyone to stop. Everyone else usually wants to continue to play which makes her mad. I tell her she can get up and stretch and come back to play if she'd like but she refuses to do that. I thought maybe she was in pain somewhere but she says no. I try giving her snacks and drinks during the game to distract her but that doesn't help either. She still wants to be the boss and stop everything cold when she says so.     She also picks on some of the residents and says mean things to them.

Yet every year approximately 10 million Americans are diagnosed with swallowing disorders also known as dysphagia. Nearly all dementia patients develop dysphagia and swallowing disorders are associated with stroke progressive neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's as well as respiratory and other medical conditions.      ""People who have difficulty swallowing food and liquids open themselves up to a range of health problems such as weight loss poor nutrition dehydration choking and aspiration pneumonia which happens when food or drink gets into the lungs"" said David Hutchings. ""These conditions can erode a person's quality of life and in some cases even threaten their life. It's crucial to help patients recover the ability to swallow.""  Symptoms of swallowing disorders include:   Reports of feeling that food is ""sticking in the throat or chest""  Coughing during or after eating and drinking   Gurgled speech   Weight loss   Pain in the chest or back   By proactively treating swallowing disorders and using specialized feeding techniques we can help to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and improve the overall quality of life for our home health and hospice patients"" Hutchings said.

She's worse after having been discharged 2 weeks ago from a new geri-psych hospital. The dx was ""forced normalization""  a syndrome that supposedly has to do with inverse relationship between seizure meds and psych meds. Treatment- NOTHING...just keep taking meds she was on for long time and avoid making too many changes.     She missed a few key Seroquel doses last week so i came out here and for the last 6 days we got all her meds in except one or two that I don't think are significant. She did get her Seroquel. She has been very very up and down and erratic. Sometimes her sweet funny self then the next minute crying or yelling at people or hitting aides.  Much time with eyes closed hands waving around.  Today was even worse. Lost in her hallucinations and refused most meds. (not sure about evening)  So much for staying the course!       Geriatrician wants her to be monitored to see if she is having seizures so we can rule that out. Then if they don't find seizures we can tackle medication reactions and psychosis.      Problem is - WHERE and should we do this?  I have lost faith in dr's and hospital and I'm not sure it can be figured out. I think she may have several issues all at once. I will not go back to the last place..( geri psych #2)      Or should we dial it back and try to cut a few meds first without the whole hospital thing? Suspect Neurontin for pain and Keppra for seizures.       Do I return to geri psych hospital #1 where they resolved two of out three issues but not the latest one last fall? ( She got worse under doctor's care and she didn't agree that mom was having medication reactions which she was.)  The plus is that they know her and  know to check EEG and her Neurologist is contacted to advise.       Do I ask Neurologist to have her admitted to his hospital for EEG monitoring?  He's helped mom when she was younger but botched things a few times this year and I had started to look for new neurologist until this latest problem happened. He said if i could bring mom to office we coudl talk about cutting back her Keppra or trying something else but made no mention of monitoring. That makes me nervous. He's also more of a general neurologist not seizure guy so at his hospital he consults w eliptologists. The advantage is that he s the one doct that's been treating her for over 20 years and does get her real drug senstiviities.  I'm just worried he might try to mess w her psych meds. Last time she went was admitted for monitoring she got worse because he changed her psych meds..      Take her to Cleveland Clinic main campus where they can bring in different specialists?  Mom's geriatrician doesn't go in but will talk to doctors there. We could also have them contact neurolgist for background.  Disadvantage they don't have the smaller feel of geri psych unit with lounge areas etc and no one there knows mom which terrifies me.      Yet anothe geri-psych unit that's affliated with Cleve Clinic?  Geriatrican would talk to docs there to ask them to check for seizures and psych stuff. This place seems to have a larger eeg unit. One doc there saw mom at geri psych #1 the first time. I never met him though.       Epilepsy montioring center at Cleve Clinic?        Or do I try to keep mom hanging on till she can make appt Wed with new geri psychiatrist?  This dr.also has neurology background and sees patients at Cleve Clinic. Not sure he would see her at hospital or not if she doesn't meet him first.  He's about the only thing I've felt hopeful about.       Or do we try to remove a medication that caused problems last fall first?.  Mom is down to 200 mg from 1200 of Neurontin for pain.  She was good for a few months on the 200 mg.  We had a bad spell last fall that sort of reminds me of this one. Mom doesn' have much options for pain managment because of her medication issues so I've been nervous to cut this back but her pain isn't completely unberable either- arthristis and anxiety related I think...mabye  a little fibromylagia.       Do I dare try to let the neurologist cut back the Keppra or switch it without monitoring?        Any other suggestions?   I'm leary about hospitals right now but if mom stays in the state she was in today tomorrow etc we will need to get more aggressive.",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486536,,,AlzConnected,,,
1579,6210dcba7b65de9a5b686f98,2147486330,2012-03-02 06:57:00,When is time to consider hospice?,Hi all     I'm trying to evaluate what to do about my mothers recent huge decline and whether I should think about hospice. (I posted a lengthy recent history of mom under the heading of recourse from recent geri psych stay.I wanted to start another thread though on the subject of hospice because it might have gotten lost in my other post.     My mother took a sudden downturn a few weeks ago when we lowered her Seroquel and increased her neurontin for pain.  The meds were then put back where they were about 2 weeks ago.  The problem is that even w those changes she is much much worse.  The problem began w severe anxiety- she was sent to geri psych hospital- they diagnosed forced normalization- unusual syndrome having to do with interaction between seizure and psyh meds and sent her  home saying- no treatment- just keep her on meds and make changes slowly.     She came home last Th. and for a few days was in and out of hallucinations- you could still see her personality and smile and make small talk..then she'd get lost in them.  On Monday she didn't get out of bed and hasn't been up as of yesterday. She refused her nighttime Seroquel Mon Tues and Wed.  By some miracle she took it last night- so it will be interesting to see how she is today.     She also has barely eaten for the past week. She still drinks on and off. Her voice has changed to a tiny mumble that I can barely hear. She doesn't look like herself. 3 weeks ago she was riding on the exercise bike at the gym! She was in pretty good shape. Nursing home checked bloodwork as of Wed I don't think they saw anything unusual.   They are tryign to get a urine sample to check for UTI.     A week ago Monday she had a full work up including uti check at hospital and nothign was wrong.      Mom is very fragile when it comes to medications. I fear her hallucinations etc could be caused by a medicaiton issue and/or taking Seroquel reguarly.        However I'm thinking about hospice because I feel like I'm hitting a wall with her medical care and that she may be very difficult to treat with her medication reactions psych issues and seizure issues. And she's not eating well  .     I'm back in town for the long haul and am going to try to sit with her during medication time to make sure she takes them but in the meantime I find myself wondering if I should be thinking of hospice.  Even if they find a UTI and treat she's had 4 psych/or med issues in the past 15 months and I don't feel like we have a handle on them. I've had two not so great experiences with geri psychiatrists recently and her neurologist is well meaning but not that versed with dementia or seizures. My best experience was with her geriatrician who discovered a med issue last fall. She's been out of the office all week though! Argh..     Or is a matter of taking a risk and trying to see if she has another medication issue and removing it before I think about hospice?  Or trying to get the Seroquel stablized first and get her to eat?  Should I try the above before thinking about hospice?  I'm just terrified to make a move.,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486330,,,AlzConnected,,,

1582,6210dda87b65de9a5b6872ba,2147486582,2012-03-11 21:15:00,Excellent Read long but conclusive,We all live our lives and at times when serious turning points occur. I just am passing through two curves in my life.     Of course most of you know my wife has been in Demented Alzheimer for 8 years 5 years at home living with me alone and 3 years in Care Facilities. Many things happen as Dementia (Alzheimer) moves on. (1) It progresses and or (2) the patient changes attitude and demeanor; seldom for the better. Throughout my 8 years I was declining in spirit and enthusiasm because I had a problem that I was losing while giving it my whole life and goal. I became almost comatose while putting up a front of accepting my wife’s illness as a responsibility but the responsibility was eroding my enthusiasm while I stuck to the responsibility of working the oars and handling the rudder and bailing water at the same time     As my wife’s Dementia progressed she became insistent during many of my visits that I take her home. Her prevalence often turned into a difficult shoving and elbowing ventures I could not avoid. I decided to depart quickly a visit if a shoving episode would start. Then in a few day(s) period two events happened that change my outlook on a unbeatable subject.     (1) I realized my wife really did not know I was her husband. Where most of the time she viewed me as a “good and loving guy” it was only a few days ago I realized she did not know we were married. And (2) I had a date to take my wife to a church singing show along with a group of patients from the Care Home. The Care Home phoned me the day before the Church singing presentation and advised they would not allow my wife to attend the group singing entertainment as my wife was refusing direction to calm herself to normal direction of the employee Caregivers. I have great faith in my wife’s Care Home so I knew they meant more than they were telling me. As it was I did not visit my wife on the “singing” date as I did not want to disturb the Care Home Caregiver’s attempt to calm my wife. This intended “miss” of a visit day gave me 3 days off from visiting my wife. The first 3-day miss time in 8 years.      When I put the total package together the inability to defeat a disease the pain it caused the insistence of my wife and the fact I suddenly realized my wife did not know she was married to me it allowed some clouds to part and allow new thinking into my life. I was in a battle I was destined to loose if I kept up my fierce sword swinging.     So I have been able to filter in via osmosis that I should offer to my wife her usual visits but accept what is there not what I hoped for. What I had been hoping for was some continued feel of my affection for my wife and her calmness to enjoy what little we now have together. However I now realize the disease of Dementia has done more damage than I was prepared to accept. But now I accept.       I feel more calm and confident with myself and my past and future contribution to my wife’s welfare. I suspect there is a certain point in battle where one accepts defeat but the pain seems to go away with acceptance.,False,Zolly,2011-12-15,2283.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486582,,,AlzConnected,,,

The apartment building has a bus that comes to take whoever wants to go to Wal -Mart and the grocery store. My Mom gets upset with me sometimes for no apparent reason and is so hard to redirect out of a really p_s_ed off mood. Often she thinks I am her sister and my daughter is me. She has told me for years that she will NEVER go into a nursing home and that she would rather kill herself than go into a nursing home. I have spoken to her about an assisted living and she gets SO mad she says that ""they are just a glorified nursing home"". She had to briefly be in a skilled nursing unit for rehab after a knee replacement and every time they took  her clothes to wash them she would call me and tell me that they had stolen her clothes..Mostly she needs assisted living to have the regular meals. She would rather sit and smoke than eat.  If she forgets to eat which happens sometimes even when we have brought her food she gets a pain in her abdomen. She has called the ambulance and gone to the ER for this and they never find anything and after picking her up at oh god thirty AM I fix her something to eat and miraculously the pain goes away.  I guess what I want to know is  HOW do you get a stubborn independent person to move out of their apartment ? Do you have to wait til ""an event""?  (such as a fall with fracture and hospitalization)? She is just so unreasonable even about going to LOOK or have a meal at an assisted living. Should I just face her wrath and try to move her against her will? I know she has good days and bad and sometimes she is so much her normal selfand other times she is a weird lady that I dont really know living in my Mother's body. So far she knows enough to keep her big calendar no longer cook on the stove and THANK God she is no longer driving (no car) and the home health nurses check on her and set up her pill planner which she uses correctly. I think I will soon have to do something even if it infuriates her.

Dad has had  dementia  for more than a couple years we believe anyway but things just have gotten so bad recently. When he was at home his problems mainly consisted of him not accepting any kind of change becoming easily agitated and problems with sleep.  He always refused to see a doctor and was suspicious and never wanted my mom to be out of his sight.  But truly in most other ways he was the same wonderful father anyone could ask for.  In November he fell basically because he could not stop ""fixing"" things and tried to hang a picture and fell down the stairs on a small stool while my mom was in the shower.  He was sent to a hospital and they told us he fractured his pelvis. He had no surgery at the hospital but each day was a nightmare of him demanding to go home and him accussing us of trying to put him away.  The stress of that hospital stay was horrible.  He was put on alot of morphine there. When he was sent to rehab we asked about the dementia and  they started him on nemenda and he was officially diagnosed with dementia. All in all he was surprisingly good there but asked to come home all the time.  He was still on pain meds there and given sleeping pills. We bought him home in December but his dementia just continued to worsen.  He was sundowning we were told and each evening was awful.  Screaming yelling and constant pacing and up and down movements.  Plus he would literally never sleep.  He would scream and get angry at us and at night when I am there he would wake us up and poke us if we fall asleep.  He also started saying he was kicking my mom out and wants a divorce.   We started working wi his doctor and trying trazodone and clozopan and even haldol but they made it worse and nothing helped his agitation or sleeping.  Last week he was holding his head and was pulling his pants off over and over and said he couldn't stop so we called an ambulance. He was put in the hospital with pneumonia and immediately we informed everyone of his dementia but the doctor there said no to giving him anything so by nightfall he ripped his intravenous out and started screaming and was sent to the Ace ward and was pumped full of ativan and haldol. When we saw him each day he was either a zombie or he screamed at us once telling us to get out.   He was released to a rehab center yesterday and is now on serequal but he has no idea where he is and why he is there.   He is refusing to sleep in his room there and they keep calling me when I am not there and saying he has eaten nothing.  I'm scared sick to my stomach all the time and confused.  My mom has totally reached her limit she is 85 and has only been to see him once and says he can never come home.  It is left up to me to see him everyday and figure out what to do.  The dr in the hospital said he has early dementia!  How can this be early dementia?  I'm trying not to resent my mom who has lost 20 pounds since he came home the first time but I am so overwhelmed and trying to make the best decisions.   I love him so much I just want to do whats right.",False,Kara,2012-03-09,4.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486590,,,AlzConnected,,,

1589,6210de847b65de9a5b6875a9,2147485925,2012-02-15 03:34:00,Finally told my sisters about Mom,"Geez couldn't post with Firefox so I had to get Chrome. Weird new forum    Mom has been in a NH since 2009. Dad and I have been reluctant to tell my siblings because of the fact growing up wasn't all that pleasant and grudges have been held for so long.       I took care of Mom because Dad couldn't stand to be around the house with her. When I almost had a breakdown and had to leave in 2009 he HAD to quit his job to take care of her and I think it finally dawned on him that Mom did have Alzheimer's. He put a lot of burden on me and for a LONG time and I have resented him for it. But due to my own health problems over the past year and my recent surgery I've realized that holding on to past resentments and being angry isn't going to help me with my healing. So I've let go of that.    I also decided to tell my two sisters about Mom this past January. Both of them thought I was ""mentally ill"" before I posted on facebook about Mom and what I was going through. To be honest I didn't expect a reply but one of them did. She told me that she didn't hold any grudges and that she was in the city I lived in for business and asked if we could get together. I said yes that I wanted to be friends with my sisters.     Well to make a long story short my sister has discovered that I am not such a ""sick"" person as she thought I was and even said it takes a special kind of person to do what I did all those years for Mom. That made me feel good. The sad part is that Mom has no clue as to whom her other daughter is-she kept saying I have another daughter? and she tells my Dad that someone named so and so keeps calling and she doesn't know why. I know that my sister loves my Mom and I know how much she wishes things could be different. She even wanted us to move to the state she lives in now so Mom could get to know her family-the grandkids and great grandkids. I had to explain to her how it works. You can't just put someone in a NH-they usually have waiting lists which are over ridden by hospital admits. Then I had to explain that to be a hospital admit it has to be 3 days in a hospital before Medicaid will even pay for the first 180 days. Then I said she had to be approved for Medicaid after that. Unless you've dealt with it you have no idea how complicated it is.    I haven't been over to see Mom in about a week-I've been afraid to drive in the car since my accident(and my lawyer told me to stay out of it as much as possible-the neurosurgeon said to try and avoid accidents(I think he was being funny at the time because I was joking around about the accident). I plan on going on Thursday-when I saw her the last time I really enjoyed the visit because she was having a good day and she was thrilled to see me. The nurses tell me I'm all she talks about which is funny because we were never close when I was growing up. It was over the later years that we became close and she told me things she has never told anyone else and I will never tell anyone else. She had a horrible childhood-a father who sexually abused her and now that the disease has progressed so much the inhibitions she had about talking about  them with just anyone are gone and now people are getting a glimpse as to what she went through as a child    I had to cut back on my visits over the past year because I was in such physical pain and when she was in a nasty mood it made it worse. I've had so many health problems since we placed her and believed I was being punished for doing it. Now I know I was just being silly.     I love my Mom and it hurts so much to see her like she is. I wish she was the old Mom but she never will be that way so you just have to enjoy all the moments you have at the present time.    As for the other sister I have been in contact with her. Not once did she ask me how Mom was doing-all she could talk about was how upset she was that Mom had destroyed all the pictures of us from our childhood. Mom did that-when she got mad she cut your pictures up. I have nothing from my childhood but it doesn't eat away at me. I had a really horrible 2010 that was non stop pain from 2 herniated discs as a result of a car accident. What I went through last year and the trouble I had finding any help put a lot of things into perspective. I finally found someone to help and had surgery in January. I don't want to spend my time rehashing all the bad things that Mom did-it causes me too much stress which is not good for my healing. I told her I didn't want to talk about Mom because of that reason and that was the last I heard from her. Which is funny because she wasn't too sure she wanted to talk to me because of her current health condition and the stress she was under.     I am glad that I reconnected with my other sister though. It was nice to spend time with her and to finally meet her husband and to email my niece.  At least they understand that I'm going through a healing process from major surgery and don't stress me out.",False,Sue in CO,2012-02-14,1.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147485925,,,AlzConnected,,,

I sometimes wonder if she ( my 63 yr old mom ) should even be taking these meds. Sorry I guess I just I'm just angry and frustrated. I feel so hopeless at times and I think to myself what is the point of giving her these meds and dragging this out?  Has anyone else had the same train of thought? I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way. I mean why should I try to prevent the inevitable? It would be different if she had cancer and had her mind and could have a good quality of life. With Alz it just seems everyone is feeling sad guilty lost and in pain. I have my good days and bad days with it. I try to stay positive and post to people on the boards here. I know I'm not alone in this Just the thoughts I get sometimes makes me feel like a bad person.     Oh I was looking on the medicaid and since my mom is not over 65 I can't get it for her it looks like this is frustrating. I would love to put her in a senior living facility but she only gets 2205$ a month in social security and veterans benefits and pays about 260$ in life insurance a month the other 1940 I have found is not enough for the nicer care facilities. ( many of the facilities start at 2500 a month or higher I am finding ) I don't have enough income to put in the 500$ difference for her I am scraping by as it is. I am trying to start a new work from home job and The past month and a half since she came to live with me I was barely able to work at my last job because I was distracted by her. My mother in law and husband work from home and I've had my mom wander into the downstairs area while my mother in law is working ( I put up a baby gate but she eventually moves it )     These things are small in comparison with what others are going through but I just feel so frustrated!

Although she was diagnosed about three years ago in hindsight she has had it for almost ten years now. She displays every frustrating nerve wracking overwhelming symptom described by many of you. I thought I would never be able to make it to the end of her decline.     Mom was recently diagnosed with lung cancer that has migrated to her bones. In three short weeks she has gone from a difficult paranoid pain in the neck to an invalid who is in so much pain she can't move a muscle without crying.      We were managing her pain somewhat until Monday evening when it became so bad I had to call an ambulance to transport her to the ER. Tuesday we began hospice care but have not been able to get ahead of the pain yet.  She has a pain patch liquid morphine pain pills pills for nausea pills for constipation blood pressure meds anti-psychotic meds cholesterol meds. I am giving her some sort of medication at least once an hour. She does well during the day but every evening she just crashes without warning. Her pain becomes very bad very quickly. Then I'm chasing the pain instead of getting in front of it.     Tonight she was vomiting would not let us touch her and could not sit up to take pills. I was able to put the liquid morphine under her tongue but it took five hours and numerous calls to Hospice to get the pain under control. Had to put a pull up on her because she can't move to get up to go to the bathroom; it hurts too much. She is so out of it she did not even complain about the pull up and that breaks my heart.     When I left her tonight she quietly said 'thank you for coming over today I love you'.     I have resented her and AD for messing up MY life and she tells me thank you after I could not do a thing to make her pain go away! She is a good christain woman and I don't know if I can watch her take this final step in her journey.      That's wrong I know I can but it is going to be so hard. I'm fine during the day; I can put the emotions aside. But at night (almost 1 a.m.) it seems too much to deal with.      I know this is not about AD but I don't know if there is a web site for cancer care givers; I don't have the energy to look for one anyway. Barb,False,baydey,2012-01-21,43.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147486186,,,AlzConnected,,,

Sometimes I wonder when reading stories such as these if  I/we can learn from them so we wouldn't put family in the same spot some day. . My father died heart attack when I was young but I clearly remember him talking one night about how taking care of his father disrupted his and my mother's life. My parents were good people who never turned family away. But he said to me and the other kids how he never wanted to disrupt any of our lives taking care of him.. He didn't live to an age to need that.   My mother did live to a ripe old age she held the same beliefs. When it became clear she and my step-father should be in an intermediate-care facility all she said was ""I trust you kids so move us there"". Years later when a 24hr care was needed again she said ""I trust you kids lets move me to a nursing home"".  . Now I don't say that needs to be template in every case often the parent/grandparent can be a very valuable member in a grown child's home. Even provide much needed services.  But would we accept the role of freeing family from guilt or obligation of caring for us when it would bring the stress to their lives.   Have we been clear to others that we would rather have alternative services than add a burden to their life. After all some of us are the experts on the pain.     .We and those who love us will likely all face such situations at some point stroke dementia  age.      I am retired and for me caring for my wife is hardly a burden at all but what about me when I klink out. I have trusted niece who already has a our POA.     I have been very clear with her I don't want her to lift a finger just be the executive in charge of spending resources hiring help or placing us in institutions.   I have tried to remove any recrimination from her mind so that what ever she does in our best interest it is exactly what I want her to do.   I just love her she is so sweet.  .

I have watched her struggle to hang on to her sense of self (can't explain it very well but you know what I mean). It breaks my heart.

Chemo and/or radiation will postpone the enevitable by a few months but we have decided to not treat the cancer and to just make her comfortable. I am floored by this diagnosis.

1596,6210dff67b65de9a5b687a5e,2147485348,2012-01-25 21:07:00,Please know the end,"I joined this online chat a few years back when I started taking care of my Mom who had Alzheimers.  I lost my Mom on January 11th and wanted to pass on some advice for those of you who may be strong enough to hear my words and perhaps avoid the mistakes I feel I made.  Some of this is harsh to read but I hope it helps others to prepare better than I did.     My Mom went into Hospice on a Monday and died in the early hours of Wednesday morning.  It took her 47 minutes to pass.  Her breathing was extremely labored she was on Ativan to calm her and Morphine to comfort her and help her breath.  When she was admitted the Administrator told us she was too healthy to be in Hospice but would keep her 24 hours for observation since she came from a hospital stay the night before. At 3:00pm she was eating laughing holding her childrens' hands and it she was better than her baseline just 48 hours prior to going to Hospice.  By 6:30 she was extremely agitated could not stop moving could not stop coughing and was wheezing to the point I thought she would choke to death.  By 11:50 pm the next night she started to die opened her eyes at one point to say her goodbyes as best she could and labored for 47 minutes until she took one long last exhale.     I met my mother where she was at when I started caring for her; taking solace in living in the moment with her and laughing at her still well-intact sense of humor.  This worked well for both of us...until the end.  What I realize now is that I am mourning two people; the mother I had prior to the disease that I never really let go of or mourned as I took care of the mother I had with the disease. Here is what I would like you to consider for ""yourselves"" as you care for someone with this horrible cruel unfair disease.         1 - Had I realized this then I would have taken the time to physically take care of the internal stress by getting massages and doing yoga and eating right from the very beginning.  2 - My mother was in pain prior to any of her family or the home health aide actually realizing it a week or two prior to her passing.  When I arrived at Hospice the wonderful Nurse taking care of my Mom (AND ME!!!) gave me a copy of ""The Journey Home.""  You can google it on the internet.  Please obtain a copy for yourself and read it.  Not only will you recognize signs earlier and perhaps save your loved one some pain you will be a bit more prepared for the end.  3 - If you can meet with a specialist or someone from a Hospice faciity to discuss the ending of one's life.  Even after reading the literature and speaking with the Nurse I believed my Mom would take a long breath and exhale in peace while she slept.  It could have happened this way but did not.  In hindsight and it has only been two weeks I probably would have decided to be there when my Mom passed but knowing she might have to fight for death a bit may have made it less horrible.  You can never tell how someone will go sometimes people leave the room to get a coffee and the loved one decides to leave.  Please educate yourself on this matter now.  4 - Plan the funeral ahead of time even if you don't put anything into place prior to the death.  My Mom was specific about her funeral wishes but it was the most difficult day of my life I thought my eyes would never recover from the tears that fell from them.  Please obtain a copy of a blank death certificate and fill in all of the details it asks for...if you are like me you will struggle to remember your own name and I am not kidding.  The certificate asks for the loved one's parents' names whether they are deceased or living the loved one's social security number their age etc.  You will also have to prepare the obituary announcement that typically includes the loved one's parents' names spouse name children grandchildren names.  You will have to pick out a verse for the back of the memory cards they hand out.  You will have to give the priest (if applicable) a summary of who your loved one was.  You will need to pick out Old Testament and New Testament verses for the church readings  You will have to pick out songs for the funeral mass.  5 - The deceased body.  Understand that when my Mom passed we had two options in dealing with her body.  We could wait for the Funeral Home to come (and they usually come within the hour) and watch them take your loved one away OR you will have to ID your loved one via a photo on a computer that the Funeral Home takes of your loved one once they are in their facility.  Either way you have to identify the body and let me tell you we did not wait with the body and my brother had to ID my Mom via photo ID.  It was HORRIBLE for him as the body starts to bloat and it is difficult to recognize your own loved one.  Not a memory you want to have.  If you can have someone in the family wait with the body.  6 - Make a photo collage now.  About two years prior to my Mom's passing a good friend of the family died and his family struggled physically and emotionally to create the photo collage boards for the wake/funeral home.  I knew when the time came I would not be able to do this for my mother and so I scanned every picture I had of my Mom to-date and created three separate collage photos utilizing Snapfish.com.  I cannot tell you how much this helped the day prior to and of the funeral.  I was not in any shape to do ANYTHING except get out of bed dress and attend the mass.  7 - Decide if you want flowers or donations to an organization.  In my mother's case we opted for donations to the Hospice group and Alzheimers.org.  8 - Get help with a social worker therapist or group of friends now so a system is in place when your loved one dies.  Get the people in your life who don't take care of your loved one involved in at least meeting your loved one seeing your loved one and understanding what you are going through each day.     I hope this information helps you.  If it helps just one person in their journed of letting go of a loved one in a dignified and prepared manner it has been worth posting.  You may find that your religious beliefs and/or state requirements might not require all of what I've described so I urge you to find out via Funeral Home directors Hospice Administrators and Social Workers what to expect in your area.     I bless your process and offer up a prayer that you have the stength and love to say your good-byes in the best way possible for you and your family.",False,CDiane,2012-01-25,3.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147485348,,,AlzConnected,,,

Not much surprises me anymore but this certainly did. We met with the doctor who explained the procedure and then a resident came in. She was going to be doing the ultrasound while the other doctor gave the injection. I couldn't stay in the room....    After about 5 minutes or so I saw the doctor come out and I thought the other doctor did too so I was worried mom was alone in the room. I waited a couple of minutes but the doctor didn't return so I was worried and went to check on mom. I knocked and entered the room. To my utter amazement the doctor who gave my mom the ultrasound was still in the room and had helped my mom get dressed. This included: depends and undies!      I was so surprised. Not very often will you see a doctor helping a patient get dressed.

There was no damage to speak of to my truck but his turn signal light was hanging off. He went up under my bumper.     My back is getting worse now the pain is constant in the lower and between my shoulder blades.

She is insisting it is only in one eye once a day and she puts up such a fight about the other one that they can't do it in both eyes.      the people at her ALF have had to call the doctor multiple times to get him on the phone to tell her she needs the eyedrops in both eyes. Of course she doesn't remember ten minutes later so for the second round of eye drops it's the same fight.  Of course if they only put it in one eye every day then her other eye starts hurting her horribly and then she complains but NO DONT OFFER TO PUT IN AN EYE DROP TO FIX THE PAIN!!!  GOD FORBID!!! she would rather live with her eye being in extraordinary pain simply because she is 100% sure that the doctor did not perscribe drops for that eye (never mind the bottle says both eyes - she says that is wrong).      the people who administer the medicine have been unable to get the drops in because she puts up such a fight. I would think they would be experts in this but grandma is a 3 1/2 ft tall hellspawn demon most days - I know how badly she can put up a fight. I'm just glad every day thay don't kick her out.      Grandma grew up really spoiled as the youngest child and had a husband who spoiled her so now I think part of it is about her not getting her own way and it's almost a temper tantrum.      So they're having the doctor call her AGAIN right before putting the drops in tomorrow so they can get both eyes but the simple fact remains that they can't get the doc on the phone every day.      This isn't like  oh she'll go blind she's practically blind anyway what does it matter - this is like the pressure in her eye will build up until it ruptures and then she'll have to have the eye removed!!! GAAHHH      I love my grandma but I hate her sometimes. My family has kicked around the idea of just letting the eye go bad because she's so difficult - but nobody wants that for her either - that will bring on a whole host of other problems of her not seeing. She HATES dogs so it's not like she can have a seeing eye dog (not sure if they would allow on ein the ALF but lets not even go there at the moment). ugghh I can see it now - she'll be blind in one eye and have lost another and freak out every day because ""something is wrong with my eye - I can't see out of it"" and then refusing to use a stick (whatever you call those things blind people use) to feel around because she's sure she can see just fine. She already can't walk and refuses to use her cane because she thinks she can walk just fine. I guess once her eyes go she can just hallucinate her way around the room?      I hate this disease. She can't get out of her own way.   She was like this before just being a stubborn donkey in her own way.

I would give a lot to have her character traits. She possesses the rare ability to love the most unloveable people.   She kept her emotional pain mostly inside and turned to God to sustain her. Her faith was rock solid. Her humility was and is still a very meaningful example of the person she is.  Not long after my father's death we learned she had this horrible disease.  Her only sibling (a sister) was already far into to her own battle with AD.  My mother has six children. I am the oldest. Like so many others I've read about here the family fell apart when she needed them most. Two of my sisters actually stealing from her. I never would have dreamed them capable of doing such a thing.   I lived 500 miles from my mother. All my sisters and brother lived within minutes of her. Things got so bad with tension between family members very high and my mother was being neglected. In 2007 we moved my mother in with my husband and me. The family conflict is on going. I don't know if I'll ever forgive two of my sisters who hurt our mama so much. She was a good kind mother. Teaching us right from wrong expecting us to respect others and that we were responsible for our actions. She did this by living as an example of these things in her gentle quietness even in the middle of terrible turmoil.  The nursing home here was horrible. We tried two homes which are thought by the general public here to be wonderful places. But they are not.  After four years of extreme stress trying to work with this home and the most awful things happening continuously to my mother we had to do something.  We have a small cottage 2 hours from our home where we tried to get away once in awhile. It is in a very small town. There was a nursing home there but I resisted visiting it because I felt defeated and that all the homes were the same. But when things got so bad at the home here I did visit the other home. They have a MCU and I was pleasantly surprised.   To make a long post shorter we moved my mother there in October. It isn't perfect but it is better. Now my husband and I live 3 1/2 days each week here at our home and my husband goes to work at his office.  We live the other 3 1/2 days in the other house where my husband works two days from there and I check on and spend lots of time with my mother.  Its a strain on us and tiring living in two places. I feel guilty leaving my mother those 3 1/2 days. I was very hands on with her care when she was here in the home because I had to be. I still need to be on top of things---never really being able to trust anyone. People have taught me that. So even in a better home I still feel the heavy burden of overseeing her care. It worries me to be away those days but I hate to not be with my husband and away from my home.  My question for you folks is concerning my faith. I can't go to church or read the Bible anymore. I can not connect a God of love with this horrible disease.  She loved Him and trusted Him completely. Why would it be His will to drag her death out like this. People have told me there is a purpose. I get very angry at that explanation. I don't believe there is any purpose in a person dying like this.   The worse is I am so powerless. I can not describe how it hurts to know she is unable to tell us what her needs are or what might be causing her pain.   Where is God? Please help me understand. She would not want me to lose my faith.   I think I could handle eveything better if I just knew the people caring for her are always compassionate and take time to look (really look) at her and see if she looks comfortable.The horrors she has suffered at the hands of her caregivers is dispicable. Why doesn't God protect her?  Why doesn't He gently end her suffering? She is in stage 7.She is almost 82. If she lives to be 85 she will have had this awful disease for 20 yrs. Her sister had it that long.  Please how do I honor her by not turning my back on God?

Still need ted hose? think they hurt calves..,Hi just curious what you all know about ted hose.      Mom was given them this summer after she had broken her hip and her feet were swelling.      Since then she has lost weight( in a good way) and is starting to walk more with an aide near by.  I believe she is walking up and back to 1 or 2 meals a day. I'm guessing about 100 ft each way.      I bring this up because she's having a lot of pain that I'm trying to help her with. Yesterday her massage therapist told me she said her calves were really really sore and to please go in deep to get the pain out. I think they are squeezing her legs.     I know they are to protect from clots and don't want to do anything that would harm her so wanted to talk to you all before I ask nursing home doctors.     I'm becoming a little more wary of their medical decisions for reasons I won't go into right now...so wanted to do a bit of research first before I approach them.      Thanks for any input!     Caroline,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147485673,,,AlzConnected,,,

She's a new dr that I sought out after my mom had a huge medication issue in the fall.     Now I'm feeling so nervous and am second guessing my decision. Geez it's such a roller coaster dealing with meds.     I asked her to cut it because she was only prescribed it to  help with audtiory hallucinations that we later discovered were one of several horrible side effects she had to a pain killer neurontin.     Once we cut the neurontin way back all the other bad side effects disappeared so I've been questioning the noon dose ever since. It appears to me that she gets drowsy and more confused after she takes it.      She does take 50 mg at night. Before this big mess started she was originally at 62.5mg at night but it got cut back a bit.     So of course now I'm worried  Maybe that noon dose has actually been keeping her from being agitated before bedtime? The whole thing has my stomache in knots. Mom has been mentally stable for over 2 months now and I'm afraid I've messed with it. On the otherhand I feel that if I didn't try I would never know if this med is a problem or not with confusion etc. Mom is also on seizure meds and Seroquel lowers the threshold..she's had 3 incidents of partial seizures or related abnormal activity this year that I worry were caused by the Seroquel. (she's only been on it for about a year) so while rationally i know it makes sense to try to reduce this my emotions are a bit frazzled at the moment. I think I've been thru too many weird things with her.      I know we can always add it right back in but I would love some support anyway.      Hope this all makes sense. She has a along and complicated med history.      thanks  Caroline,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147485600,,,AlzConnected,,,

My mom's in a nursing home in Ohio and has horrible pain. I understand that the aides and nurses are not allowed to put heat packs on her but I've been told I can which I have when I've been there.     My question is can I hire someone to do this for me?  One home health agency told me their aides can't.       I'd rather ask you all first then go right to the nursing home. I don't want them to tell me know when it's not really a regulation...if you know what I mean.     i have a massage therapist coming in to work on her and told me she'd be happy to do that but now I'm wondering if that techincally isn't allowed. But I don't understand why it would be if I could do it just so long as it wasn't an aide.       I know the concern is for burns and the therapist will be keeping the heat light and applying it on top of her clothes.      I'd be curious to know.      I also know heat might be an option w physical therapy too but right now i'm trying to figure out the best way to use mom's insurance allotment for physical therapy this year. There's another treatement called anondyne light therapy that can sometimes be covered by pt. so holding off till I have more details.

He has been complaining of his bottom hurting for 2 months he says it hurts so bad. The nursing staff all checked him and he has no external hemmroids. My mother wants him to be sent to a specialist to see if he has internal ones. I have talked to the Unit Nurse and my favorite CNA and they said that they have seen no blood and there is no constipation. He has also had an exray of the tailbone all clear nothing broken (he has fallen alot)    The unit nurse also said it might not necessarily be his bottom this disease and his brain may be telling him that when its really his back or something else??    They don't think he should be put through having a scope as he may have to be sedated for it and that can mean bad news for his mental state. He is already declining in his AD. My mother is determined as she cannot stand for him to be in any sort of pain. I do not want him sedated and at the same time I know he will be so difficult to administer this type of test  without it.

Almost 2 months ago she slid down her bed and cracked her toenail   After a visit to the emergency room she was kept from walking for some time. Now it seems that since she hasn't walked in a while she no longer wants to extend or put any weight on her right leg.      During the week that she returned from the emergency room she would move it normally and have no problems but it seems as of lately she no longer wants to move it. I've felt and massaged her leg and when I do she has no issues and doesn't react as if she's in any pain. It's only when you try to help her extend it but when she allows you to do so she quickly jumps to the other leg and complains about it being in pain all of a sudden        I'm really confused about what could be the problem here I know when she slid down the bed( which isn't high off the ground) that she didn't hurt her leg so I'm not sure why she is behaving like this all of a sudden.     Another thing is that when she get's into bed sometimes she insist on getting in on her own. And she will lift her right leg up really high put all of her weight on it and lift herself into bed! Without any complaints or signs that it bothers her....     I'm just unsure if there is really anything wrong with her or if this is another symptom of her alzheimers.

1609,6210e1ee7b65de9a5b6880de,2147484938,2012-01-12 19:46:00,Introduction/Need Support,"Hi. My name is Beth. I am 27 years old and live with my mother father and grandmother. I am the secondary caretaker to my grandmother who has Alzheimer's. Since my parents have all the legal stuff under their name I just spend time with her (or try to) and stay at home with her when my parents can't.     My Grandma has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's for a year or so. She has been degrading what feels to me rapidly. I'm told that she's still considered too capable and with it to live in a facility or she either has too much or too little money. My mother is the primary caretaker. She doesn't work so she's kind of stuck with the role of that. There really isn't anyone else but us because my grandfather passed away a year or so ago. My mom never fully got the chance to mourn as my grandmother just broke down horribly. She basically had a mental breakdown as they were together for pretty much their whole lives. It was really bad.      It's all very hard on our family but especially my mom and myself. We both suffer bipolar/depression and while I'm getting proper treatment etc my mom is getting help but I don't see it helping anything. She suffers with bipolar/depression as if she is not getting treatment though. Right now my mom and grandma are talking AGAIN about my grandma's place in the south where her and my grandfather lived first as snow birds and then full time about ten years or so ago. My parents stayed down there with her to set up a lot of shit and do whatever and the three of them came up here in the spring and permanetly moved my grandma up here. All she ever talks about is going back to her place and how the weather here is aweful (even on a bright sunny day with a temperature of 100 degrees and high humidity). She won't give it up about moving down there. To my knowledge they don't plan on taking her down there as they've been advised that it could make her worse.      It's really difficult to constantly be in the middle of their fights or explainations or whatever that leave everyone upset. She doesn't understand a lot and doesn't remember much. It's difficult to see my mom upset or crying and depressed all the time. I'm usually the one who has to sweep in essentially take care of her. I have crohn's disease as well and am in a flare in my rectum. My doctor's have concluded that the way things are in the house makes it unhealthy for me to be in for my mental and physical health. So unknown to pretty much everyone but my dad I got an appartment on campus (i am going back to finish getting my BA). Campus is only 20 minutes away. But in the meantime it's difficult for me. Lately my grandma will just stand around and watch us do things. If I ask her if she wants to watch a movie with me or play a game she always says ""No not tonight."" It breaks my heart that my only living grandparents doesn't want to spend time with me. My mother and I get so frustrated when she's just standing around or following us like a puppy. For me the hardest things are not seeing my grandmother disappear slowly but the pain she causes my mother and myself with constant arguments always telling us we're doing something wrong not wanting to spend time with me Not to mention the non stop circle of things with my grandma and in general. There's this cycle where my mom and grandma fight (or get frustrated) with each other then my mom let's out that frustration on my father and I and it happens pretty regularly.      As I said I'm moving out to stop this cycle but I worry what my mom is going to do without me. How she's going to take care of my grandmother without me. Who's going to give her breaks and stuff? I just feel so guilty about moving out. It's just that part of me knows that I'm doing this now for my grandma that ost likely I will end up taking care of my parents and not my brother and sister.",False,Tiger040,2011-12-28,2.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147484938,,,AlzConnected,,,

She is on hospice now. I guess that started a couple weeks ago. She has had it for 10 or so years(my mother says) but has been well hidden by my grandfather and grandmother as well. I dont know where to start. This is very hard for me. Im crying all the time. I dont know how to turn off the water works. She is like my mother. I was actually closer to her then my own mother. (im tearing up writing this) I have to kids and the oldest is 12 and is not taking this well. I guess she is stage 6 from what im reading. She is bedridden on diapers cant talk much cant hear much cant see much.  She is taking sips of water and pureed food a little. She is in pain anytime you move her. She is on .25 of morfine and started the atavan (sp). I failed to mention my grandfather had a stroke in jan 2011. Her major decline was after that. The last 2 weeks went from walking to this.. This is not living...She keeps saying she wants to go home..We just put them in a care home. They both are in the same room.  How long does this process take? I dont want her to suffer but I dont want her to leave me either. How do I help my child deal with this. My kids are very lucky to be able to have a known and loved a great grandparent. I was not that lucky. How do they get thru this? I fell like Im grieving and she is not gone yet...This is my first death I will have to deal with in my life.

It has been a whirlwind week.     Mom passed on Monday January 9th.      She had been having trouble eating so we were giving her puree but was still very alert. Saturday she ate really well but her speech was gone except for one word here and there.     Sunday afternoon she was in pain but still responding. We even got a little smile from her. I went into her room around 7 PM Sunday to check to see if she needed to be changed and to turn her on her side. She was not responding and was shaking. I called the hospice nurse who came within minutes. Mom was breathing okay all pulses good and bp good but nurse let me know mom would not make it past the weekend. So we made the decision to have her taken into the hospice unit. Mainly because I didn't want my 4 year old son to have a memory of her dying in his home.      With all the signs and years of experience the nursing staff was sure that it would be a couple of days but less than a week this was Sunday night. We left the hospice unit after midnight to get some rest. I had planned to go to work for just a couple of hours to make arrangements for some of my accounts to be tended to.     Well about 6 AM the hospice nurse called me to let me know that mom had taken a turn and we needed to get up there ASAP. I guess mom and God had had a talk and it was time for her to rest. By 830 mom peacefully passed.     Both my sister and I along with moms BFF of 65 years + were there with her as she took her final breath.      Saturday night I had a long talk with mom I let her know that I was going to be okay and that I had a great life a great hubby and a beautiful son that would be here for me. I let her know if she was tired of this crazy world that she could rest without worry. There was nothing to be scared of because as I had been along her side throughout this journey I would also be by her side as she went thru the final stage. My husband let her know too that he was going to take care of her baby daughter that he would be my strength and shelter. I prayed with mom read Psalm 23 and held her hand.      My sweet little boy Saturday afternoon was putting chapstick on mom and he told me he was making sure she looked pretty because God was going to kiss her on the forehead.      Thank you all for the support and knowledge you have provided to me. Moms funeral was this past Saturday Standing room only! She looked so beautiful and at peace.      I am missing her so but I know she was greeted by my daddy her soul mate and they are hand in hand looking down smiling at me.,False,MrsG,2011-12-15,47.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147485027,,,AlzConnected,,,

It happens more when she is in her nursing home room which is tiny.  The walls seem to move pictures seem to be sliding off the dresser her wheelchair arms seem to be rising. She also says it seems like the colors on the walls are changing. Sometimes she reports that her legs seem to be swelling even though they aren't.( I think that has more to do with pain and the words to describe it are scrambeled.)  She's coping with it pretty well and tries to stay out of her room and do lots of activities. She's fairly high functioning at this point. (Some of you may remember a few months ago she had some issues with Neurontin- made her flat out paranoid. She's been so good since it was cut way back.)     Her neurologist and geriatrician think it could be meds but they are not sure what it might be. She's on a ton of stuff- Seroquel Keppra Namenda.  They are trying removing one of her two blood pressure meds Norvasc to see if that helps. Her neurologist says he's seen people have trouble with calcium channel blockers which Norvasc is. Anyone ever hear of that? We cut Namenda in half to see if that helped but doesn't seem like anything is different.      I'm also taking her to her opthamologist next week and we are toying with doing an MRI.  Neurologist said it could be something affecting the occiptal lobe too.        We are proceeding very slowly and carefully.. As otherwise mom is doing so much better mentally than she has in a long time still a little  more pain than normal but she is able to walk with her walker again.        I'd appreciate any input if you have ever heard of anything like this.  She really isn't hallucinating exactly- she doesn't see things that aren't there just distortions...     Thanks!

She said that while she was in the back of the house getting Dad dressed she heard people talking in the den/kitchen area.  She said it didn't sound like my husband and me talking and there was no one there when she went to check.  She said this happens fairly often.  She also says she sees people walk by her in the house and sees people walking outside in the back yard.  She realizes afterwards that no one is there.     She is having hearing problems.  She went out to ring the doorbell to let us hear it because she thought it wasn't as loud as it used to be.  It is the same.  We told her we will try to find a louder chime for her.     Mom had asked for a phone in the sitting room (den) so earlier last week we took her a new cordless phone with five total handsets.  Rob plugged the phone in to the wall jack in her bedroom while she watched.  Then we showed her that we just plugged in the phone cradles into the power outlet on the wall for the four extra handsets.  She had a cordless phone before but it only had one handset.     She told us on Christmas that she found her housecoat laying down in the closet when she knew she had hung it up.  She said it really scared her that someone had been in the house until she remembered that my husband had been in the closet doing wiring for the phone.  Yikes.     I know she is under a lot of stress caring for my father.  The week before my father had fallen when she got up with him to go to the bathroom. She couldn't lift him so she called 911 and ""four big men"" came and got him up.  The next day she got bit by a spider and ended up going to the ER because the bite was so painful.  They gave her two shots and prescriptions for an antihistamine an antibiotic and a pain med. When I visited four days  later there were only 4 of the 10 pain pills remaining in the bottle but she insisited she had only taken two.  She couldn't remember which medicine was which either even though the label said ""for pain"" ""for infection"" etc on the label.     Does it sound like she is developing MCI/dementia?  Or do you think it is just stress induced impairment?       Thanks for any ideas.",False,SillyMe,2011-11-30,77.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147484487,,,AlzConnected,,,

Because of this board the incredible support the sound advice the information about the details of the dementia journey you cannot find in books only from people who talk about the details.....because of these the entire texture of my life has changed.   I cannot prevent many of the ups and downs my mom experiences but timely advice slips into the pattern of my day and I know how to broach a topic with the charge nurse I know what to ask my mom's doctor I know more about what I can do for my mom.      Because of this board my day is more like raw silk than like burlap.       But it's still a raw silk bag over my head....My whole life is wrapped up in my mom's struggle (on my way to see her at lunchtime I had to deal with getting tradesmen to make repairs at what used to be her home and to talk to her doctor about titrating her morphine)   I think this is my way of expressing the all-encompassing pain of ""forced to""    One day I will have to say Goodbye to my mom for a few decades and will trade the raw silk bag over my head for a raw silk scarf I will bear the scars and bittersweet blessings of this heartbreaking experience for the rest of my life and will look forward to hugging my mom again in eternity.",False,Waiting for a cure,2011-12-15,295.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147484881,,,AlzConnected,,,

I'm worried!!,Hi     How soon should we expect to see illusions etc go away after taking antibiotics for a UTI?   Mom started on Bactrim Monday night. She lives out of state in nursing home. Told me today she feels the illusions are getting worse she's having trouble sleeping and is dizzy.  It's hard for me to evaluate over the phone but she sounds clear at least. Her nurses haven't noticed anything unusual and they report that she is sleeping well at night.      Tonight it will have been 48 hours on the Bactrim. Before Mom was diagnosed w UTI we were thinking it was another medication and we reduced it slowly and added a tiny pain killer dose back in. Her muscle pain has gotten worse too. I was hoping that her problem was the UTI but I'm worried that she feels her symptoms are worse. She's seeing the bed moving walls moving different colors and mostly motion issues not seeing anything that isn't there and is pretty lucid otherwise but a little concerned by this stuff.      How long should it take before she sees improvement?  She's supposed to be on bactrim for 10 days.  I'm also worried the Bactrim may be making her worse. OY!     Would appreciate any comments here. I'm so concerned about her. The last time she had a UTI pain and illusions she ended up having a seizure like thing that turned into a huge mess with another medication.  So my back is really up right now!     Thanks  Caroline,False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147484913,,,AlzConnected,,,

LuAnn Nowak Etcher PhD reported that patients treated with blue-green light were perceived by their caregivers as having improved global functioning.  Caregivers said patients receiving the treatment seemed more awake and alert were more verbally competent and showed improved recognition recollection and motor coordination. They also reported that the participants seemed to recapture their personalities and were more engaged with their environment. Patients' moods also were described as improved.  ""Some of the rest-activity pattern disruptions that we see associated with Alzheimer's dementia may not necessarily be circadian based"" Etcher said.

1619,6210e47f7b65de9a5b68893e,2147484667,2012-01-04 12:37:00,Ho Ho Hum,Hope everyone had as nice a Christmas and New Year as possible. I enjoyed reading some of the posts of events of that day.  The candy one was so close to home. Husband decided to bestow a blessing on me and made a mess all over himnself and the bathroom. Why does it always always happen after the HHA has left?     Have not been on for awhile because to be honest just felt too disgusted and worn down to even want to think or type and fingers are sore.     I did manage to get a few light strung on our railings outside and a few docorations inside. I just had to put somethng up. But I didn't have the strength to brign the tree up from the basement even though it comes in 3 sections. So I put one of our ceramic trees on the TV and the bigger one on the sun porch where our big tree   always goes. Good enough.     I got punched in the stomach so to speak when I got our quarterly report on the Reit we have. My lawyer and even an arbitrator for Finra said to wait until end of year when they re-appraise their properties. I felt so uneasy about it but listened to the ones who should know. Well we just lost $100000. That is a lot of money. I'm thinking about suing the financial advisor who got us into this investment. All the lies he told us. But how do I prove it? It's his word against mine. Now with their 40% penalty to withdraw money they might as well keep everything. Now those that told me to wait are saying I get a quartely dividend. Yeah great. That would   not even come close to paying for a month at an inexpensive  ALF if the time ever comes for the husband. My husband had already been diagnosed as having Alz. before this advisor talked us into getting into this thing. And I didn't know anything because up until about 2 yrs. previous husband never discussed anything with me.      Then 5days before Christmas our 16 yr. old catPeaches who has arthritis very bad and also mega colon got bound up again. Had to take her to critical care vet for 2 days. She had to have an enema to get her cleaned out. She is on meds for that and 2 pain meds for the arthritis. Then Christmas eve had to take her back because she was not eating. They did manage to get her to eat a little. They said to try to get her to eat at least something. Cats can't go for long without food or it affects the liver. Then I had to go to ER. The receptionist saw my fingers and said one looked infected. They kept Peaches for me while I went. They have a prompt care and I was taken right away.     I had contact dermatitis and fingers were so sore and raw I didn't feel like doing much of anything. I still have it but not as bad. Still have not been able to figure out what is causing it.  I haven't changed anything I have been using. Great type changed and I can't get it to stay the way it was.         Didn't feel like fussing with a big meal on Christmas so I bought Cornish game hens. I made the stuffing on the stove. Got chicken broth and cooked the onions and celery i n the broth until done adding my seasoning.Then dumped the bag of  stuffing in and  let it sit few minutes. Since I hate to cook I was surprised at how good it turned out. Tasted almost like it came out of a turkey.Husband who has not been eating a lot lately surprised me and ate the whole hen plus stuffing and other vegetables. I was busy giving Peaches some of mine she loves chicken.    Guess that got her going and she is eating now.         Then New Year's evening husband decided to have one of his temper tantrums as I call them. Wanted his hat and coat so he could go home. The meds did not work and I could not get him redirected  to anything else. I was up almost the whole night. I called the 800 number and all I was told to do was call 911 and have him taken to hospital for evaluation. I tried to explain our hospital does not do that. Tried that couple years ago and was given presciptions for 2 meds. Before I got them filled called his neurologist and he said don't give them to him. He was rather upset at what hospita; prescibed. I tried staying up until aid came at 8 am but the cat was getting scared by husbands loud talking.I finally at 5:45 am took her in my bedroom and laid on bed. I fell asleep and aid woke me up that     husband had fallen and hand swollen up. When I got up there were couple Christmas decorations that husband had broken.       So off to the ER we go. Spent a good part of the day there. They were busy from all the New Year's day partiers. Husband had broken middle finger on left hand and badly spained thumb. He did this 2 yrs. ago on Dec. 30. I asked him if this was his way of celebrating New Year's. They put splint on finger and wrapped his thumb. I told them to wrap everything good because he will pull things off. They did a good job or so I thought. Got up next morning and everything on the floor. Tried putting splint back on but every time I tried he hollered. Hospital gave me name of orthopedic doctor to go to. Called up to make an appointment andn turns out he's a plastic surgeon. What next. Decided to call group I go to but can't get in until next week. Sent splint to daycare today and nurse there was able to put it on. But he will pull if off again.      At this time I am more worried about Peaches than husband. Don't take that the worng way. But it is so hard to decide what to do for her. Our other cat last year I knew. He had intestinal lymphoma and you knew when the time came. She is pretty good other than the arthritis being the biggestproblem. I don''t want her to suffer needlessly but don't know if it's that time yet. What is also sad is Peaches used to be more husband's little girl. Our other cat was Mommy's big boy. He was part Siamese and very vocal. Would follow me all over the house. I still miss him so much. Husband doesn't pay much attention to Peaches anymore. So I am making up for it.     For those that remember me complaing about the lady next door with her 9 labs they are still barking and barking. I did get one of those bark control devices even has a remote control device but it doesn't do any good. She knows it's there and lets the dogs out even more. I have nothing against dogs. In  fact always had them all through grammar and high schools and beyond but we never let them bark like she lets hers. Can't even open windows on that side of the house which happen to be our bedrooms in the summer because her yard is nothing but dirt ffrom dogs running around and it comes in our house. I kept wondering why bathtub and window sills always had dirt on them. Thought at first it was from the lawn maintainace people. But then I said they're not here every day. Boy she is one snippy person. If I even try to talk to her all she does is yell shut up at me. So I stopped trying to quite awhile ago. It's 2 or 3 dogs out then about 10 or 15 min. later another 2 or 3 and so on all day long. She knows my husband has Alz. and the barking annoys us so she does it all the more. Nice neighbor.     Everything seems to be changing. This website my mail account a website I'm on for pets and another one may be changing. What is going on? So many changes. I didn't notice but the type went back and I didn't do anything. I must be loosing my marbles.     Happy New Year.,False,Fluffy,2011-12-05,126.0,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147484667,,,AlzConnected,,,

1621,6210e4ff7b65de9a5b688ae4,2147484439,2011-12-27 06:56:00,Need to vent!,Thursday I called the doctors office that did the surgery on my back to request some more muscle relaxers and pain killers. The nurse I spoke to was very short with me and not very nice. She said she'd have a PA call me back. He called about 2pm and I explained what was going on and he said he'd have them call in the RX's. I made another 5-7 calls between them and the pharmacy that day and nothing came in. I called again on Friday about 4 times and no one bothered to call me back or call the pharmacy. I know someone was there because I would press '0' for the front desk and she kept transferring me to the general mail box.    I have been sick with bronchitis for about a month now. The coughing has pulled or even torn a muscle near the incision. My pain level when I called on Thursday was about an 8 borderline 9 and they totally dismissed me. I tried calling several times yesterday and the line was busy. Between the coughing and back pain my time with family this weekend was not enjoyable at all.     And having to do everything for MIL doesn't help my back either. It is much easier to dress her myself instead of helping her dress herself then she blindly starts shoving her arms into the shirt and that makes it harder to dress her.     OH!! And Thursday she started getting nasty as hell!! I took her to the bathroom after lunch and started toward her bedroom for her nap. I place my hand on her back just in case she starts to fall not pushing at all just placing my hand on her back to guide her and catch her if she stumbles or falls. SHE ELBOWED ME IN THE CHEST AND TOLD ME TO BACK THE FU** OFF AND STOP PUSHING HER!!! I got her to the bedroom and we walked in and she said she wasn't going to take a nap she not a fu**ing baby!! THEN as I was trying to lift her legs up to lay her down she KICKS me in the face!! I wasn't hurt I saw it coming and turned my head so she only got the side of my head. If I hadn't turned my head she may have broken my nose. So that further irritated my back pain level to 10 now. And I called the back doc again and still nothing.    I have 500 mg Tylenol here and have been taking two every two hours and the pain will not go away. It has gotten better back down to about 4-5. In order to get to sleep Thursday I had to take two doses of Nyquil a small glass of wine (more like 3-4 drinks) .5 mg Klonopin and Robaxin.     And then to top off everything else the security people for my credit card called and asked if I had been charging things online and I said no they listed about 6-7 things I had not done so they stopped the charges and canceled my card. Well two of the charges went through for $149. Wiped out my account. And of course they were closed yesterday so I have to go up there first thing this morning to file fraud papers or what ever they are called and hope they replace the $$ because we need groceries.     I called Vitas hospice yesterday because MIL has been nasty all weekend. Not wanting to take her pills verbally nasty and not wanting to do what you ask her to do. They never called me back. I think it was Friday she actually threw her pills across the room because she didn't want to take them. Took me forever to find them all before the dogs found them. One of my dogs will eat anything he sees. And of course she is only like this when it's just me and her here. Not when James is here. Not that he doesn't believe me when I tell him she does these things he just can't 'see' his mother doing these things.     Thanks for listening.

1627,647b5600025dedaf41a86b6a,65208,,Still Haven't Given Up,"For those who have been following my story...I truly apologize for running away. My last post was about me giving up. I couldn't help my mother anymore. This was the 3rd time and the governor gave his reprieve at the last second. I wanted to come back and tell you all but I felt like the boy who cried wolf. She's gone, she's not. She's gone, she's not. Then one week turned to two...then three...and emotionally, I was a wreck. I haven't given up. I couldn't do it then and I still can't do it now. The first time I gave up was just before Thanksgiving of last year and I said to myself that there is no way we're making it to Christmas. Definitely not to New Year's. And here we are in June. And believe it or not, it's gotten easier, I think. Dont know if it's the drugs, or just getting used to it all. Every ten days or so is a nightmare. But I can bare that. Listen to what just happened Sunday afternoon.I'm watching television and Im rocked by the sound of glass smashing. Within a second Im in the living room and my mom is on the ground with glass everywhere! We have these three glass-top tables that together make a coffee table in front of the couch and two of them are destroyed. Glass everywhere... Not the greatest view to come upon.The next 24 hours were surreal. I don't know what the hell is up with Kaiser. I'm sorry, but blunder after blunder. It's like, there's no one in charge? They don't share information or write things down. Im pretty sure it's like....2023? So we find out my mom broke 3 ribs after the first 5 hours pretty much unattended. Now, I'm fine with the amount of time because I know the second you head to the ER, it's an all-dayer. We checked in at 5 pm and found out about the ribs around 10ish. My 91-year-old mom moaning in pain. The doctor decides they want to keep her(us)overnight. We didn't get a room till just after 2 am. That's a long day. Doctor tells me he's going to give her something for the pain but because she's so old, it has to be a low dosage, ""Like 5mg."" Whatever, thank you. Then his nurses return with Morphine! Saying she won't like it at first but after 10 minutes, she'll feel better. I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow but my mom was beyond uncontrollable. From 2 to 6 am, 3 major episodes. I have never seen her like this. She had taken everything off of her and sat in bed naked. The little alarms beeping. When she gets out of bed, a major alarm pierces the ears. Im pretty much in tears as the crew gets her all re-done and finally I'm proud of my mom's providers. But in the chaos of it all, I get a glimpse of what her life would be like in a facility. The interaction, the communication, the insanity of it all. It wasn't a pretty picture. Sun comes up and I make a run for it. My sister to be there shortly. My sister steps in for 5 minutes... and turns everything upside down. Without talking to me or her primary physician, she decides(with the suggestion of some doctor there)to take my mom off of Pradaxa(a blood thinner). Her Primary and I have discussed this in great detail because my mom was coming off a Pulmonary Embolism and when the time came to ween her off of the blood thinner, I was against it because my mom did zero movement/exercise and I thought the clotting of blood would return and her doctor agreed if she really didn't move much. So, there's that. Then they come home and she mentions a pain pill prescribed for my 91-year-old mom...An opiate(Tramadol)!! Comes with the life-saving nasal spray which saves one from overdosing! And she doesn't even tell me. Thank god I read the paperwork that was just laying around.All day yesterday, my mom was nodding... like a heroin user. I thought I was overworked before...I have to do everything for ""broken ribs mom"". Can you imagine the pain she must be in? Just getting up, breathing...And stupid me was relieved it was only her ribs and not the infamous ""broken hip"" which in most cases, is a death sentence within 6 months. Then my sister tells me the broken hip and broken ribs for seniors are basically the same. Which Ive never heard. But don't deny it.So this has been an insane 2-day stretch that seems like a dream. On Memorial Day. I intended on a brief apology here and ended up on a nightmare rant. I hope the ribs and hip aren't the same. My dad broke his hip and passed 5 months afterward.

1628,647b560c025dedaf41a86bff,64545,,by Jo C. Hints Re Choosing Recliners and Lift Chairs,"It is a good idea to seek input and measure before buying a chair.  What we found out the hard way was that one needs to do a bit of research and measuring of our Loved One (LO); and so much also depends on what our LOs capabilities are.Since such chairs are pricey, it would be good to know whether you want to invest in a recliner only chair or if you think it would be wise to get a reclining chair that is also a lift chair as needs change.I am including a couple of links below, and it is a good idea, if you can, to get PT and/or OT input so you know how to measure you LO for chair fit needs and what to look for.One of the below links is with two Physical Therapists; it is a little slow, but there are many hints re chairs and rising from them as well as safety concerns.The other link discusses sizes and weight for chair fit.First, chair height makes a huge difference. When a friend's mother bought a chair some time ago, the place she bought her chair from actually measured for chair height, for width from side to side and also for distance from front of the chair to the back of the chair for her height and weight; it all makes a difference.We found that over sized plush armrests are counterproductive and a hindrance for use. Best to have a narrower more solid upholstered set of armrests that go all the way to the end of the chair seat. If the arms are to short, the person cannot use them to assist standing. We also found that if a recliner was without a lift capacity that we needed to take two things under consideration:Plushy, plushy overfilled chairs compact over time and comfort and capabilities change. If one has a very plushy headrest, that can sometimes be very uncomfortable for bad body mechanics as the head is often pushed forward and for some can cause neck/head pain.We found that with one chair, whenever one put the footrest up, the chair back automatically reclined. That was not a good dynamic as my LO often wanted feet up but also wanted to sit upright to be able to visit or watch TV.The other thing we found was that some footrests in non-lift chairs were easy to go up; but very difficult to try and get it back down again; this was was a huge problem as it was very difficult taking a lot of strength and our LO could not manage that. The danger in such a situation is that the person using the chair will not have the strength to put the footrest down and instead, try to move and stand themselves across the upright footrest leading to fall or other injuries.With electric recliner chairs or electric lift/recliner chairs, if a LO can operate the mechanism control; that is great, but sometimes we have to operate it for them if confusion is present. With a lift capability, some chairs do this nicely but other chairs seem to put a person in an uncomfortable feeling like they are going to fall situation. Fit and capability is again very important.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5qNdrKjM8 10 Tips for Recliner/Chair For Those Who Can't Stand Easily.Best of luck finding just the right chair,J.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/64545/by-jo-c-hints-re-choosing-recliners-and-lift-chairs,,,AlzConnected-v2,2023-04-12 19:47:16,484236,2419.0
1629,647b560e025dedaf41a86c19,64534,,By QBC - Medicare DNR forms,"The Medicare DNR forms also have a section on full, selective, or comfort care. The nurse told me to have their forms placed on the refrigerator - I think the AL puts them on the back of specific cabinets in the kitchen. Here are my comments and then a question: Their doctor discussed the DNR part with them, but not the second section. I think he may have copied the check marks from last year or made assumptions from comments they have made. I didn’t see what was marked until we left the doctors office, but I was in the room for the appointment, Mom wants DNR. Her second section is marked comfort care. I know she wants no major stuff done such as intubated or feeding tubes or cancer treatment if she had cancer. but I also know she would want infections treated with antibiotics etc. I understand her feelings and am in agreement. Dad told the doctor he wanted his heart restarted if it stopped ‘ if they could fix it’. His second section is marked full treatment including a trial period feeding tube. That’s not in line with what he’s told me, the nurse at the AL etc. His lungs aren’t strong enough for surgeries, he’s said he doesn’t see the need to go to his cancer doctor for monitoring of the thyroid cancer nodules in his lungs, and I know he doesn’t want a feeding tube or to be intubated. However he is the first one in line to go to urgent care due to shoulder pain, being fatigued, etc. Given the various terminal illnesses he has, I don’t think things would be ‘fixable’ if his heart did stop.

1630,647b560f025dedaf41a86c2d,64563,,Hypochondria,"Hello! My mother was diagnosed about two years ago. She has likely been struggling with it much longer but was very independent and hid it well... plus, well, the pandemic and isolation. Fast forward to today. She has had a ""sore throat and aches"" every day since February 2022. She wakes up and is ""very sick"" often refusing to go out with friends for fear of getting them sick etc. She was diagnosed with acid reflux caused by alcohol consumption (which she refuses to stop). It is soooo hard to know how to support her. It is true that she has had a cold here and there, but the consistent every single day complaint of how sick she is, just doesn't seem possible or reasonable.  I do push back and tell her it is her bursitis (arthritis of her hips) and give her pain meds, or remind her that she has acid reflux but that she is not sick or contagious. Also, if any of us mention feeling sick or get sick, she instantly has the same illness, it has gotten to the point that our family does not share if we are sick to her for fear it will set her back.  Doctors don't know what to do given that she has had the same symptoms and a million different treatments with no resolve AND they never check her chart to see that she has ALZ so they believe her when she says she just started getting the symptoms.  Some of this was venting, but my real question is... is this common? Do you see this with your loved ones? How do you support them when they get stuck in this cycle of being sick? I suspect she might be depressed or confused and that doesn't help us clear things up. Any insight would be greatly appreciated :)",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/64563/hypochondria,,,AlzConnected-v2,2023-04-13 17:57:52,824631,1.0
1631,647b5615025dedaf41a86c73,64535,,Looking for attorney who represents adult children with Alzheimer's parent,"Hi Everyone,My mother has Alzheimer's. I now live with my parents. We have difficult family issues. My father is in denial and focuses on himself. I understand his fear.The real problem is his four sisters. They have hated my mother since they started dating. Although my father came from poverty, my mother came from a violent family, alcoholic father, mother did nothing because of her hellish childhood. The world was hard 1910 through the depression. No social nets.My paternal grandmother warned my mom in the late 70s that her four daughters were cruel and she could no longer do anything to change them Her husband died at 54 of an aneurysm .y father's four younger sisters screamed at my mom, called her a whore, gold-digger, and more. She was not Catholic so she was going to hell. This all came from her husband. Said he was divorce her. She had three children, I'm the oldest. They ignored and insulted us since we were born.Two years ago, my father went into two months of delirium, ER, hospital, rehab. I found out that four months before this my four aunts held a secret meeting with my father. Told him to kick me out of house and divorce wife because she was going to use up all ""his"" money. So far, he has been mostly true to my mom, but he is influenced by them, and sadly can be just like them.When dad was in rehab they came early before mom and me. Poisoned his delirious mind that mom and I were going to steal all of his money. Once I discovered (dad's mind was still very incapacitated), I called rehab and said that none of the sisters or husbands were allowed. My mom agreed. It was her direction.The next day five came. An uncle who married an aunt late, is mentally ill like all of them, was sitting two feet from my dad's head smiling. He and wife carry concealed weapons. He laughed at me. ""So what are you going to do Belinda? Something is wrong with you. You're sick. Go ahead, call the police!"" This experience is outside of any I've had in my life. I screamed at him to leave. He said, ""No."" Finally, my mom, whose mind was healthier then, told him to ""leave now."" He slowly did, insulting me all the way out.An aunt was sitting at a common table in the main area. She told me for about 15 min what a sick, lazy, horrible person I was. I screamed and cried. Another aunt and her uncle came in - ALL AGAINST my mother's request but the rehab place had one person at the front desk, and she of course could not handle these people.This aunt got on her knees, prayed, and made the sign of the cross over her body. She walked around the table praying. I believe she had ""blessed"" water. It was frightening to me.Before all this when my father had been sick just a year before bleeding in his stomach. My youngest, most aggressive aunt insisted on driving my mom to the hospital which, as all her life, she stayed all day, seven hours, with him. My aunt spent each day driving around shopping as usual. She did this a year before. My mother developed serious lower back pain for four months. Thank God it went away. My mom is not a complainer. If she says something hurts, it hurts.The next hospitalization of my father, my mother asked my aunt to please pick her up by 7:00pm. It was too hard to stay later. She always arrived at eight and spent half an hour ignoring my mother and talking with the medical staff because she is arrogant and cruel. She thinks she’s the smartest person on the planet.My mom told me what happened. She never had in the past not wanting to cause conflict. My father and his sisters rage when challenged. I KNEW my mom was upset and afraid. She NEVER says anything. We soon learned that my aunt had pushed herself into the situation to gain control and make my parents dependent on her. My mom could have driven herself at the time, but she didn’t dare refuse my aunt.My mother has been walked on like a carpet her entire life, and taken care of everyone: her abusive father, her mother, her nephew torn away by her cruel older brother after 6 six years, and took care of her Vietnam Vet who is drug addicted. I gladly do now as she can longer.I called my youngest aunt and asked her to please pick up my mom and 7PM if not earlier. She screamed calling me ""bitch"" went on yelling what a horrible, loser person I was and hung up the phone.I could not put my mom with Alzheimer's at any emotional risk with these eight people, called the other three who a called me a ""bitch"" or ""*$%& bitch."" Also, my father was especially susceptible to their lies which put my mom in financial danger.My father has recovered. My mom's disease is progressing.For now, all eight are forbidden from the house.My father meets his sisters every Monday for a long three our brunch where I know they continue to try to brainwash him.My father was a good dad, is a good person, but suffers from mental illness, bigotry, and anger issues. My mom could stand up to him from her 30s, but she can no longer.My father could fall back into delirium. He has a serious heart surgery coming up. He's 80 and not in the best of help. I truly love my dad, but I MUST protect my mom.For myself, if my mother dies first, the four sisters will run over the house, call me a bitch and more and throw me out. I have two cats. I have not been working but part-time due to my mom and even my dad's illnesses and hospitalizations.I had to put on display such personal information, but I want it documented in case someone thing happens.We live in Wisconsin. I don't know if I need a lawyer in the state.My brother supports my mom and me in her care and need for protection from my dad’s four sisters.FINALLY, MY REQUEST - Does anyone use and/or know of a trustful attorney that represents children of a parent with Alzheimer's? I went to a support group last night and everyone agreed this was a good and necessary idea.

Not much of a plan except taking her to the E.R and running away. Or finding the closest Geriatric Psych Ward and doing the same. Leave all the information on a sheet of paper taped to her back. I'm sorry. Thats supposed to be a joke but I'm far from laughing. It's like I don't wanna think about what I'm doing...how? But I can't help her anymore.  My super unsupportive sister and niece have just called. When I had to undertake this horrible endeavor ALONE, all I asked was, when the time comes, please take over. I want to know nothing at that point. So, maybe they got something worked out. We'll see. I feel like sh--. I feel as if I failed her. God I hate this physical feeling. I can't see the screen on my computer because my eyes are filled with fluid now. And the throat! Why does it feel like its shrunk so much you can't swallow. Face burning as if steam is rising off my head. But these are all symptoms of keeping it in. Fighting the pain back. The alternative is scarier to me. If I let the pain get me, I don't know how far it'll take me. My eyes have dried up and I can see the screen again. It doesn't help that she keeps popping in my room every 2 minutes and some of the times, she's so cute and loving. But most of the time, she's manic and asking where is the girl? Last two nights have been horrible. Haven't slept. And half of the time, I haven't handled it so well. ""I don't know where these people are! We live here alone!"" Just making it worse. Is this the line in the sand? Because she keeps me up all night? Is that the point where I give up? Then I am a dick. And I am wrong for sending her away. I don't care about my physical or mental well-being. It's not about me! Right? Right. Then my other half says she's way beyond my help. How can that ever be true? We endure what we have to. Or I do. She's my mom. And I can't see the screen again. Only now the fluid is coming out of my nose too. Sorry, maybe I'm sharing too much. Nothing is going to be the same. Now we're both gonna be alone. I really can't think about this anymore or I'll jump off the *$%& roof! But is she even she? She looks like my mom but it's an illusion. She hasn't been in there for years. But I've seen bits and pieces...I'm gonna drive myself crazy! And it hurts and I can't imagine not being with her every day. The tears have been constant now.  There is a teeny tiny part of me that barely welcomes this. The part of me that was gonna walk into her bedroom one morning and find her lifeless. That part of me is having a parade somewhere!! Lucky bastard. I need to find this parade. A.SA.P.  But there's still a storm coming. I don't know what's going to happen and it saddens me that this might be the last time I post here. You people have helped me more than you will ever know. I feel sorry for all of us.

1634,647b561e025dedaf41a86cea,64391,,My story and ? about Gaurdenship,"I am so glad I found this site. My parents were together for 40 years, until April 22, 2022 @4:13 pm when my mother lost her 3 year fight with stage 4 lung & pancreatic cancer.  Two weeks before mom past away, my dad was in the hospital for 4 days with pneumonia. We initially thought he was having another stroke but soon found out he had dementia and pneumonia. Looking back there were signs of the dementia but with mom's fatal diagonsis we didn't see them. I helped take care of mom during her fight and was her primary caregiver when she came home on Hospice in Jan. 2022. Mom however had always been dad's caregiver, she handled everything. So naturally I had to step into that roll for dad. His mom also had Alzheimers, so he knows a little about the disease.  But there is so much we had no clue about and the doctors were not able to prepare us.  We have learned more from this group than we have from our research and talking to many doctors, etc. Dad thought it would only affect his memory. I noticed drastic behavioral changes but didn't know it was the Alzheimers. I talked to his therapist who tried explaining it was the Alzheimers but it still didn't make sense until I read everyone else's stories. So thank you so much for sharing your experiences.   My father has been a life long addict, 1st alcohol, then gambling and alcohol, then pills (pain and nerve). He finally quit drinking after he had been drunk for a month his sugar went up to 400 and something causing a stroke. By then though he had already had a 10 year pill addiction. About 4 months prior to his dementia diagonsis my sister and I finally got him to enroll in a Suboxone clinic. Right now I don't have POA or guardenship, but I do have control of his medicine (most days). He accuses me of stealing them, selling them, etc. He has even called the police on me. Of course nothing came of it but my siblings and I have put up cameras and started log books that dad has to sign showing he receives every dose of medicine. He constantly believes that we (his children) are all conspiring against him. He refuses to except his diagonsis. He has broke into my room inorder to steal his narcotic medicine (suboxone). Last week he swtiched pharmacies and then blocked me from having access. He had the prescription for 4 hours and had already taken 5 pills, he is only prescribed 2 a day. He claims he dropped them in the floor but doesn't remember if it was in my sisters bathroom or kitchen. Either way we never found them so we know he took them. He has called the department of aging and told them I was stealing his money and medicine and that I was abusing him. They sent in APS, of course they ruled it was all unfounded. He says some of the most horrible vial things to me. He tells me he wishes I had died instead of my mom. He says vulgar inappropriate things that I won't even repeat. He has always been a self centerd aggressively mean/violent person. But he as he got older it seemed to get better until mom past away and then it got way worse. I called APS in April of 2022 trying to get help and that was useless. The social worker that came said dad was in his right mind and we couldn't stop him from over taking his medicine if thats what he wanted to do. I have been fighting to get some kind of help for a year now. The only income we have is dad's SS check which is only $1002 a month. I had a part time job but my car broke down a month ago. So I don't have the money to hire a lawyer and to file for guardenship. An dad refuses to give POA to anyone because his mom gave him POA when she was diagnosised and he talked he into taking out a mortgage on her house for $20,000 he was supposed to pay it back but of course he didn't an she lost her house. He had a test done a few days ago that is supposed to tell us forsure whether its Alzheimers or VD and how far progressed it is. We are hoping that will help him except the diagnosis. During that appointment he told the doctor he it Spet. 1993.  He accuses me of stealing his money even though the rent is paid, utilities paid, he has cigerettes, etc. I keep all receipts and reconcile his acct monthly. I go over all the money stuff with him every month. Through all this I have been so angry and confused because I didn't know if it was the disease causing it or if it was just his natural horrible self, especially when it comes to the medicine stuff. He has been an addict for so long and abused pills so much.  If anyone knows of any legal assistance program that helps family get gaurdenship please let me know. I have spoke with KY legal aid and the one for elderly people but they don't help with gaurdenship.  There is an obvious gap between elderly peoples needs and the legal field.

1637,647b562e025dedaf41a86db7,64732,,New Here - Hypoxic Dementia,"Hello all.My mom has been dealing with some memory loss for about 9 years now. It accelerated in 2017/2018 when she developed a bad MSSA infection that went undiagnosed for 8 weeks. This was complicated by acute kidney failure from dehydration and pain meds. Her recovery was slow, and her memory never fully returned. Then in 2021, our household contracted Covid, and she developed a Covid PE, which hospitalized her for almost a week. At her follow-up after discharge, her PCP administered the short memory test and she scored 16. One month later, the PCP re-administered the test and she scored 23. I finally convinced my mom to see a neurologist in September, and they administered the short test again, with a score of 19. And we finally received an officially “label” or diagnosis: Hypoxic Dementia.The last 7 months have been a downward spiral. In November, she developed community-acquired pneumonia, and it was well into January before we saw a significant “turn.” We honestly did not expect her to survive the pneumonia, primarily because we just couldn’t keep her hydrated.I feel like it’s a ridiculous battle to get anyone (family or physicians) to acknowledge that mom is in decline. My husband and I are caring for her full-time, which is difficult, as he is legally blind, I work full-time (thank God for my remote position), and we have a two-year old. My siblings are concerned, but when we ask for help, we get a lot of “I would if I could, but…”Im struggling with so many things, and I don’t know how to put one foot in front of the other most days. My faith is so important to me, but we can’t even leave my mom to go to worship once a week right now. I always said I would do everything in my power to keep mom out of assisted living, and I never thought I’d even been considering it. But if my siblings can’t support us, I’m afraid my husband and I won’t be able to maintain this too much longer. We are both already burnt out. No questions… just… wanted to share my circumstances in a place where I am safe and others maybe understand.

1638,647b573b091b6ef899d1b2c3,64232,,Disheartened that memory care is recommended-help please,"I “put” my 91 year old mother in AL in November due to delusions/paranoia/hallucinations. She longed to go home and it was heartbreaking to hear nearly daily. She began to isolate more and not go to the dining room. The Nurse Practitioner changed some meds, and it seemed she became angrier, not violent or verbally abusive, but angry nonetheless. During this time, she complained of shortness of breath and was hospitalized with pneumonia. She was convinced she was going back to her house upon discharge. She was returned to her AL facility with oxygen (just a low amount) and was acting very weak. The facility was not prepared for this; it was not so much that she was on oxygen, but she could not do it herself. That was on a Friday evening. Sunday morning, she supposedly had a “ soft fall” and complained of hip pain. She was taken to the ER. Nothing was broken, but the ER doctor rehospitalized her. Nothing really out of the ordinary in her labs or scans. The hospital sent her to a short term rehab for some physical therapy and to wean her off oxygen. During this time, it has been a roller coaster, but she finally seems to accept she cannot return to her house and is looking forward to getting back to her AL facility. She does remember the nice residents there and staff, and doesn’t seem to remember why she complained so much about it. She had started to resist doing her physical therapy at the rehab center although she has latched on to a particularly kind nurse. Today I was told (not officially) but through a staff member that memory care is going to be recommended which means a different facility. My mother is not a wanderer, and her attitude has mellowed toward her facility. I do realize this could change in a heartbeat, but I was so encouraged about her realizing “home alone “ was out of the question. Now it appears I will have to break her heart and go through this nightmare all over again. Her current AL may not take her back even though physically she is getting around without a walker.

This event sent me into profound sadness I also wasn’t expecting.  Hate losing pets but ugh, she wasn’t really mine.  I hate being a baby.  I’ve been crying easily for a couple of days.  I guess I attribute it to the fact that both cats were an integral part of my moms move up to CO.  She agreed to come in her dementia way because I said we can bring two, not three, cats with us. All the prep on getting this particular feral scaredy cat on the plane with us, amongst other things, was daunting for me.

I'm happy to be here though  To start, my dad is a 79 year old Vietnam Veteran. He has quite the medical history, from type 2 diabetes to hypertension and heart disease. Everything he has is very clinically apparent... but I have suspected some form of dementia for a long time. It wasn't until a recent fall and trip the ER revealed an ""old stroke in the thalamus region of the brain"" and some other vascular issues. Since then, I've been stuck on the thought of vascular dementia. We finally have an appointment to get him formally evaluated. Up until my mom's passing on April 24 2022, she was the caregiver for my father. For as long as I can remember she did all the talking for him and controlled everything. After she passed, my husband and I moved in with my father ASAP and I became his caregiver. For the first few months, I was able to work a full-time office job M-F. I have now dropped to part-time work from home, and will soon be quitting my job to become a full-time caregiver. My dad won't eat unless I make him food and bring it to him. He won't drink unless it's placed in front of him. He has no concept of time. He won't get up to go to bed unless I am present and tell him it's time for bed. He doesn't know if/when he's in discomfort or pain. He can't articulate how he's feeling at any given time, and instead says ""I don't know"". When he's tired, he slurs his words and can't complete a thought. Around 4PM on any given day, he starts to sundown and decline cognitively. For many years now, and prior to his recent diagnosis of bladder retention resulting in a catheter, he would urinate on himself and sit in it for hours. I would have to ask him to change and clean himself up. Recently, I came home after running errands to find that he had a #2 accident and was just sitting in it until I got home to clean him up. There are days where I feel that I gaslight myself, and I'm wondering if others feel the same. Some days I feel like I am over-reacting. I don't know what ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" is for this disease. Heck, I feel like I'm over-reacting simply because he doesn't have a formal diagnosis and I've been telling myself that he has dementia all of this time. But there's no way his current everyday behavior is cognitively normal. Do any other caregivers feel the same? Do you doubt yourself?

I am prepared mentally, but emotionally I am unprepared and hurting. First of all, mom is using more single words and less sentences. Sometimes, when I talk to mom she just looks at me and I wonder if she understandings what I am saying.  I use more gestures with my hands  to communicate now.  I never took notice of the change  because mom was always busy sorting her magazines and looking at the pictures. I thought she was lost in her magazines for her lack of words.  Sadly, even without her magazines there are fewer sentences and more single words. Secondly, I found out mom has spinal stenosis. Mom has pain in her lower back and it is difficult for her to walk. Mom takes medicine to control the pain however she does walk. She can stand up using the walker, but sits right back down.  Mom never used a walker before  so it’s hard to navigate walking with walker.  Without the dementia mom would try walking (I think) but dementia makes the simple things complicated and difficult.  I miss hearing her walk around the house and calling my name to look at the tv shows. I can handle mom not walking a little better, but the not talking is harder. Mom loved to talk. We could talk for hours, changing topics and making each other laugh. Dad loved to hear mom talk too. He we say things just to get her going in a conversation.   The only footsteps I hear are my own and the silence is not filled with Mom’s voice.  Right now I am grieving and hurting.

It happened yesterday AGAIN. I turned off my phone today, hopefully I can complete a post that makes some kind of sense.  I am starting to realize just how much my mother's death from Alzheimer's disease has changed me as a person. I don't think I will ever be the same. I am bitter and mad, mad as hell. I think the disease changes all of us. It starts by taking over our loved ones and then it starts in on us. My relationship with my brother and especially my sister, will never be the same. They are the last two people I want to talk to. They abandoned our mother when she needed them most. My mother did not deserve that. They just couldn't do it, their words. Now they have abandoned our father, which I can understand. But I am hurt and mad because their actions have left me alone. They have abandoned me in the process. They do tell me they really appreciate everything I did for mom and everything I do for dad. I feel ill when they say that to me.  Our family dynamics were screwed up. Dad was a workaholic, his career came first, always. Especially when it came to his three children. I believe he loved us but I know full well he did not like us. There was no sense of belonging, we did not feel valued to him in anyway. He did nothing to help us have self esteem. We all knew he did not like us. He went out of his way to point out our short comings, he also did this with his grandkids. How can anyone possibly be a prick to their grandkids? Because of the way we were treated, I can understand why my brother and sister and some of the grandkids want absolutely nothing to do with him. I wish I had the courage to walk away sometimes. But I feel like he's now just an elderly man trying to find his way. He is lost in grief over the death of his wife of 63 years. Speaking honestly, I do NOT want to spend the rest of my life dealing with him because he's so difficult. He is 86 and in great health physically. He's much healthier than I am. My mother was much easier to care for than he will be. I am depressed. I feel like my life is over. I used to be a good person. Not so much these days. It's as if I've lost the joy I used to have. I wish my mother was alive and well. I miss her warmth and humor. She was so much fun, it was so nice to spend time with her. Not only did she love her kids and grandkids, she liked us! She liked being with us, all together or one on one. We were all special to her. Our friends loved her too.  I find my self questioning life itself, like what's the point? I am confused or maybe lost is a better word, I am lost in my faith. That is NOT me at all. I think about what momma went through and it rips my heart out. I think about what dad went through because of the disease. I can relate to his pain on that level because I lost my spouse to cancer. I know how it feels to lose your friend, partner, lover, your other half. I'm sorry this is so long and full of self pity. Geese! I've turned into the person I don't like! I think of you all and miss you. You all mean so much to me and have helped me time after time. Thank you for that!

She is in end stage Alz- bedridden, awake maybe 3-4 hours a day in total and does not interact. Occasionally she will notice us but other times she is just staring at the TV or wall saying random words or grinding her teeth. We have been on hospice now for a year and I have discussed with many of nurses about maybe discontinuing her thyroid medication. It is the only medication she is on besides meds that hospice covers for anxiety/behavior issues. The nurses have all supported this decision and did not think it would do much to my mom, maybe just weaken her slowly over time. In their opinion she has a terminal illness and the thyroid medication is just keeping her going in a state that isn't really living. I am in agreement with this, but like all of you, I want to keep my mom as comfortable as possible. When I google hypothyroidism I am nervous of the extreme cases where swelling or skin break down may occur. I just don't want her to feel pain, but I also don't want her to just be in bed grinding her teeth for 10 more years.

1656,647b57d7091b6ef899d1ba64,63069,,insisting to go home nightly,"I have cared for my 86 year old mother with Alzheimers in my home since her initial diagnosis with vascular dementia approximately 5 years ago.  In the last 3 months my sister has moved cross country to live with mom and I in my home to assist with her day time care so I can return to my work in person during the day now that COVID-related working from home is no longer permitted. About 2 weeks ago mom starting having difficulty sleeping and increased agitation because she never felt rested and her hip/low back was painful. She had broken her hip last year and she now has arthritis/osteoarthritis in her lower back and hip which causes her pain.  She is usually not an aggressive person.  Until recently, she did ok during the day time recognizing she was with family, in our home, and was interactive during the day but as she sundowned as the evening progressed she would be less interactive but would go to bed without much argument.   The aggressiveness and insisting on leaving started about the tie the mirtazipine was started by her primary care doctor to help her improve her sleep. It would take 2-3 hours to begin making her tired and during those 2-3 hours she was extremely agitated, aggressve and insistent of going home (i.e., wanting her car keys, jacket, shoes, etc. and tryign to push past us to go outside at night even when we tried to calm her and assure her she was safe her and she was meant to be here and everyone she cared about knew she was here.) During this time she was insistent my dad (whom passed away 11 years ago) and/or her parents ( whom passed in 1985/1986, respectively) were waiting up for her and worried about where she was at so she had to get home. She would get so intensely angry at any suggestion of staying here.  I don't think she realized we were her adult  children. She would push,  shove, make threats against us and herself all in hopes of leaving.  Each night as the mirtazapine finally kicked in she would eventually end up sitting down, closing her eyes and falling asleep on the couch. After about a 30 minute nap, we could rouse her long enough to help her into bed.   Next night, same thing all over again.  None of this had ever happened before so we called her doctor about her difficulty sleeping comfortably.  The doctor  advised us to stop the mirtazipine and  she switched her to a nighttime prescription of trazadone.  Last night was our first night with the new prescription.  The wanting to leave behavior started again last night. We tried talking with er for awhile to calm her and eventually got her t take her night time meds a little early (8pm'ish) and within 20 minutes she was asleep on the couch so it didn't progress to the extremely agitated/aggressive/threatening level.  She slept through the  night without getting up, so I believe her quality of sleep was improved. I am hoping the sleep will help her to be less agitated and less aggressive after dinner.  I hope this ""i have to go home"" phase will subside.   I am wondering how others comfort their LOs in the mid/lated stages when they insist on ""going home"" or that deceased loved ones are waiting on them.  She has even gone so far as saying she ""spoke to them this morning and they are expecting her home.""  She is not showing signs of UTI or constipation. In fact she is quite regular in her BMs.   She is diabetic but we monitor her glucose throughout the day so it is well managed. Her osteoarthritis pain is still giving her trouble, but I am using tylenol and topical lidocaine to help her and a heatling pad when I can get her t sit down with it. In her earlier stages I could remind her my dad and grandparents had passed,  but these days I just assure her that they all know she is here with us and that she is safe staying here with us in Utah (she forgets and thinks they are is back in WV where I grew up and she can walk or drive to them in 5-10 minutes).

He has tried using an adult pacifier for her but she will not keep it in her mouth. Has anyone else had experiences with loved ones grinding their teeth like this? Any ideas why she may be having increased grinding only during daytime hours (anxiety, sensory input?)? Has anyone had any luck helping to calm the grinding?

This might be a little long.. My friend has been a live in caregiver of her grandma who has Dementia for about 5 years. A little over a week ago the grandma suffered a small stroke. She was sent to a rehabilitation center but it was quickly determined that she was uncooperative and her dementia had worsened quickly. So the rehabilitation center said she couldn't stay, which is where the chaos started.  The only family the grandma has is my friend, and two sons.. my friends uncles. One uncle wants nothing to do with any of it. But the other has power of attorney. He only came to see the grandma twice while in the hospital and rehabilitation.  The grandma has been screaming for help for hours straight and is completely unable to get up on her own while in the rehabilitation center. My friend tried to explain to the POA uncle that she could not care for her like this that she was physically unable to. He would not listen. On Thursday he gave the order for her to be returned home on Friday.  He informed my friend that if she did not take care of her that she would be kicked out of the grandma's house, along with her husband and 3yr old non verbal highly autistic kid. My friend has scrounged to get things ready in such a short amount of time. A hospital bed and bedside commode can't be delivered until Monday.  At home health care person won't start until Monday.  Friday grandma arrived home and according to my friend.. the grandma has not slept in 24hrs. Screams for help, begging to die every few minutes. At about 1am she started screaming so much they called 911, the doctor said she has scholiosis, gave her some pain medicine and had them take her home. She's still yelling.It's Saturday now and my friend is mentally exhausted. Her husband is trying to help. But one needs to be with the child at all times also. Neither has gotten any sleep. My friend is so stressed that she gets sick when she eats just after one night.   They need help. The POA uncle isn't answering his phone. And my friend is trying but is also terrified that they will get kicked out if they don't do what the uncle wants. I live to far away to be of any help.

1660,647b581d091b6ef899d1bde1,63732,,end-stage sign of pain & discomfort?,"Hi all, My mom is bed-bound with end-stage Parkinson's and late-stage Alzheimer's. She recently became bed-bound; having previously been bed & chair bound (on days where she was more alert, she would transfer into a Broda wheelchair via the Hoyer lift.) She no longer bears her own weight / walks / or transfers with assist. My understanding has been that the bed-to-chair routine is good for her because it allows her body to shift positions and that helps her to be more comfortable, keeps her muscles more in motion and less painful. The transfers are also stressful for her and scary. I'm noticing a behavior now that she's fully bed-bound that I don't know how to interpret. I'm looking for help to understand what may be going on. It does seem to be pain, but I'm wondering if it's also a type of contracture, and if resuming the bed-to-chair transfers is a good thing to try. When we change the position of the head of the bed; from upright to flat (either for sleep or for changes and baths), mom seems very uncomfortable. The shifting of bed position must be done slowly and in stages. When she goes flat, she starts to do what look like abdominal crunches; lifting her head / neck and knees in a reflex-like way. Some of the time she definitely grimaces and moans. No doubt that is pain and we treat it. Other times, she doesn't moan or grimace but she looks very uncomfortable and her body crunches into a v-shape. She does seem to get relief by being positioned more upright. She is able to relax and lay flat with a gentle hand and soft voice and encouragement, but it seems so hard for her. As far as caring for her at this stage, we do reposition -- roll to her left side, roll to her right side, and centered. When we reposition, we pre-treat with pain meds and muscle relaxants as advised by hospice. The repositioning is getting more difficult. She favors her left side, meaning she seems to tilt in that direction. She's amazingly able to hold onto the bed railings and roll from side to side when being changed. But the stiffness and slowness is increasing. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is mom performing a kind of voluntary stretching and movement to counteract the pain of immobility from being bed-bound? Or could this be an involuntary movement, reflex or contracture of some kind? Maybe this is what happens at this stage and there's no real way to manually assist or remove the discomfort other than pain meds. But maybe there are range-of-motion things I can do, or massage, to help her? Thank you for reading and in advance for any advice / perspective.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/63732/end-stage-sign-of-pain-discomfort,,,AlzConnected-v2,2023-01-21 01:13:30,696084,132.0

1663,647b5864091b6ef899d1c163,63929,,Inpatient doctors prescribe antipsychotics against our wishes as POAs,"We know from my father-in-law Logan's behavior when there's some health issue that needs addresses. He's had Sundowner symptoms now for the last 2-3 years. We have a home care aid Maddie that comes to his house twice a day to fix meals, do housework, grocery shopping, and provide company for Logan. Maddie was his wife's caregiver also for the past 4 years, but his wife passed  in Oct 2021. Between Maddie and us, we know when it's more than a little Sundowner behavior.  We have cameras in the house, and can see him up a lot in the middle of the night, and after a few nights of not sleeping well, he gets increasingly agitated and combative, until he's arguing and fighting with us about everything, storming around the house, yelling, throwing things around, threatening to call his lawyer, wanting to throw us out of the house. A lot of times it's a uti infection. 2 years ago, it was bladder cancer, which was treated and is undetectable. Then this past year, he started having terrible gout attacks in his left hand sending pain up his arm, so bad he would call us in a panic it hurt so bad. The 1st time, we thought it was heart attack symptoms he was complaining so much. They ended up treating it with a steroid Prednisone. He had been on gout medicine Allopurinol a few years ago, but stopped it because of some other drug interactions and declining kidney function.   The gout attacks kept happening about once a month. For a uit or these severe gout attacks, they wanted us to bring Logan into the hospital. Each time he was admitted, he developed what we've been told is hospital dilerium. His mental state was already affected by being sick/in pain and loss of sleep. When admitted to the hospital, his Sundowner symptoms became alot worse. He became very angry and fought with the doctors and nurses, and needed to be sedated abd sometimes restrained for his safety. Sometimes they gave him Ativan and sometimes Seroquel or Zyprexa. These medications were usually needed to be administered later in the evening. We would go up to the hospital to sit with him and try and calm him down, but he would get angry and combative with us too, wanting to get dressed, out of bed and come home with us. If he continued being Restless and aggressive, he might get another dose later that night or early the next morning. After a few days of this treatment, he was so groggy he would sleep all day. And they would continue a regularly scheduled bedtime dose every day. Eventually after talking with the doctors extensively every day, we would explain that Logan's baseline behavior was completely independent living. He was still driving his truck at that time, going grocery shopping, to church, to the cemetery, and to visit friends. As Logan's wife's health declined the last year of her life, we noticed Logan's mental faculties were beginning to noticeably decline. He was losing things all the time. It was difficult to explain things to him. He didn't like wearing his glasses or hearing aides anymore, and his speech was getting mixed up and Hardee to understand. He didn't pass his drivers exam in 2022. The examiner could tell he wasn't completely clear headed, and he couldn't write his address and phone number anymore.  Still, Logan would gradually return to his normal baseline after a short hospital stay, when the doctors finally understood that on e ogan's immediate health issue that brought him in was cleared up, he started sleeping better on his own and didn't need any behavioral or anti aggression medication. He was still taking Melatonin and Trazodone at home to help him fall asleep. Last November, Logan has a fall and fractured a vertebrae. He was in the hospital for over 3 weeks recuperating. At that time, he was still struggling to get back to his baseline, not sleeping well and still in pain. He had to move into a senior assisted living facility. During that hospital stay, he was never taken off the Zyprexa. He was getting it as needed. We were talking withhis inpatient doctors (always a different inpatient team it seems), and assumed he would discontinue the Zyprexa when released. The discharge doctor changed the Zyprexa order to nightly when he went to the senior center. Logan struggled at the senior center. They had a difficult time with him. Struggling with recovering from his back injury. They tried inpatient, and after release at the senior center, to start physical therapy. But Logan was too sleepy all the time. So tired he was hardly eating anything. And he was having terrible diarrhea. He ended up back in the hospital because we thought with the diarrhea, and not sleeping or eating, that there must be something wrong still. He was dehydrated,  but it was the nightly Zyprexa making him tired all the time. So this last hospital stay, Logan had only been at the senior center about a month. Going back in the hospital, they found out he had Covid. Then it took them about 5 days to collect a stool sample to figure out why he was having such terrible diarrhea. I had to sit up with him all night one day and walk him myself to a bedside commode to catch a stool sample full of diarrhea, to finally find out that he had Salmonella poisoning as well. The senior center didn't think he hot it there, they blamed the hospital. And the doctors were saying Logan was a fall risk, so they wouldn't let him out of bed to go to the bathroom. So when Logan felt the need to pee or poop, he would suddenly be very awake and argue with the techs, nurses and room sitters - for hours, until he would have explosive diarrhea everywhere, on him, all over the bed, maybe spilling onto the floor. It's taken me spending several mornings and evenings with Logan showing the staff the symptoms of his behavior. He will be just waking up  or have just fallen asleep, when he will sit up and try to say somehow that he's going to pee the bed or make a mess. He's really hard to understand unless you realize what's going on. He will throw all his covers off, take off his diaper and hospital gown and try and crawl out of bed. He's pretty strong  It wasn't until about the middle of the 2nd week that I was reading the notes on his patient portal, and talking to the home aid that overheard a nurse - they had been giving Logan Haldol, then tried Zyprexa, then Seroquel  in increasing dosages, changing from one to the next when one medicine wasn't stopping his Restless aggressive behavior. We talk with staff every day and it says on his white board to call us if he's Restless or aggressive and we will come in and see if we can calm him down. I did a couple times, because I had called to check o. Him and they said he wasn't sleeping. Most nights they just medicated him. They never called me. I've thrown fits about it, anout changing meds without asking us, his POAs. And stopping the Trazodone. And changing the Seroquel from as needed to every night. And using antipsychotics, instead of maybe Ativan. Using the antipsychotics like a chemical restraint. He gets Restless and angry, and they medicate him. No med changes they've made have made the aggressive behavior go away. Sometimes if I come in and sit with him, he sleeps all night without needing extra meds. And his normal bedtime is 7pm. But they don't give him his night meds till about 9:30 or 10. And if he's still up at midnight or 1, he gets another dose. And so for a couple weeks now, he's been sleeping till 3pm. Can't get physical therapy. His doctor thinks he has advancing dementia  I've talked to him many times the last month about his broke back, moving to senior living center, refusing to go to the bathroom in bed, and a history of hospital dilerium. But he insists that they often have to medicate Logan at night because he gets so violent he sent one of their staff to the emergency room with injuries on her arm. That there's no time to call me in this situations because he's going to hurt someone.  Then I'll go in the next day and find out, they had somebody new on staff that night. A nurse or tech is sitter that knows nothing about Logan's history or behaviors. Only that they're getting calls about him grabbing people abd swinging at them. He is 89yrs old. He's practically deaf. He has Alzheimer's and can't understand most things you try and tell him. And he doesn't understand what they're doing to him when they come in his room, and he's mad because he wants to get out of bed, and has to use the bathroom.  I think it's unreasonable that any staff taking care of him or needing to be in his room, wouldn't know enough about the patient that he's confused, feels threatened, gets angry. And you should be able to talk to him calmly and keep him from getting out of bed, and call for help if needed. And not have to dope him up with antipsychotic medicines. That it's been documented in his records many times over the past several years don't really prevent the aggressive behavior, and make him too groggy. And they are FDA black labeled as dangerous to elderly dementia patients. Abd Logan and his family/POAs were not told about these risks and given a choice as to whether they would be used. And we are 15 min from the hospital and have said we would come in and sit with Logsn any time of night or day. But they never  call us. His primary care doctor and I reviewed his medication list and made changes taking jim off Zyprexa the day he was admitted. It was at that video visit that she thought he needed to go back in the hospital, but not be taking antipsychotics. Is there any way going forward, that I can talk with the geriatric department at his hospital or perhaps another one in the area, to agree on certain methods of treating Logan before he gets admitted again next time?",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/63929/inpatient-doctors-prescribe-antipsychotics-against-our-wishes-as-poas,,,AlzConnected-v2,2023-02-12 06:28:52,821436,1.0

I can add a few more stories like this:  Mary Knapp, 90, a resident at Beverly Health Care, is one of the dozens of participants in Loy’s study. Each day she wears on her sweater a heart-shaped patch scented with frankincense and grapefruit. Knapp described the scent as “mellow.” Knapp’s daughter, Mary Langston, of Greenville, said she has noticed a marked change in the past few weeks in her mother’s attention span and ability to better remember relatives in photographs and scrapbooks. “It’s been nice. It makes it so much easier to sit down and talk to her. As a child, you can’t imagine your parent’s not being able to remember things. But lately, it’s like she has been reborn,” Langston said. “She doesn’t get upset that she can’t remember things. Her attention span certainly has improved and she enjoys being around people more. Noises aren’t as disturbing for her.”  https://news.ecu.edu/2005/10/18/ecu-therapist-studies-links-between-scent-and-memory/ Benjamin Pearce bases his treatments on experience, rather than science.  Five years ago, he was desperate. He had a resident who was violent and agitated, not responding to any of the usual interventions. Cruising the Internet, Pearce happened on an aromatherapeutic oil called “Peace and Calming.”... The juxtaposition of odors it contains is strangely jarring—a strong bright citrus mixed with the deep musk of patchouli—and seems to activate conflicting repulsions and attractions, as well as a desire to sniff it again. Pearce purchased the oil, dabbed some on a handkerchief and put that in the pocket of his troublesome resident. He believes that the man, thanks to his dementia, quickly forgot about the source of the odor. Yet as the strange smell continued to waft up from his own shirt pocket, he seemed suddenly alert and more manageable. Aromatherapy is now a part of daily life for Pearce’s residents, from energizing citrus scents in the morning to calming lavender at night. https://scienceline.org/2011/03/lavender-and-old-lace/ To try to make bathing more pleasant, staff decided to heat the bathroom before taking her in and dry her off with towels fresh from the dryer. They also installed a rolling shade over the sink mirror, as Maggie appeared to be fearful when she saw the person in the mirror. Another strategy they tried was intensive aromatherapy. Caregivers rubbed the essential oil of lavender on her skin every two hours to surround her in a familiar and comforting scent. Just in case Maggie was experiencing some level of pain, Clairmont’s staff made sure one of the essential oils that eases muscle stiffness, joint pain, and aches was rubbed into her body first thing in the morning when the elderly tend to be most stiff and uncomfortable. Staff noticed she had difficulty finding the right word when she wanted to express herself, so they worked hard to understand the particular way her mind tended to find a certain kind of word when reaching to express a completely different one. All of this required intensive one-on-one time getting to know Maggie very well. Because Maggie so clearly needed comfort, staff took every opportunity to give her a warm hug or sit or walk with her, holding her hand so that she might feel less alone in this strange new world her brain had drawn her inexorably into. Staff discovered that Christian music gave her joy, so they played it for her frequently. A couple of weeks passed, and gradually Maggie became calmer and more at ease. Their efforts were so successful that Maggie was able to go entirely off the lethargy-inducing Ativan she had been taking three times a day. She doesn’t even need it PRN (as needed) anymore. Staff even discover, to their delight, glimpses of joy in Maggie’s eyes. https://www.providermagazine.com/Monthly-Issue/2012/Pages/0912/Maggie-A-Case-Study-In-Dementia-Care.aspx  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKN3DGxl06o https://archive.nytimes.com/newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/clearing-the-fog-in-nursing-homes/ https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4360/2008%20Evaluation%20of%20Aromatherapy%20in%20Insitutional%20Elder%20Care%20Settings.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Three of the greatest benefits of aromatherapy are greater responsiveness, more ease, and less fear.  The following clinical trials partially capture the improvements in being.  Methods: After a control period of 28 days, aromatherapy was performed over the following 28 days, with a wash out period of another 28 days. Aromatherapy consisted of the use of rosemary and lemon essential oils in the morning, and lavender and orange in the evening. To determine the effects of aromatherpay, patients were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Gottfries, Brane, Steen scale (GBSS-J), Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (FAST), a revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), and the Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) four times: before the control period, after the control period, after aromatherpay, and after the washout period. Results: All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular, patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores. Result of routine laboratory tests showed no significant changes, suggesting that there were no side-effects associated with the use of aromatherapy. Results from Zarit's score showed no significant changes, suggesting that caregivers had no effect on the improved patient scores seen in the other tests. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found aromatherapy an efficacious non-pharmacological therapy for dementia. Aromatherapy may have some potential for improving cognitive function, especially in AD patients. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1479-8301.2009.00299.x Background: Aromatherapy is a complementary and alternative therapeutic method that has attracted much attention worldwide. Based on the lack of clinical research on the application of aromatherapy in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in China, this study aimed to investigate the effect of aromatherapy in patients with AD.  Methods: 54 patients with AD were randomly allocated to aromatherapy groups and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. Eventually, 25 patients in the aromatherapy group (two participants discontinued midway) and 26 in the control group (one participant discontinued midway) completed the study. Both groups of patients received conventional treatment and nursing care, and the aromatherapy group received an hour of aromatic inhalation per day for 12 weeks,the control group inhaled only distilled water per day for 12 weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Brief Questionnaire form, Quality of LifeAlzheimer’s Disease, and four kinds of biochemical indicators were evaluated as outcome measures.  Results: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Brief Questionnaire Form scores decreased, the Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease score improved (P<0.05), the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum was slightly reduced, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced (P<0.05), and TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the aromatherapy group, compared to those of the control group.  Conclusion: Aromatherapy can improve sleep, alleviate psychobehavioural symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with AD, which may be related to reducing the level of oxidative stress in patients and inhibiting inflammatory factors; it is a non-drug intervention that can be widely applied. https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1392290/v1/f79b84f0-ba44-49fd-ace1-57fbb9eac13d.pdf?c=1652156064 Best Wishes to all of you, Lane",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/61658/more-on-aromatherapy,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-07-17 13:36:37,484272,254.0

My siblings and I don't know who her regular dentist was.  My mother was complaining of dental pain and we managed to take her to a dentist recommended by an aide at her day program. The dentist said she had an infected wisdom tooth. We've gotten evaluations from two oral surgeons: they both are reluctant to operate on her because of her age and her dementia. The first said, ""wait and see, and if it gets worse, let me know."" The other said he doesn't use anesthesia with anyone and referred us to an oral surgeon at Mass General who would be able to give anesthesia in a hospital setting. It's been difficult to get through the red tape to even talk to the Mass General oral surgeon. My mother is now taking the maximum amount of Tylenol she can. We got another round of antibiotics and Tylenol with codeine from the first oral surgeon, who will operate on her with only novocaine -- not even a sedative -- in four days. I've read posts here by caregivers who said the surgery and recovery was worth it because the infection/pain was worsening the dementia. And other posts about the difficulty of the recovery. I read on the Alzheimer's UK website that anesthesia might be harmful to dementia patients. Neither oral surgeon has discussed with us any of this -- the impact of anesthesia or the difficulty of recovery. My mother's geriatrician offered no help or insights.All he said was that he thought no oral surgeon would do anesthesia or nitrous gas, then walked it back when I questioned him on this. If anyone can tell me of any oral surgeons in the Boston area who have experience with people living with dementia and using anesthesia, nitrous gas, sedatives, etc, I would appreciate it. Any other insights or advice are welcome.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/61125/oral-surgery-risks,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-06-02 20:33:46,801819,3.0

Its been about 6-8 months since my mother has been, somewhat, diagnosed. Its been a real struggle learning the best way to care for her, and keep myself grounded. One of the most difficult aspects I deal with, is knowing where her mind is.  There are multiple times daily when we interact, she seems to remember what we discussed. In a second she doesn't. She'll constantly repeat the same things as if new. She likes to watch the same shows over and over. One minute she'll love it, the next she's irritated with the characters. She used to love crocheting, I bought everything she needs, but whenever I suggest she work on a blanket for one of my children she says, 'not right now but I will'. When I want to get her into the shower, same response, 'not right now, but I will', until I have to get upset to get her to bathe because she truly believes she already has. I'm now trying to learn how to crochet, as I have a new grandson. She came in, saw the yarn, remarked on how beautiful it was. I suggested she do it, that's why I bought it. Her response was she had no idea I ever had it.  I get her mind is broken, it's just so difficult when for a lot of the time, it seems she gets things. Then she'll say things that contradict what we've just been discussing, or she talks of the past, of the future, that never really was. Parts are grounded in reality, but the rest, not at all. My demeanor definitely affects her. I really strive to control my moods, because I know when I'm feeling anxious, stressed, unhappy, she feeds into it. I have nerve damage in my jaw that's affected by the barometric pressure, which lately has been really tough. When I'm going through the pain it's really hard to talk. She constantly asks what she can do, absolutely nothing, but she keeps asking and I don't think she realizes she just asked. I guess what I'm looking for here, is what others are dealing with, and how they deal with it. I know all of our situations are different, but there is an element of sameness.

We did manage to get a urine catch yesterday with a condom catheter so waiting on the results of that. Anyway, if the wheels are locked, he rocks back and forth violently, non stop. If we recline the chair with  his feet up, he still gets them off the side (it is not as bad), but the. He starts slamming his hand on the tray. If we take off the tray, he slams his hands on the side of the chair. If he doesn’t have a seatbelt fastened, he scoots until he is sitting on the footrest and does the same thing. If we undo the breaks, he rolls around and if he backs into a piece of furniture or wall he slams it hard, repeatedly, until we move him. If you mention to him he is going to break the furniture or wall is reply is “good” or he will tell us to just fix it, or just move it. So we obviously don’t bother trying to reason, lol. He will even slam into things in front of him, causing bruises to his knees. It’s crazy. The whole time he has his eyes closed, but he is not asleep. We try to redirect with fidget toys, talking, music, etc., but he wont stop. Anything we put in his hands (besides food), he just throws on the ground. It has progressively gotten worse over these past few weeks and his crashing is more violent. I have started adding pain medicine to see if that helps any. He had a tiny bit of morphine yesterday prior to them putting the condom catheter on him and he did not do the bumper chair nearly as bad - which really makes me think it’s pain. He says he doesn’t have pain, but he has always said that, even right after surgery. So, I can’t rely on that. I wonder too if it’s the new prostate medicine  (in the past Tamulosin made him berserk, and it’s a similar kind of med). If it’s the med, it’s a real catch 22 because he needs it to be able to empty his bladder during the day. Is this progression? Did anyone else’s LO do this? If so, how did they treat it?

1676,647b5913091b6ef899d1ca00,61594,,"From SO scared, to super sad, back to my baseline (numb)","I hope everyone has some joy and relaxation today. The last couple of weeks at our house were so crisis-filled I felt almost guilty posting more bad news, plus had trouble even catching my breath to post about some of this, so did not. My challenges are not nearly as tough as what some of our forum mates have had to deal with recently, so my heart goes out to everyone else who is also scared, sad, numb, or just done. Here is an update and also some questions interspersed (maybe unasked) -- so feel free to share any feedback or suggestions if you want. I have spent much of the nearly 4 years since diagnosis literally numb, with breakthrough periods of sharp emotions or just realizing and naming what I am feeling at any given time in response to this journey we are on.  You all know the rollercoaster of experiences (crises) and corresponding emotional swings we caregivers go through. Two nights ago I almost posted that I was SO scared, terrified honestly at what felt in the moment like the 3rd or 4th recent near death experience with my DH. (Almost choking to death on food; acute asthma attack; unresponsive and seizure-like in the bathroom; and most recently another sudden vaso-episode of passing out with me trying to hold him upright or let him down to the floor gently without one or both of us breaking something). In those moments it is terrifying to see how close he is to being gone with me helplessly watching - trying to figure out how to keep him comfortable and pain free as possible, while dialing hospice emergency for coaching -- as each of these episodes has been a ""1st"" except the most recent one.  I did not post the acute fear of watching what looked like his final minutes, yet again.  I paused as the adrenaline subsided after he stabilized, and a wave a deep sadness swept in. I know that one of these times, possibly soon, it really will be the last time. That extreme sadness emerged along with exhaustion so I just went to sleep alongside DH. And woke up numb again. Numb I know quite well. That's been my baseline for a long time now since right about the time I joined this forum. It protects somewhat from the trauma I guess. At least for now. Today I am just relaxing. He seems not to be in pain, and the swelling is down a bit. His asthma finally cleared up the first week with new hospice team due to their med changes and equipment support. Here is a recap of our week and current status. Any experience or suggestions welcomed.   Progression to 6e. Using more gloves than ever before. Need a diaper-pail smell antidote. (added): Tremors increasing causing violent shaking of hands and splashing of food and beverages, but DH is so resistant to assistance we are wrestling things or he clams up. (and won't drink the liquid to take his meds, etc. Some can be crushed, others cannot.) Sudden swelling of his jaw and chin on one side yesterday alerting me to a dental emergency. Tried to look inside as told by his nurse but got bitten. Not on purpose I don't think - he doesn't understand my words and is generally not compliant especially with anything related to his body. It looked like he was pocketing food its so big, but there is no food there. So, I think it is related to the molar that broke off a few weeks back. His new hospice prescribed oral antibiotics and pain meds starting last night. (I saw an older post from Iris about abcesses and the meds may not help). Doc also said get hydrogen peroxide to rinse after eating (I'm housebound and can't leave him nor drag him to the car) so I tried it with Listerine, but he doesn't understand ""swish and spit"" into the bowl. Kept swallowing it. So no. And a 2nd fainting episode of DH passing out in the john - this time after standing, before I could get his briefs and pants up and back to bed.  We are really lucky neither of us has been injured. I'm truly very grateful for that. I was able to use the oxygen for the first time, and he stabilized.   It is good that the 2nd hospice company enrolled him right after the original one discharged him. Otherwise I would not have had the rollator at the ready, fall mats on the floor, o2 machine and training, or 24/7 nurse on call to talk me through what the heck to do. ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/61594/from-so-scared-to-super-sad-back-to-my-baseline-numb,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-07-10 10:17:50,695024,760.0

His mental health has improved enough where home health graduated him today from having severe mental ability loss to moderate. He also has graduated from puree food to soft foods.  There is a but where I am torn. In May he had the hip pinning surgery after falling out of the bed at the nursing home. At times I wonder if it was successful because he never regained the ability to walk and he is in constant pain. His hip and knee. I can really tell it is at a ten when trying to move him to get out of bed or turn him in bed.  So now I wonder if I should see if he needs something corrected with the hip or knee or go to inpatient therapy. Inpatient therapy is what the home health nurse recommends. Home x-rays were requested but the doctor wants us to bring him in instead. We go the x-rays tomorrow.   The other situation. Now that things have improved, he is refusing to use it in the diapers first and second. I mean he is keeping the diaper on thankfully but is demands to use the potty. If I try to ask him to handle the old way or can't get him up, he is holding it in. Now I'm like don't cause yourself constipation. We have the urinal but no one in the area has a bedpan. Now I'll order that and see if he will use. Today he called for his daughter that lives here to come help and she did not move. I pleaded with him to just use the diaper and I would immediately clean him. I'll mess up the bed if you don't get me to the potty he says. I tried to console saying we would take care of everything.  I've been able to get him up some but when it is time to get him back in bed it's hell because he is afraid of falling and starts freaking out on you and starts leaning back instead of coming up.  If we get the leg close, he would still need supervision. The aid they brought in last week to help me has been great so far but she leaves at 8 in evening. Then today my brother decides he wanted to put his hands on me because he wants to me to gift this and that of dads or have dad pay for things other want for the home. I tried to explain medicaid rules and remind of guardianship rules. I thought I had found a workaround where all would be happy but he was just not having it. Grabbed me and shook me until he got my phone out my hand because he thought I was recording. Called me the b word over and over.

My phone glitched and website didn’t save the nearly finished draft. So I will do the Cliff Notes version.  * Minor grossness alert *  I thought it was the end of the line on Friday. DH had some real agitation starting early in a.m. (3a to be exact) which is not his current pattern. Also rude to me & ignoring new CNA. So much cranky behavior I asked if his tooth hurt “no”, if he felt ok- “no”, did something hurt “just don’t feel too good” and at one point to more questions about pain, “yeah, my butt” (hurts). He had uncharacteristic irregularity (2 days) and did not respond to Senna. Finally was able to “go” a bit. Before this I could have set my clock by this man’s 1x daily BM so it seems part of progression, not diet or meds. After continued bloating and multiple long trips to toilet (we spend way too much time in there daily anyway...) he started jerking and limbs shaking or having spasms, looked like he was in a trance then unresponsive and then seemed to be passing out. On the toilet. I shook him and called his name til he came to, but then he broke out in a profuse cold sweat.  I was pretty much panicking, called hospice on speaker (never got anyone) & was able to finally get him on his feet by tilting the back of the commode frame a bit and having him lean on me til we got his pants up. The rollator was just outside the bathroom and made it 12 feet to the bed. Seemed back to baseline. Fast forward - by Monday when nurse came she confirmed this was not a stroke or seizure as I had feared. He was impacted (learned about that here just days before it happened!) and straining to push so hard he got the poop out, but dropped his blood pressure. Was literally fainting and DH’s nurse says there is a major nerve there that can also contribute to this phenomenon while sitting on the toilet too long. Get this- it can be fatal.  That’s what I was seeing occur and it scared the crap out of me as well. This seems to be part of our intro to 6e.

My mom was only recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's (January 2022), but my dad has provided me with little information.  I speak to both of them regularly on the phone, but my dad can't answer questions like what stage the doctors believe she might be in, what medications she is on, etc.  I'm unsure if that's because he isn't asking, he doesn't remember, or if he doesn't want to pass the info along.  My dad has generally communicated that she is doing well, with good/bad days of course.  But over the past month, he indicated that things had ""accelerated"" (his words).  Hallucinations, sleep disruption, and one wandering episode.   Then last week, my dad (who is now 81) called me to tell me that he thought mom needed to go into a nursing home.  This felt like it came out of nowhere.  I asked questions like how he would take her there, what facility he was thinking about, etc.  But at that point, he didn't have many answer and just said that he was looking into options.  Then 24 hours ago he told me that he is taking her to a combination nursing/assisted living facility on Monday.  He has not told my mom and doesn't intend to.  I ask questions like what has prompted this, is this a memory care facility, what is the plan if there is a major incident, etc.  He has no answers.  My mom is coherent and engaged when I speak to her on the phone.  She knows who I am.  She answers my questions.  While there is confusion on her end, and I am clearly not there everyday to see what is happening as far as what dad may be dealing with, this seems like a very fast decision on his part.  I'm unsure if he's intentionally not telling me about some major episodes, or if her decline is really this drastic, or if he's just tired.  Or maybe it's all of the above.  My dad isn't necessarily the best communicator and I tend to struggle in that department as well.   When I ask for specifics about her behavior, all my dad can say is that she ""won't listen to him"" or ""take his advice/suggestions.""  But he won't/can't give me any more information.  I am their only child.  My half-sister ""D"" (mom's daughter by first marriage) passed away unexpectedly years ago.  ""D"" had several children (my nieces/nephews), but I am only recently again in contact with one niece ""C"" (who has dealt with some personal issues I'll keep private).  There are only a few other family members on my mom's side that I could contact, and most of them haven't seen her in years either.  I don't know where to start or what to do.  My maternal grandmother also had Alzheimer's, but I was very young at the time of her diagnosis & subsequent decline and do not remember very much about her progression.  And even if I did, that doesn't mean that my mom's progression would be the same. I do not want to disregard what my dad may be dealing with, but feel like this is a huge leap into a nursing/assisted living situation.  Even if I jumped on a plane tomorrow (which isn't doable due to work right now), I don't know that I can stop anything from happening.  Or even if I should.   Any ideas on where to start?  What to do?  I'm completely lost.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/61325/no-idea-what-to-do,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-06-18 11:31:12,803411,6.0

She lives/d in our home, and there were some pretty rough moments at the end until we got her meds figured out, but eventually she was able to be comfortable and peaceful (thank God for hospice!!!)

A couple years ago when DH was early into stage 5 he kept asking when his dental appointment was.  He never said he had a bad tooth but when the appointment came it turned out that he had a wisdom tooth that needed pulling.  We were referred to a dental surgeon.  Turns out that afterwards he developed a ""dry"" socket which created pain and we wound up making several check up trips to the surgeon's office until it finally healed.   A year later another wisdom tooth needed pulling.  We were very careful this time to do everything possible to avoid another dry pocket.  And thankfully were successful. And then early this year  a cap came off a different tooth and had to be put back on.  Several months later the same cap came off again.  At first I wondered if the problem was the dentist.  But the next day I saw my husband bite down on a rather large radish.  Historically I haven't bought radishes a lot.  But DH was recently diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease and I have had to eliminate salt as much as possible.  The radishes were an attempt to offer a salt free ""treat"".   I never dreamed they could cause a different problem. But now I am on ""high alert"" to ensure that there are no radishes, nuts and other hard foods around. Makes it hard because he is already on a diabetic diet as well as kidney friendly.  If there is one saving grace, it's that he doesn't remember what he had for his last meal and so I can repeat the same menu quite often.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/61948/dental-awareness,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-08-10 11:22:11,804135,23.0

I called the support line and they suggested I post something here to get some peer feedback. Has anyone needed to have their parent have dental extractions. My 84 year old mother needs a few extracted in a few different sessions. Actually several teeth have fallen out and many have broken off in her mouth since diagnose last year. Her mouth is a mess. Mom is on the cusp of early to mid-stage Alzheimer's based on what I read and her MMSE score. Her normal neurologist, which we have only had for 6-months is on maternity leave and I have concerns on my mom's reaction and what to give her to sedate her or possibly put her under. I have concerns with general anesthesia from what I have read and I don't think she would sit still through it without jerking if not under some sedation or something.  I need help with: - Recommendations for trusted oral surgeons in the south bay that know how to deal with Alzheimer's patients and their needs and risks.  - Suggestions on something safe to possibly just sedate an Alzheimer's patient with vs having to put my mom under General Anesthesia.  My mom does not remember things long and we have discussed the need to remove her broken off teeth as it will affect her heart. We just got her dental insurance this year as she did not have it last year. She developed an abcessed tooth and we needed to take her in as she had fever, swelling and severe pain in her mouth. Despite telling her she needs her teeth removed she screamed at the surgeon that she was not allowing any teeth to be pulled. (we have medical right of attorney for her). In addition, my mom had an episode of vasovagal syncope (passing out) while in the office with the surgeon as well. And my mom has tons of antibiotic allergies and the surgeon is concerned about doing procedure on her. Essentially the fainting and non-responsive issue freaked the surgeon out even though I explained it happens from time to time and I just needed to get her flat. The surgeon indicated she does not do extraction under general anesthesia and if my mom moves she cannot help her. I am thinking many likely do that and that research is next on my list. I was told I would have to either go to the ER and tell them my mom needs teeth extracted, a hospital (but to whom), or a single specialist in SF bay area in SF to get this done. I feel deflated and I'm grappling for where to go next as I feel they are just kind of turning us away. We asked mom's primary care doc for a prescription for something to calm her down and she said mom is good for general anesthesia to be put under but I am reading that can have possible big side effects on memory going forward. And driving her to SF and supposedly only one oral surgeon does that does not seem right to me.  - Has anyone who has had this situation have any recommendations you can share for dental extractions for a nervous patient.  - Anyone have an oral surgeon they trust and would recommend? I'm working between this oral surgeon, my mom's primary care who I do not know if she understands the risk for Alzheimer's and her back-fill neurologist as our is out on maternity leave.

When he runs out he is angry, verbally abusive and has gone on drinking binges; the last binge was October 2021. He does not listen to me when I tell him that smoking anything is not good for him, his vascular surgeon also directed him to stop smoking. I would like him to go into an extended stay substance abuse rehabilitation facility to see if his EOA is possibly being pushed by the marijuana. If anyone has ideas who I should speak with on his care team to try to get him help I would appreciate it.

Also for the most part, the 20 and 30 somethings had no idea how to interact with her.  My vision of a beautiful family gathering was a bit low but nevertheless I was very happy we were all in the same place.  Helped me visit with everyone at least.  Me Me Me! Then, she apparently was in pain or stressed or who knows because she had a syncope episode in her chair. I was just in the kitchen for a moment.  The kids thought she had fallen asleep, kind of giggled. After seeing her head down, I took a look at her eyes and nope, not asleep, eyes were open but she was absent.  I just explained that “she’s ok, but this is a thing..”.  Took her inside and tipped her back in the chair with the handles on the second step of the stairs so her feet would be higher than her heart, until she came back to us.  Of course the kids were a bit horrified and probably wondered if she would die right there.  I knew better but the kids, not, ugh.  So, that was a lose/lose activity.  I apologized to mom, got her back home to her bed where she was much more comfortable.  I was able to get the generation pic back at her house while in her bed.  Learned a few more things that day which makes it not a total loss.   So now I struggle since she’s “bed bound.”  She seems to sometimes express some type of complaint of doing nothing, of just sitting there.  But I know she doesn’t want to get up, not really.  I don’t know if I should try to get her up at all or not?  Not knowing how to engage her or what she wants is the hardest part for me right now. So… there’s a 4th birthday party Sunday for one of her great grandchildren at a park.  I usually don’t have relief on Sundays so I actually thought maybe I could take her.   What in the h*** am I thinking.  Yeh, lets have a syncope episode at the park in front of itty bitties and the public.  geesh! I think about some of you that have considered or actually traveled with your LO for festivities and I only went around the block.  Well another fail for our adventure.  At least I’m wiser again or maybe not so stubborn or selfish.   ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/62267/well-i-did-it,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-09-02 12:42:45,736589,1012.0
1687,647b59dc091b6ef899d1d3e6,62324,,Searching for Ideas To Calm my Grandmother during extreme Confused Episodes,"(For the specific question I’m hoping to find advice for, please skip over the first paragraph that provides a bit of background leading to why I am seeking help).   My grandma is my favorite person in the world. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s years after her first signs and symptoms because her family (her husband and 3 kids) have their own issues I won’t get into. She needed 24/7 care at least three years ago and has had multiple hospitalizations, including broken bones and plastic surgeries, injured herself due to hallucinations and was even found wondering the streets early morning hours by neighbors walking home from the train. My mom finally fought for and won health proxy last year and since then there has been 24/7 care. However, after my recent visit I noticed how accelerated her decline has become. The aides are wonderful with her, but her memory, confusion and frustration and shockingly her sudden fierce defiance, have caused her more mental anguish than I can allow so I took a year away from my passion, teaching, to move in with my grandma and help with her bad days and episodes. I don’t know what stage she is in, but most days she can’t remember the last 5 minutes, most of her life’s memories, most people she knew well, always thinks people that have psssed are coming over and has not noticed her husband passed 6 months ago. When I write that out, I realize she could be described as mostly confused but still enjoying most of the moments of her day because we have learned how to manage this and she has such an optimistic outlook and sweet disposition it’s rare for her to be anything but happy. She finally received 24/7 care last year and the care givers are wonderful, but after recent visits have noticed she is experiencing more anxiety-driven confusion, and even anger that only I can help with. So I moved in with her and have been helping the aids but recently she is having episodes where she is so far removed from reality, AND IS AWARE OF IT, which is heart breaking. My strategies have been redirecting, reassuring she is okay, fibleting (I think that’s a term I saw on here) and taking her to the backyard where we just hold hands as long as she needs. The past few episodes have been drastically different in nature and none of that works. I am desperate for ideas on how to bring her calm (not even reality) when she is disoriented, mentally anguished and is aware something is wrong but can’t verbalize it. All she says is, “Liz please help me I’m so confused,” over and over. Twice it’s turned to rage and kicking people out of her house which is obviously a safety issue.  It’s 6:00 am right now and I’m making her a scrap book of family because she has always loved and prioritized family all her life. I want to write a note like, “I know you are confused right now but I promise that you’re safe and okay and your mind is just playing tricks on you.”  Thoughts on the scrapbook? Better wording for the note? Any other ideas to bring someone out of a really bad episode than I mentioned above? I gave up my passion for teaching in the inner city this year to dedicate my time to providing her comfort and figuring out how to make her life as happy and enjoyable as possible while she is still able to find the joy. Which she DEFINITELY does still on a daily basis but these moments are horrible and heartbreaking and getting worse I know where this is going, but just really need someone to hear my prayer for ideas that can take away some of the confusion and pain in these moments. Literally anything suggestions to make her life better is deeply and genuinely so very much appreciated.  Thanks for listening and to those who offer insights, -A loving granddaughter with the time to dedicate to make her days easier and ensure she continues to find joy in life as long as she can ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/62324/searching-for-ideas-to-calm-my-grandmother-during-extreme-confused-episodes,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-09-09 05:30:27,762720,1.0

1690,647b59ee091b6ef899d1d4c4,62043,,Estranged mother with dementia,"My mother was very difficult for many years. She is affected by an alcoholic family, unresolved trauma, and possibly a personality disorder, and was very hard on me, including repeated specific patterns of harm over time. A few years ago, it was clear to her that she was becoming demented, and being in the healthcare industry, I agreed she had many warning signs. Two and a half years ago, she did something so abusive that I was beyond pain, emotionally speaking.  On the one hand, counselors had been telling me for years to terminate my relationship with her, and this situation was terrifying and excruciating and involved putting others in harm's way. On the other hand, the situation involved a particularly intense episode of poor judgement and some repetitive behavior and extreme paranoia that made me think that dementia was playing a role. I left her with my wellbeing and that of my then-fiance in mind, while also being aware that the participation of my father and sister in shielding my mother from consequences meant that there was very little I could do to rectify this dangerous situation. Since then, I've married and had a baby, and I persist in prioritizing the wellbeing of my immediate family. OTOH, I am aware that my mother is likely to decline, and that, given her severe unresolved trauma, her disease course with dementia is likely to be rough at best. In addition, I realize my father and sister are very likely to remain emotionally entangled with her BS in a way that may put her in harm's way, and very likely would result in my being asked to absorb more of the same abuse I've been taking from them all since my childhood. The reality is that I just can't. I have no more care to give. I cannot accept any more risk. I feel numb and empty toward her. I have spent half of my expected lifespan in the grip of her abuse, and I just cannot take it any longer -- especially since any hope of things improving or even staying stable is gone. And yet I feel bad for abandoning my ill, elderly parent. I called the care consultant and they said not to go to support groups because most people are in relationships with their loved ones and are not coping with a situation like mine. I understand that response but feel very alone. The reality of dementia for me is that there will be no improvement, that my mother will never acknowledge what she did or how it hurt me, that she'll never be safe enough to meet my baby, that my kid doesn't have a grandmother. I think that kind of grief is common to a lot of dementia diagnoses.

About 4 weeks ago, the staff had a hard time getting her to sit to eat, and to go to bed at night.  If they did get her in bed, sometimes she'd be back walking the hallways in just a few minutes.  She started speed-walking in the hallways.  And her balance was off, so she started falling and getting bruises.  She was hugging herself so hard that she had fingerprint bruises on her arms.  One afternoon, she fell twice in a short time.  She was transported to the hospital.  UTI.  They admitted her because she was still off balance.  Well, her anxiety shot through the roof.  After 2 days, her balance was back, and she was speed-walking & dragging 2 nurses through the hall, trying to find the way out.  They tweaked some meds.  She was still walking pretty well when she went back to the Memory Care facility.  (By the way, on Margie's most stressful day, I was with Margie when I got a call from a doctor in the ER, talking about my mom.  You mean my sister.  No, my mom.  She was admitted 2 days after Margie, with a UTI and a swollen kidney that we were already investigating.  She was discharged with a tube draining her swollen kidney.  She needs round the clock care/supervision which was me for Labor day weekend.) Back to Margie.  She started falling again.  She fell out of bed.  We took her bed frame away and put the bed on the floor.  I got her a weighted wrap (not quite a blanket), and 2 weighted capes.  She is off balance while walking, so now she sits in a wheelchair all the time.  Her speech is soft and mostly garbled.  Although, she did clearly tell me the other day that she is ""terrified all the time"".  She looks away from people who are talking to her.  Her eyes are usually half-closed.  She yelled in pain when I moved her closer to the table today, and I made sure not to bump her feet.  She doesn't eat much.  She's so thin.  Mom wants to see her, but I kind of wanted to wait until Mom's IV bruises went away.  (Margie didn't know Mom was in the hospital.)  Now, I don't want Mom to see Margie.  I hate this. I know I have Margie in the right place, though.  Would you believe that one of the staff members is coming in on her day off on Monday to help me get Margie to her appointment?  I can't get her there by myself when she is so unsteady.   Gothic, I saw your post.  It sounds like your sister is somewhat ""stable"".  I'm glad to hear it. Oregano, I saw your comment in Gothic's post about mold.  I heard about that for the first time last week.  Monday, I'm taking Margie to see the doctor that talked to me about it.  She's going to test Margie.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/62376/a-giant-rough-patch,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-09-13 22:44:00,718096,23.0

Through consultation with the psych NP, we have increased her dosage several times over the past seven months.

She's no longer walking, but she isn't bed-bound. She is up in her chair and visiting with others on a regular basis.  She has had a long-standing cough (last ~3 years) which was treated as a swallowing coordination issue. She was evaluated and followed by speech therapy and has been on and off a softened diet multiple times. Currently she's on a honey thick regimen. Mostly she eats liquids or liquified foods (like shakes, ice creams, purees.) Periodically over the last year, I've been with her during some distressing sputtering and choking episodes. They always happened in the setting of having eaten or had a drink. Today she had a violent choking episode that came out of the blue. We were sitting there holding hands quietly, not speaking, and she coughed a few times lightly and then suddenly was choking, gasping, sputtering. It was clear from her expression that she was in pain and terrified. (Fortunately, she seems to forget the fear once the distress has passed.) Her nurse gave an under-the-tongue medication to dry secretions (Hyocyamine sulfate.) She gets it as needed and that seems to be every couple of days right now. It's not preventive, but as needed. Can anyone who's been down this path tell me what happens next? Today's episode shook me up. It's never been so violent or hard on her as it was today. I understand that pneumonia is a risk but what about choking to death? Should she be sleeping upright? I'm a very worried daughter tonight.

So, in his chair, we have to use a seatbelt to keep him sitting upright enough to eat.  It goes between his legs and around his waist much like a baby car seat. When he finishes eating, we undo it and he scoots down immediately to almost a full laying down position (it doesn’t matter if the chair is an upright position or reclining he scoots down until his bottom is nearly off the chair) He does this in any chair or recliner or bed. Then he tries to scoot back up but can’t. As soon as I pull him up, he is down again in a minute. (As a side note, if we do not use the seatbelt, he slides down until the tray is nearly at his chin - not good for eating or safety!) Anyway, when our caregiver helper was late today (eventually a no-show) I got him changed and cleaned up and was going to start him on drinking his juice while still in bed until she got there to help transfer him. Well, as soon as I raised the head of the bed, he scooted down until he was flat again. He said he wanted to eat, but I could not get him to stay in an upright position to eat in bed. I moved him up several times but could not even grab the cup before he was down again.  It is not a weakness thing, he is using his arms and legs to scoot himself down. He’s not sliding down. I’ve seen him use his arms to push up to sitting and even try to stand. So, as I think about the future, what in the world do we do when he is bedridden and still wants to eat? How do we keep him from scooting down? We have tried raising the feet, but then he just scoots sideways u til he is flat again. Also, any ideas why he is doing this? He’s been doing it ever since his surgery in January. He does not complain of pain but obviously this is the most comfortable position for him. ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/60964/scooting-down-question,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-05-20 21:41:25,768251,758.0

1702,647b5a42091b6ef899d1d8cf,59618,,Big move tomorrow...I need strength!!,"Hello all!  I’ve read about every post I could the last 5 months and appreciate everyone who is dealing with this awful condition and the advice and support you give. Back story - Mom was showing signs of cognitive impairment for the last 3 years, while living in her own home (30 mi away) and caring for my adult brother who has Down syndrome. She refused all suggestions and appointments made by her doctor to go to a memory care clinic. I saw a huge decline during the pandemic where she was forgetting everything short term and also long term. I made myself sick with worry and ended up with high blood pressure. I contacted my brother’s day program and told them of my concerns and to contact me if they had any inkling of something wrong with my brother. Both had loss significant weight and she was not showering or changing clothes for almost a year. The more I begged and pleaded for her to get help the more she distanced herself from me. Then I got the call from his program..he hadn’t been there in 2 days,she didn’t call and cancel him which was abnormal and the first day they called and asked her she said she had no idea why he wasn't there. Second day they couldn’t reach her. I went to her home and she could barely move ,was groaning in pain. Brother said she hadn’t fed him in 2 days. She refused still to go to Dr or hospital. I called her Dr who MHA’d her to hospital. She was severely dehydrated,septic, and had pneumonia. She was also formerly diagnosed with dementia. The hospital doc,SW, and her PCP all stated she needed 24hr care and that I needed to place her in a facility. She begged me not to and emotions were running very high. I was newly retired so I brought her home with me and my family and also my brother. Needless to say, it has been a long 5 months! We have had some great quality time together, taking walks, laughing and reminiscing on her childhood, she remembers nothing of my life. It has also been very hard living with both her and my brother. Neither one can be left alone so we’ve hired a caregiver to come for two hrs twice a week, she is very resentful of that and rude to the caregiver. I’ve missed out on my teen sons basketball games and outings with the family. We used to walk every evening as a family and tried to do it with them to no avail. Anyways, I spent months looking for just the right place for my mom to go. Finally found an ALF with a wonderful MC attached. Move in day is tomorrow!!! I was not going to tell her until tomorrow but just didn’t feel right about it. My husband and I have been there the last 2 days for several hours hooking up tv,hanging shelves and photos, making it warm and cozy for her. She asked today where husband was so I told her getting your new apartment perfect for you. She said but I am going home not to an apartment. In the past I would’ve said the drs won’t let you go home without 24hr care but this has upset her very much (she has anosognosia). This time I said your home is needing too many repairs (very true) and they can’t all be done in the winter (not quite true) so this is a temp place for you to go. She asked if my bro could go with and I said no because it is for seniors. She asked why she couldn’t stay with me which broke my heart. I told her I thought it would be fun for her to be around others who want to participate in lots of activities like she does. At first she said it felt like her body was being zapped all over. I just said I’m so sorry you aren’t happy about this, we are trying our very best to make you happy. I said I met her new neighbor who was hoping she liked bingo because she needs a new partner. Well that lit her right up, she said she loved bingo and hoped it wouldn’t cost extra. So far so good, now she is peacefully reading in front of the fireplace. A huge weight has been lifted, I was feeling so scared about springing this on her at the last second. Still feel a bit defeated that I couldn’t keep her here but it’s not working for my very active family. My brother is waiting, unbeknownst to them, for a group home which could take a year but at least the ball is rolling. I’m afraid tomorrow will be very emotional but hopeful she will love it eventually. I’ve battled with guilt that I’m not doing enough but as I’ve read here maybe it’s really grief. I’ve also appreciated those that have said I’m not doing this to her but for her. I wanted so bad to arrange for her to be in her own home but couldn’t figure out how to do that safely and economically.  Sorry for the extra long post just needed to get this off my chest.

1703,647b5a49091b6ef899d1d92a,59577,,Difficulty staying awake after surgery,"A little background, so you can see where FIL was pre surgery -  FIL was placed in a memory care facility in May, at the time he went in, he was somewhat communicative, could handle grooming, toileting, physically healthy, etc. He was enjoying the place, the food, caregivers, activities, and had made friends.  Several events happened that may have led to major declines in his cognition (or maybe he is just progressing rapidly, who knows) scabies which sounds innocent enough, but the daily applications of creams were very upsetting. Soon after, he started pushing and hitting other residents, and walking became unsteady with a left foot drop. Spent some time in the hospital to rule out physical causes, then spent about 3 weeks in a mental health facility to figure out some medication to help him calm down. That was September. On the new medicines, he definitely had more confusion and sleepiness, but was also calmer and less agitated. He still enjoyed the company of his friends and us when we visited, which was about every other day. He still knew us. He started becoming incontinent and required help bathing. He still fed himself, but hands were shaking and had to eat more with his fingers. Then the facility flooded in November and all the memory care residents had to be moved to a new facility temporarily. That was traumatic for all of them and very poorly done. The new facility is not well run and they did not have staff to handle the surge of new residents. Some of them were not unpacked for days  He had some new behaviors starting in December. Walking with a shuffle, bending his head way forward. We asked for a doctor and PT consult but all we got was blood work (we have several issues with this place and the new nurse that I won’t go into). The last few weeks we received a call that he was walking too fast. He would hop up and walk at a very quick pace but was still unsteady. He fell, broke his hip. He has no other comorbidities (physically healthy) He is now in the hospital- he had surgery a week ago, not a full hip replacement, just enough to be mobile again. He had to have general anesthesia . He also has a UTI. It has been a week and he is still very difficult to wake up. He falls asleep being fed (has to be awoken between bites) , he falls asleep during PT. He cannot sit up or stand up without 2 people. He can only respond  with yes or no, and even then it is not clear he understands the question. He is showing in a lot of pain urinating, but the blood work shows no infection. He is not constipated.  In his sleep “state” he is talking, laughing, reaching for things, he is constantly wadding up his bed sheets. So, my concern is - how do you know whether this is still coming out of anesthesia or this is the dying phase? How will they make the determination whether he needs rehab or hospice? Our plan is to rent hospital bed and other equipment bring him here and have rehab or hospice at our home. We have a sitting area in our bedroom which is a good set up for this and a sheet hung for privacy. I have some experience taking care of my mom who had ALS - so I worked with lifts, repositioning, transfers, bathing, injections, iv fluids and meds, and such. She also had PT for a while, for comfort not rehab. I am home 24/7 as is my grown son, and my husband can do a lot of work from home. We have one doctor telling us to keep him out of rehab because they are not equipped for dementia and his needs may not be met. We have another who is saying rehab center is better because they will work with him every hour. I can work with him every hour, moving his legs (whatever exercises they tell me) and I can help a visiting PT get him standing and DH and I can do it when he’s home as well. Is there a lift that can help with standing? (I have not used one like that, only for transfer). I’m sure they will rx a visiting nurse as well - I’m guessing once a week?  If it is time for hospice, I am hoping DH will be willing for us to do this at home as well. I know his dying wish would be at home with family.

I noticed that my mom was pocketing food when she was sleepy, so I asked that since her behavior issues seemed to subside to remove the Seroquel.  She still seemed sleepy so I also asked them to stop the low dose morphine they were giving her.  This was prescribed because the aids were having a hard time dressing her without her being in pain.  She has been in a wheelchair since her arrival to the nursing home 3 years ago.  She just forgot how to walk. I decided to have her food downgraded to purée because with the nursing homes being short staffed I worried about my mom being fed too fast and choking. She also starting coughing once while I was feeding her a McDonald’s hamburger and then threw up.  I did not think anything of this because after she coughed she sneezed 5 times in a row.  Thought it might be because she sneezed at the same time and has a reflex spasm. Yesterday I gave her a milk shake and she had no problems drinking or coughing, but did start sneezing.  She does seem to have some post nasal drip as she has had this all her life from sinus issues.

I also mixed spoons of yogurt too.  She was doing fine and then I gave her a drink and a few minutes later she coughed and began sneezing.  Then she started gagging and threw up.  I was so scared because I never seen her gag like that.  Then she stopped and said she was fine.  Nurse took her temp if was normal.  Although she seemed tired.

1706,647b5a66091b6ef899d1da9a,59978,,Shock of my life (x2),"Part 1: I wrote a long post earlier, chronicling our latest adventure. It reported a happy ending but really a mystery and when I went to post, it disappeared. Didn't have much more time to leave DH to his own devices so I elected not to retype it at the time. All's well that ends well, though! The short version is, he somehow accomplished a feat I thought well beyond him (got out and back into a recliner + locking tray that was comfortably latched with a full tray of food in front of him, intended to keep him occupied while I ran a quick errand). I returned to find him exactly as I had left him, but with a bowl of his favorite cereal and fresh blueberries halfway finished (what? How?!) That wasn't part of the feast I had laid out before strapping him in and it was my only clue that he had budged from my carefully planned safe space while unsupervised. Hmmm. That shocking sight taught me that even 19 minutes alone is too long to leave him again. Ever. I was counting my blessings that he didn't get into trouble, or fall, or wander, while I made a super-rare trip a few blocks away to retrieve an urgent med refill. Wish we had cameras to monitor as I really still can't figure out how he did that. Part 2: Within a few minutes of 'note to self' marveling at how DH accomplished something quite complex, meaning he might attempt just about anything independently -- and not be so successful next time -- and I do mean within minutes of this private thought process, DH went from content, to feisty, to testy, to unsteady and on the ground in a slow motion fall that scared me more than I can say. Its the second time in 4 months that I've watched him fall away from me, land hard on his side (and this time roll to his stomach) but be unable (or unwilling?) to get up.  Each time I hold my breath as he's going down, beat myself up that I couldn't stop the fall, and pray to the heavens he doesn't break something. We are lucky. He did not. But I could only get him to his knees holding onto a chair seat where he stopped and decided to take a nap. What went through my head was everything from did he have a stroke/TIA?, is he in pain, is there an invisible injury that we can't see? Is this the beginning of the end...? Feeling shocked in a different way right now. Post-firefighters' lift assist, we are both propped up in bed, just chilling. But I am worried and also feeling like a terrible caregiver. All I really have to do is keep his meds filled, feed him and try to keep him safe and happy. I know its not that simple, but boy do I feel like a failure right now. Hoping things will at least be back to baseline tomorrow. ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/59978/shock-of-my-life-x2,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-02-20 18:33:21,695024,760.0

1708,647b5a6f091b6ef899d1db11,60000,,Bouncing back and forth with abilities,"My FIL as many of you know had hip surgery in January and it has taken a good month for him to be off the many meds to even start to gauge what he can and can’t do. Some things he seems better than pre-surgery, and others worse. What is new for us is that we seem to be bouncing back and forth between his abilities. Before when he lived here, it was a steady decline. He would lose an ability more and more until it was gone. Here is what we see: Some days he will say less than 5 words, while others he will speak sentences, and ask where things are, and clearly express what is bothering him. He has not done that since October at least. Some days his eyes completely glaze over and he is staring into space, no interaction with the world or people around him. Others he is very alert, makes eye contact, pets the dog, smiles at jokes and makes sarcastic comments periodically  Some nights he sleeps well, others he is experiencing some kind of delirium  Some days he can express a need to go to the bathroom and actually uses the toilet, others he goes in his depends. Some days he gets up and walks at a normal pace (with assistance), others he cannot stand, he is a “dead weight”. On his best days he pulls away from me wanting to do everything himself - which is scary - we have both ended up on the floor (not hard falls, more like easing him down) Some days he can brush his teeth, and hold a spoon, drink from a cup, or at least feed himself finger foods. Others, he will not eat unless the food is placed him his mouth repeatedly, and loses interest in food quickly. On more “clear” days he is a lot more cantankerous and stubborn, but the trade off is worth it Both ways, he sleeps, a lot. Probably 60%- 70% of his day I know we are in stage 7 regardless. But on bad days, it feels like this is the beginning of the end, he is that unresponsive. On good days it feels like he could live for years. It is hard to gauge where he is at. This is new for us, as decline was more steady. We have found no trigger to explain why one day is better or worse. No indication of pain, UTI, amount of sleep, or diet changes… And it is back and forth day to day and sometimes within one day. Is this just part of the last stage?

They are loosing the ability to assemble a sandwich or reheat food and sometimes forgetting to eat.  They have lost most of their ability to use electronics except calling and texting on cell phone. They are bathing only occasionally if reminded.  They are not exit seeking but have become disoriented walking in their neighborhood. A few weeks back they cut themselves bad enough to require care but not stitches while trying to trim toenails.  (They never did trim the nails). Their foot bleed all day in their shoe until I saw a wince of pain. They had no idea the wound should have been washed, bandaged etc  after I cleaned it up they wanted to put he bloody sock back on   They are still in great physical health and have a very social demeanor.  Why do I feel so bad for thinking they need assisted living?  I worry we are one bad accident away form tragedy.

1711,647b5a7d091b6ef899d1dbc4,60011,,How to answer why am I here (in MC facility)? Is it ever appropriate to tell the truth?,"My dad and I recently moved my 68-year old mother into a memory care facility.  Today is her two-week anniversary there, and it's already a struggle.  She gets stuck in a ""loop"" asking questions: why do I have to be here?  When can I go home?  I didn't do anything wrong, why am I wearing an ankle bracelet?  Why are you lying to me?  What's really going on?  Why can't I go home?  Why have you taken my life away?  I felt better than I ever have before I came here.  I'm going to go kill myself! The fiblet we are maintaining is that she's there temporarily.  We don't know how long, though, we have to wait for the doctor to OK release.  But that's not enough.  She gets so upset, repeating the questions over and over, getting increasingly agitated all the while.  It eventually turns really nasty towards my dad, who my mom blames for taking away her life, for lying to her, for locking her up where she doesn't belong.  This just breaks my dad's heart; they were high school sweethearts with a wonderful marriage; he would literally die before doing anything that might cause her the slightest pain. It's these outbursts of agitation that led her to the MC facility.  They were happening nearly every night (around 2-3am), and took hours and visits from other family members to talk her down.  It just wasn't possible for my dad to take care of her. My dad and I participated in our first caregiver's support group meeting (virtually, via Zoom).  Such wonderful, nice people.  But I was almost jealous, so many of the participants had LOs with dementia, but without the aggression and depression that my mom has.  LOs who knew and accepted their dementia, took their meds, and cooperated with their caretakers.  If it weren't for these episodes of psychosis, I think my mom could continue to live at home, and at least have some semblance of her old life.  And, though she doesn't have any short-term memory, she still has her wit: it only takes a quick look around in the MC facility to see that she's different than everyone else.  She's definitely the youngest one there (probably by a decade), and at least two thirds are in a wheelchair or use a walker, where she's in great physical health. I live about three hours away, so can't regularly visit, but I saw her this weekend.  I witnessed one of these episodes for the first time - before, I think she was always able to reign it in while I was around.  She was just saying such awful things to my dad.  I tried to talk to her, wanting so badly to tell her the truth.  But I've read so many times, the truth will likely only upset her.  I danced around it as best I could: ""Mom, you know, you were a scientist, you worked in a hospital lab all your life: sometimes you have to make decisions about health care that are unpleasant, but necessary.  That's where we are.  I know in my heart, and fully believe that dad is only doing what he has to.  It's not what any of us want, but it's what we have to do.  And we just have to wait and see what the doctor says about leaving here.""  That maybe helped ever-so-slightly, and it wasn't until her sister showed up and also helped talk her down, that she finally relaxed a bit. As if dementia wasn't bad enough, it just saddens me so much, that she has this intractable depression/aggression/agitation going along with it.  It's hard not to look at her situation and conclude that she's in a living hell.  How do we put on a smile and try to be chipper and upbeat and make her happy, when we know it's only going to get worse?  And, given her age and physical health, we could be in for a very long ride? I feel I've consistently read, here and other places, telling a PWD that she has dementia will almost certainly make things worse(*).  But is that always true?  I also know that every case is different; there are similarities only in the very broadest sense.  So has anyone ever told their LO about their dementia and had it improve things?  I can't help but feel my mom's case is already a bit of an outlier.

She expressed to me she fears that Mom, my LO with AD living in a SNF since May 2021, “…is alone more than she should be.” Also, recently, one of Mom’s younger brothers said he would not be returning to the SNF because “…it smells like a nursing home,” and that I should be ashamed for putting her there.  It’s like, where were y’all when Mom and I needed you?!?  To practice emotional intelligence and empathy is exhausting. As her only son and attorney-in-fact, I’m either criticized or praised, and both are weird. It’s either “You need to [insert uninformed, unsolicited advice],” or “You are such a good son. You’ve done all you could. Now, do what you want to do. You are young. Don’t worry about her.” I don’t/didn’t take care of her because I want to be a “good son,” and I didn’t abandon her by placing her in a SNF when I (the only person caring for her) could not logistically take care of her anymore.  I think the most frustrating thing is that I can’t just…be.

1714,647b5a88091b6ef899d1dc4f,55971,,Anticipatory Grief and Multilayered Guilt: What Do I Do?!?,"*NOTICE: This is a long read. Thank you in advance for being willing to take time to read all of this.* I am a 31-year-old only child of a 78-year-old mother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018 but showed contributory signs of the disease in 2015. I am a part-time college instructor who has chosen to move back home with my mom to take care of her full-time. I have been her primary caregiver and attorney-in-fact since 2019. According to the seven-stage model, Mom is solidly between stages 6 and 7.  Being an Alzheimer’s caregiver is such a dynamic experience, isn’t it? With all the ups and downs, there never seems to be any kind of stability, even when the progression of the disease temporarily plateaus. You automatically take on the roles of parent, personal accountant, legal advocate, confidant, nutritionist, home aide, teacher, friend, enemy, and counselor. You often have to forgo processing your thoughts and feelings because you prioritize your affected loved one’s thoughts and feelings as well as those of unaffected relatives and friends (by affected and unaffected, I mean “diagnosed” and “not diagnosed,” respectively). You deal with relatives’ unsolicited, uninformed opinions as they talk negatively about you behind your back yet don’t make any efforts to help and objectively have zero clue of the gravity of the situation because they never visit or directly observe day-to-day activities. At the same time, you deal with the same individuals’ anticipatory grief because the reality is they also have some sort of meaningful relationship to the affected loved one. I’m at my wit’s end. I’m tired, angry, sad, disappointed, drained, and hopeless. It’s weird to be between the stages of grieving the First Death, which is death to pre-decline life, and anticipatingly grieving the Second Death, the actual physical passing. It’s frustrating to do every single thing I possibly can to make sure Mom’s well-being is in tact with integrity, but those who only see a fraction of a fraction of what Mom and I daily endure continue to be impossibly negative and ignorant. I’m angry that the long-term care system in the United States seems to be designed to take every single thing from you and the affected loved one, including either selling all assets pre-facility or risking an asset seizure post-facility/post-Second Death. I’ve talked to several senior care specialists, elder law and estate law attorneys, social workers, her family medicine practitioner, neurologist, prescribing psychiatric nurse, and her mental health counselor, and the conclusion is that time is not on our side in figuring out how to pay for long-term care without sacrificing an arm and a leg for Medicare and Medicaid to contribute.  The simplest of tasks, such as raising her arm, is even a cognitively difficult request. She sleeps a lot. She no longer explicitly expresses hunger, thirst, emotions, or pain. Her motor skills are slowly but surely declining. She doesn’t know what to do with a phone or remote control or book anymore. She doesn’t know any identifying info about me or herself (I’m often her father or little brother but never her son). I’m struggling to keep my professional life organized and healthy and my personal life balanced.  I feel so, so alone with limited solutions. The facts are I’m not a speech therapist, nurse, OT, or PT, and I cannot give her the 24-hour care she desperately needs. However, because of money, we just don’t have any other choice right but for her to stay home and for me to stay with her. Whether I choose to sell her paid-for home that’s on family land in order to qualify her for Medicaid or choose to keep her at home, I will always feel guilty. There’s always a give-and-take with these kinds of situations. That’s part of the reason that I feel weird when someone else says, “You are such a good son. She’s lucky/blessed to have you.” I understand and appreciate their sentiments, but I’m just doing what needs to be done, and I simply love and want the best for her.  With all of that said, do you have any insight regarding how to deal with this kind of solitude?",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/55971/anticipatory-grief-and-multilayered-guilt-what-do-i-do,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-03-10 08:00:14,765464,15.0

We are working on tapering him off lithium, lexapro, and donzepil, and the hospital doctor agreed this is the best hope for his physical recovery. He is too much of a zombie otherwise. We plan to leave him on memantine for now. The reason he is on these drugs is that he was pushing/hitting other residents last fall so they had to medicate him. As he is now bedridden at our house, he is no danger to anyone. We will keep evaluating, talk to  doc and make changes if he needs to add any med back if needed. Good news is he is more alert and communicative and cooperative during the day. He is more awake to eat and be moved around and is moving himself more around the bed. Today, I played his favorite music and he was singing along. He is eating great, vitals, are good, toileting is good. He is able to stand and be moved to a chair. His hands have been shaking uncontrollably but I believe that is getting somewhat better. Today he was able to hold his cup and drink. But nighttime, he is having major nightmares or anxiety. Any tips for that? I thought it was pain, but when we ask he says no. He is mostly repeating words like “help help help” or conversations, repeated cuss words... sometimes he is doing that while he pees (in the daytime too). He *really* hates peeing in a pull up, being changed, and fusses every time.  He is taking half dose of lithium and lexapro at night with the idea to wean off. Everything else is morning. I have wondered if they are causing his nightmares? Before the facility, we controlled his sundowning with melatonin but I can’t start back on that until he’s off the other.

1718,647b5ae7091b6ef899d1e106,60630,,First Post - Drowning,"I have been reading for some time, and am very grateful for the thoughts and ideas I've been able to benefit from to date. I'm not sure why I was driven to post, and I'm not sure what I'm hoping for, but I am coming up empty on ideas. Apologies, this is a long story, and I'm a little too strung out to revise appropriately. The TLDR is that my mother has been declining, but had a sudden significant change after some temporary health issues, and is now in an assisted living facility, not cooperating, not nearly functional enough for assisted living, and I don't know what to do. My mother is 70 and has dementia. There were signs before my father's death 5.5 years ago, but the diagnosis was slow in coming because the symptoms were difficult to definitively distinguish from depression after he died. Since I have talked to her on the phone daily for many years, I started raising the flag early, and was waving it in earnest three years ago, but wasn't able to get traction either with her or other family members. She eventually was the one who requested the appointment with a neurologist. I know very little about the diagnosis, as I live remotely in Illinois, while she lives in Ohio; my brother, who lives locally to her, was the one who was invited to her doctor's appointments, and wouldn't press for details. This does not seem like the Alzheimer's in the movies and on TV - she didn't lose recent memories while retaining old ones. She had trouble with words/meanings early on, and seemed to lose memories pretty evenly from her whole life, while confabulating lots of stories in the meantime. She still recognizes my brother and my family and I, but not friends (who have mostly ditched her), pictures of out-of-state family she hasn't seen often, or even pictures of my father.  My brother and I have worked different parts of the challenge. He continued to take her out for meals regularly, took over her finances, and took her car keys in November 2020 at the recommendation of the neurologist. From remotely, since the onset of the pandemic, I purchased all her groceries and sent meals, signed her up for Meals on Wheels, sent activities and clothing and any needs or wants, and continued to engage with her daily to let my brother know about emergent issues that couldn't be addressed from Illinois. He struggles to do anything hands-on, and she wants to be near him/wants nothing to do with coming to live near me. Things came to a head last fall (October 2021, she kicked out the part time caregiver we had arranged, and her house cleaner reported some very concerning things), and I left my family in Illinois to move in with her for two months to work remotely and take care of her and to arrange daily, all-day caregiving that she would accept. Meanwhile, due to her anosognosia, we had to petition for guardianship, as she could not be convinced to agree with decisions in her interest, and we had missed our window for PoA (she was declared incompetent by her neurologist). The guardianship was awarded on Valentine's Day; my brother, since he lives in the same state as her, is full guardian, and I am co-guardian of the person.  We made a reservation for her at an Assisted Living/Memory Care facility that I really liked in Ohio, but their assessment from early March suggested she should try in Assisted Living rather than Memory Care. I was surprised, but not being an expert, I was willing to trust them. I had been planning out and purchasing her furnishings for the AL apartment when the big nosedive hit. One gap I left when I moved home at the end of December was in treating wounds that were recurring on her lower legs. I had requested her PCP refer her for home nursing wound care after I went back to Illinois (I had been treating them when they emerged), but he refused, recommending instead that she go to a local wound care center. That ended up being insufficient (one appointment every two months?!?!), and she landed in the hospital with cellulitis that went septic on March 13th. At that time, she seemed to lose the ability to walk and became completely incontinent. She went from the hospital to a rehab facility where she participated in PT for a couple of days, but then ended up with an upper GI bleed--back to the hospital. After that resolved, she went back to the rehab facility, but would no longer participate in PT. I had given them lots of suggestions as to how to get her to engage (take cell phone out of her hand, turn off TV, turn on music, try to determine if she say ""ouch,"" whether she actually has pain, or if she is just confused and not liking what's happening, etc.). They didn't seem to appreciate the scale of memory loss and confusion they were dealing with - she still SOUNDS normal in her voice and conversational cadence, and she has normal facial expressions - and they insisted that they couldn't force her to try. They suggested I should encourage her to participate. Well, I could encourage until the cows came home, but if I wasn't not there at the time of the PT, she wouldn't remember. I went out for a week in March while she was in the first hospital, in rehab briefly, and in the second hospital. I was working remotely during the day, visiting her in the evenings, and working the night shift at the AL putting together furniture and such. I had planned to go back out and finish assembling her AL apartment over Easter weekend, plus be able to visit her for Easter. The sudden announcement on Wednesday afternoon that insurance was cutting her off from rehab changed the plans into emergency mode. I appealed the decision to try to get a little more time for her to try (I had arranged to be there Saturday morning for her PT session), but the appeal was denied, so I drove out overnight Thursday to try to get things ready. While I know full well that dementia is progressive, I really didn't expect for my ambulatory mother to become bedbound and incontinent so suddenly. If this is a UTI, I don't know how we can fix it after the courses of antibiotics she went through for the sepsis/cellulitis. The adorable apartment I designed for her seems very ill-suited now--even the cute bed I bought and made up for her will end up getting ditched for a hospital bed. She won't even sit up, even though she totally can (we convinced her to try sitting at the edge of the bed on Saturday with my husband and I supporting her, encouraging her, reassuring her - and she did it fine despite a lot of complaining about anything she could throw out). She is still strong, just confused or for some reason putting her foot down on this and every other issue - she's not going to do any. thing. else. I couldn't convince her to let me help change her out of her spinach-stained shirt (from eating while lying down) from Saturday on Easter. She could not have cared less about the Easter basket with gifts I brought her, and said very hurtful things to me. She is CONSTANTLY wanting to eat, even when she just ate and said she was done and to take the plates away, but she REFUSES to sit up - even the nurse said she will choke if we let her eat while lying in bed. The Assisted Living staff just called my brother to ask for advice - she won't let them change her soiled depends. I'm beside myself - this is untenable. We can't allow her to refuse basic care, can we? This does not seem like someone suited for Assisted Living. If she's so resistant to everything, I don't know if she would even be suited for Memory Care (not that there is space in Memory Care at her current facility right now - I'm afraid they are going to kick her out, too). I don't know what the other options would be. Do we need to sedate her so they can change her? Would a skilled nursing facility be better? Health-wise, she seems to be fine - eating, drinking, strong. She's young, and I don't get the impression that this is the end stage of her life (although I don't have the experience to know, I guess). Is this something that medication adjustment may help? Is that the realm of a geriatric psychiatrist? She has told my brother she's pretty sure she'd be able to walk fine if he'd just take her back to her house--but no proposal on how she will get to his car. Meanwhile, I'm just so, so, so sad. I'm heartbroken. I'm anxious all the time to the point where I feel like I can't breathe. I've been in therapy for over a year, largely to address my grief and terror over my mother's situation; it doesn't seem to help at all. My children, who came out to visit Grandma and to not be away from me on Easter, are devastated by what they saw. It feels so much like she is gone, but she's still here. I can't figure out how to help her. She's de facto making decisions against her own interests with her behavior, and she shouldn't be making decisions at all. I can't help feeling like I've failed her, and failed my father who asked me to take care of her.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/60630/first-post-drowning,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-04-19 01:02:47,788015,5.0

I cannot take care of her any longer, and I will not have her move in with me. What are options that you guys know of for her?

She was in memory care, generally agitation-prone and hyper ambulatory, capable of recognizing family but mostly speaking in word salads. She’d lost a lot of weight from just not showing interest in or keeping focus on food. A femur fracture from a fall while on Xanax was deemed healable w/o surgery, but has been mostly sedated in hospital (morphine-> tramadol->oxy + Ativan/Xanax+ Seroquel) largely to keep her in bed. Almost no eating and drinking for several days bc she was not conscious enough. After requesting lighter meds and very little display of pain, she’ll take food if coaxed and occasionally takes pleasure in it. Since she could not go to rehab bc she needed 24hr monitoring and her memory care won’t take her back if she can’t walk, the doctor recommended a hospice home. Upon arrival at hospice she has been on morphine and unable to open her eyes and certainly not able to eat. They say it’s for pain and I think to keep her from getting out of bed, but it is now a matter of time before she is gone from lack of water/food, and we are encouraged to be accepting of that. I just have a bad feeling knowing we’re consciously choosing to hasten her death by allowing her to stay sedated and unable to eat. Agitation is still an issue, but I wish mitigating it didn’t require such heavy sedation. Has anyone experienced a situation like this or does anyone have any thoughts to share? Is this common?

At the time the nurse said she wasn't ready/didn't qualify. Over the last two-three weeks she has had some pain and swelling in her knee which she has complained of, as well as her back (she has spinal stenosis, so the back is an ongoing problem). Try as we might, we've been able to help the knee pain, but it has remained swollen and sometimes he lower leg and foot are also swollen. In the past three weeks, she had more confusion and has nearly quit walking (she has walked with a walker for several years now) and the little bit that she does walk, she has great difficulty and has been dragging her non-swollen leg. Over the past couple of months she has been eating less and less, and typically only wants oatmeal, bananas and will occasionally eat some scrambled eggs and pudding. She complains a lot of everything tasting bitter. Luckily, little to no issues with swallowing so far. The last two or three days she has (kindly) asked our caregiver (whom she adores) to go home early and says she's tired and wants to go back to bed - where she is spending more and more time. I feel like we're reaching the failure to thrive stage, but from the explanation of the last hospice nurse, it almost seems like she needs to be near death to qualify.  We live in a large metro area so I do have other options for hospice groups.   I have a doctor's appointment scheduled in a little over two weeks for her, but she is incredibly hard to get out of the house now.  Would it be worthwhile for me to go ahead and have another hospice evaluation?  It is so hard to tell with this disease if we are in a major decline or if one day she will bounce back a bit. Thanks in advance, I greatly appreciate any advice you all want to share. ~ Melanie P.S. I would say that she was already in mid-stage 6, and she does not have a UTI as she takes a daily dose of an antibiotic to keep lymphedema at bay (residual issue from breast cancer suffered a few years ago).

I was told stage 4 lasts about 2 years and since she may have had a stroke, to get ready for possible sudden changes.  She's very resistant to medical care, was able to hide her problems quite well so I have no idea when stage 4 started.  Her BMI is low, just under 19, I think. She has taken Depakote for about 2 months.  It was prescribed by a housecall physician whose practice specializes in older patients, many with dementia. It was suggested as a way to reduce anxiety.  It seemed to do that, which also helped with her appetite.  It has also helped her sleep, which has helped with the pain, which is intermittent, sudden and fleeting. She started this med during a respite/trial AL stay.   The first month was the smallest dose, at night. Added a morning dose at the 1 month mark. The med improved her sleep and reduced her anxiety. The first week on the high dose, she was enjoyed dining with other people, even a little chatting. The second week on the higher dose was a very good week. She allowed some personal care ( a haircut!, a ""bath"" with wipes - the first since late August.)  The next 2 weeks saw a decline in her ability to stand, even more unsteadiness in her walking, and her first failure to recognize me, her daughter.  That was a very brief episode, and she knew it was happening almost at once.    She's also had some very clear, fluent conversations when she seems calm and relaxed. She's had some childlike pleasure in ice cream; notable since she doesn't generally eat sweets.   Plans to move her back to AL (or MC?) are underway; her home does not have a full bath on the first floor.  In general, I would say that her progression has seemed faster than average from the start of my active involvement.  She doesn't line up well with what I read in the books, but does line up with the posts here that use the phrase ""rapid progression."" Frankly, I'm not sure I will finish reading the 36 hours book in time!  I had marked my calendar to check on this med at the 30 day mark.  Is that about right? I think I read it somewhere, but now I don't remember where.   It is my job to ask the questions. I think what I am seeing is progression, but could it be overmedication? What would indicate overmedication?   I need to know because we are also considering trialing a second med as the neuropathy type pains are not getting any better and are a really big quality of life issue.  ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/60413/assessing-over-medication-30-days,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-03-29 08:32:15,789898,12.0

I sat on my bed and sketched an awesome picture of Pennywise the clown from the newer version of IT.  I mean, I know mom and I are not close and we never had a tight relationship, and I should not have taken this personally, but she said she hated me.  Growing up, she pretty much ignored me. I was provided for, but not emotionally. She was very detached to me. She did not tell me she loved me until I was 23. When I was 14, we were staying with my horrible oldest sister and there was a lot going on. She was mad at everyone for causing all this drama. I got snarky with her as most 14 year old kids do with their parents, and she called me a bitch. Basically mom was passive/aggressive...I got the aggressive. So I'm sitting in my room, sketching my awesome Pennywise picture, texting my POA sis and my Florida sis. POA sis said she would try talking to mom again.  By then mom was crying. POA sis was able to calm her down and explain to her that this was about her safety. She can't see that well, she can't hear, she was getting worse, she is always in pain, her blood pressure was difficult to manage which could lead to a stroke, she is a fall risk and she needed to be somewhere that could provide 24 hr monitoring. Mom came in to my room crying and apologized. She said she was angry and she did not mean to say that. I reiterated what I tried to tell her earlier. I also said that we had time. Because I was not going to just dump her anywhere. She would get to choose a place.  So we're okay now but going forward, Things are about to get very emotional for her...probably for me too.

1734,647b5ba2091b6ef899d1ea4a,60821,,Dad requires surgery broken hip.. many decisions to be made,"I was to write to you all a few days ago to help me make a decision in regards to dads care. He was back in his home back in March with hospice, 3 Medicaid workers, and one daughter. Came April I asked hospice to take him off because they were having trouble waking him. Hospice suspected meds being administered too close. Once in the emergency room, they diagnosed him as having acute dehydration, pneumonia, low sodium, DKA, and sepsis syndrome. It was a kick in the gut because I feel the dehydration and DKA were human errors. Things that could be controlled to some extent because dad was good about his intake. So after the hospital stay, I decided to give our small nursing home a try for skilled care. First, I tried to work with them on a plan for catheter removal because of dad’s history of not wanting anything attached to him and pulling them out or off. They just outright said no until his prostate doctor wrote an order. Then the sharing lunch in the dining area I guess changed due to covid. Then I found him this week with same clothes on from the weekend. Went to change him and all clothes are gone and everyone is giving me the run around. Another day later, I get a call that dad had slipped out the bed but was not hurt. I didn’t visit until a day later. I saw dad was indeed hurt and breathing horribly. The head nurse was dismissive of my concerns. The next day dad was sent to the ER about his breathing. The nurse there asked why he doesn’t want anyone to move his leg and come to find out his hip is broken.  Not only am I to make one decision but I have two. I was already considering removing him from this nursing home and maybe sending him back to the larger one that I didn’t care for either based on a trial. But now this. Without surgery, no quality of life due to not having mobility and pain issues according to surgeon. If he qualify for the surgery and makes it, what then? Is it back to one of the crappy nursing homes or the crap shop at his home? If they can’t do the surgery, do I send him back to one of those places or send him back home? If I do the home option, do I go hospice route or regular home health route and get back on the payroll as part of the care team? I did it for seven years but stopped due to family drama.  The only thing about hospice in our area is they don’t offer palliative. I have a few concerns about hospice but don’t know if it is the norm. Don’t get me wrong they’re great. However, one time dad had heavy bleeding in his urine and hospice didn’t want to test for uti.  They automatically said it was his prostate cancer. After it got heavier, we took him off and took him in. It was not his cancer. Moving toward today with a new hospice company. Dad started off with a bad cough, hospice gave antibiotics. After the cough and congestion still was not clearing up, we requested an x-ray and they said they would do, but all they kept doing was giving another round of same antibiotics.

1735,647b5ba7091b6ef899d1ea90,60927,,Need advice(24),"I HAD to place my mother in assisted living early last December - her needs are now more than I can take on, I have others that I am responsible for and she needs 24/7 care - besides the issue of having to lift her with my bad back (she is incontinent and can't walk - originally due to a severly bad knee and hip, now I wonder if later stage dementia is also and issue with her ability to walk).   The facility is not the best, but due to her elopement issues transferring her right now is impossible. That said, she never wanted to go to assisted living, so her accepting her placement - even in the altered state that dementia puts them in - is not going to happen. She's calm enough now (due to increased medications), but still says that she is going home tomorrow and things like that. (I do not *think* the increased meds are an issue, she’s been on them for several months - but without them she becomes very aggressive.) She is on medicaid and hospice. She has heart issues (pacemaker, chronic afib), kidney issues (stage 3b - last time tested), and the afore mentioned leg issues (long term issue for her). She recently had a UTI, they've medicated her for the UTI and it is better - and *may be* gone! They say that her urine looks better. Hospice doesn't pay for testing for UTIs, so we are waiting to see if she really is better. The medication they gave her is strong and they believed it should do the job.  Problem is that, even before she had the UTI I had noticed an increase in her dementia progression. She now slumps, and often speaks in 'word salad' - I can tell she is trying to tell us a story, but nothing she says makes any sense. If I say ""I love you"" she immediately says ""I love you too"" clear as a bell. I asked her how she feels, she says I feel fine - so apparently no pain issues.  Our hospice nurse says she is at the beginning of stage 7 - she called it 7a. She said that some progress quickly at this stage, others more slowly. She also said that she’s noticed shortness of breath, which is most likely a heart issue. But the if we want to be more progressive with her care, she'll need to go off of hospice. I KNOW that she would not want us to prolong her life, if she truly has no quality of life. All we would be doing is prolonging her mental suffering, while trying to improve her body’s functionality (for her being in a wheelchair is hard enough - she has always been a 'go get her' type person).  Problem is that it is so hard to know what direction to go. Does she still have ‘life’ to live? I mean, how do we know what ‘will to live’ she still has? I would not want to lessen one minute of the life she wants to live! She has a DNR, that she signed while still aware - I know she does NOT want a life that has no quality - but how do we know when it is time to let nature take its course? I do not think she is going to pass soon, so do we treat her physical needs, only to extend her life for the later stages of this terrible disease? One of my other sibling is coming for a visit in a few weeks. If things are not better, we will need to decide whether we want to be more aggressive with our mother's physical care needs (I have two other sibling that will help with that decision - but they will have to do so long distance).  Do any of you have any suggestions or experiences with being at this point of this terrible disease? What are the pros and cons of taking her off of hospice? Honestly the facility she is at is not all that good. Hospice has been our saving grace for her treatment, I've always trusted them - don't trust the facility to take over her care 100%, but I CAN'T bring her home and neither can any of my other sibling.

She tells me how lonely she is all the time and how much she misses me and that I am the only person she cares to even see.  She barely speaks to my father, and could not care less if my husband, her sister or nieces come to visit.   But, beyond that, she is terribly depressed and feels isolated yet will not go anywhere.  I understand that fear of going out is part of the decease, plus she has neuropathy and has terrible balance.  She is so down.    To make the situation more depressing, in the last 2 years she has turned to wine to ""calm""  herself, as she says.  The Dr. said that many people do this, or Benedril, or Tylenol PM to escape what they know is happening to them.    If she does not get wine, she is unbearable to be around.  Yelling, screaming and then sulking.   The next day, she has no recollections of her behavior, of course.  The Dr. said as long as she is safe, to just give her some wine even thought it's not a great idea.  But once she has had one, or two, she will search the house for more all while screaming and yelling. Trying to keep her seated is impossible.  She has had falls.  I know it's because of the wine, but she does not remember the wine; only that she fell and is in pain.  She always says, ""I only had one"", but we know better.   She was never never a drinker!! My dad is beside himself and my heart breaks for him.  I call every day, often, and I try to distract her and keep things light but its becoming increasing more difficult.   I am afraid she is going to fall, break an hip, and then that will be a slide she does not come back from.    As for a plan?  He has saved about $50k for a home health aid when the time comes. He will not even consider the possibility that she might need to be placed somewhere.  And if he did, there goes the house they both love so much.  I know $50k will not be enough, but I cannot talk to him about financial things as he is from that generation.  ""Not something my daughter needs to be concerned with"".  No plan was made earlier by either of them to plan for the potential of long-term care.

1737,647b5bc8091b6ef899d1ec30,59120,,Paging Birdie...Please Update Us,"I was saddened to read your now dated post. Hoping you will advise us on your current situation. You didn't explain why mom is not allowing Hospice. Is she refusing to even talk with them? Their nurse and/or social worker might just be able to explain to her what is in store for you as a family, and how they can help (not just dad but all of you). Is your caregiver trained in end stage care? Hospice can also advise you on your dad's current status and how best to care for him. If not actively dying, he likely is transitioning. They begin withdrawing from their surroundings, growing disinterested in contact, and later, mottled skin, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, glazed eyes, cold extremities, discolored toes, etc. are signs the body is shutting down.  You mentioned his gurgling during feeding, and being terrified that he will choke (aspirate). My DW has been there for months now. Hospice can also advise you on the choices you must make at this point. FYI, during a recent respite stay at DW's hospice facility, they refused to feed her, so I went in daily to do so. I suppose their telling me how dangerous that is would be stopping just short of asking me not to. During active dying, they reach a point where they no longer need or can process food. But my personal feeling is that stopping before that point is starving them. I wouldn't advise that unless you have Hospice care on board to keep him comfortable and pain free. Aspiration induced pnemonia is a common cause of death, secondary to the underlying dementia, IMO, preferable to starving, but better to keep him home with Hospice care than sending him to the hospital.

1738,647b5bd3091b6ef899d1ecb7,58990,,Here to vent. I feel inadequate.,"Hi everyone, I've posted once before and feel the need to vent again.  Mom is 76 and in addition to being stage 4ish Alzheimer's and Vascular Dementia, she has pancreatic cancer and is on home hospice. She has been living with my husband and me since March this year. I am her primary caregiver. The hospice nurse and I discovered yesterday that mom has a stage 2 bedsore on each butt cheek (the intragluteal region). Mirror image bedsores, basically. She's been telling me for a couple weeks that her butthole hurts. She has been constipated and is taking morphine for cancer pain, so a hemorrhoid is what we thought was giving her pain. Opioid induced constipation is very common and awful to deal with if it gets bad. Mom's extremely modest and wouldn't agree to us looking at it and we didn't push hard to see it, which was a mistake.  I gave her tucks pads and got hemorrhoid cream for her supposed hemorrhoid. Still she had pain when she sat a certain way.  She is still fully mobile and walks around the house daily and sits at the table to eat, etc. She gets up and walks to the bathroom when she needs to. She wants to have as much independence while living with us as possible. I think the cause of the bedsores was from our cat who adores my mom and tries to lay on her lap as often as possible. What cat lover would argue with that? But then mom would sit in the same position for a long time so she wouldn't disturb the cat. Plus the cat is chonky and weighs probably another 15 pounds.  So mom didn't understand that the pain from the bedsores was not from her butthole, it is from bedsores. Still doesn't really understand and forgets immediately. I drew a diagram and taped it to the wall by her toilet paper roll to remind her. I know she will end up needing with them and making them harder to heal. Now her big fear is worse. Since we didn't catch the bed sores sooner, she has to drop her drawers for me to put cream on them 2-3 times per day in the hopes they will heal.  I'm having trouble finding a position for her to lay in that will take the pressure off the sores that she will continue to lay in. (She sleeps in a recliner because of arthritis.) She usually goes back to sit-lying in the way that gave her the sores to begin with. It's also a battle to try to get her to bathe. She is weak and tired from the cancer already, but she doesn't want me to bring in a home health aide from hospice or elsewhere. She'll backpeddle and say she wants me to help her. But when the time comes, she's too tired and doesn't want it and refuses. I believe her.  Cancer causes exhausting fatigue and pain. But she has to be cleaned. Her skin is fragile and I'm more worried now about skin breakdowns elsewhere. She's just asking for an infection. I think it's probably time to have hospice deliver the rental hospital bed so she could at least get bed baths in it from an aide if nothing else. But she probably won't stay in it. I am leaning toward just making her do things she doesn't want and hoping she forgets about it later. But it's tricky because her mind can still latch on to certain memories and exaggerate them.  I'm looking at the title of this post and thinking ""no one could feel completely adequate in this position.""

After a frustrating experience with a nursing home, we have recently moved mom back to her home of more than 50 years, where she lives on the first floor and is cared for by a live-in CNA. I live nearby and  visits two or three times per week to bring her necessities and to talk with her. She can still hold conversations and talk about current events and her memories, although she sometimes can't grasp concepts, and, on her bad days, loses track of where or when she is and who it is she is talking with. Both at the nursing home and now with the private caregiver, mom has a behavior that makes it very hard to care for her. Frequently, when she is touched in order to change her diaper, reposition her, or provide other needed care, she will shout that ""it hurts! it hurts!"" (or just ""ow! ow!"" or similar) and seek to push away or even to strike (ineffectually) the person trying to assist her.  We don't believe that she is in actual pain. The complaints only arise when she is handled, not when she is unmolested. Doctors and nurses have looked for things that might be hurting her when she is handled and found nothing. And the complaints often start with the first gentle touch, not later, when mom's body is actually being moved or manipulated. My best, non-expert, guess is that this is simply the best protest that she can muster, given her current condition, against the indignity of what is happening to her. And, honestly, I think that the fact that her caregivers are not white is a factor. Mom has been a liberal supporter of civil rights for her entire adult life, but she was born in 1932 and raised in the U.S. South as the privileged daughter of a family that traces its lineage back to the early days of the state, surrounded by African American servants and deeply ingrained caste system.

I'm writing now because I'm so anxious about my 77-year-old mom's imminent passing at home from dementia and my dad's reluctance/refusal to get outside help, as in palliative care, hospice, etc. He has been caring for her at home for the past 13 years, refusing help from anyone except me and not seeking medical care. He is the epitome of the stubborn, independent, proud, private individualist. My husband was diagnosed, also with Alzheimer's, in 2017 at age 57, so we moved near my parents, enabling me to help care for my mom while also caring for my husband. Mom is now sleeping much of the time, with little to no cognition. Several times, she's stopped eating and drinking for a day and had seizure-like episodes, making us think it was the end, only to rally and get back to ""normal.""  I have asked my dad repeatedly to set up at-home hospice or some sort of palliative care so that we will be able to give my mom pain medication if she is in pain when she does pass. He keeps putting it off and trying to placate me by saying he'll do it next week, etc., and then he doesn't do it. I know that he's hoping she'll pass peacefully in her sleep and he won't have to deal with having a stranger in their home telling him what he should do. He doesn't think she will be in pain when she finally goes.  Meanwhile, I've read all I can about the dying process so at least I'll know something about what's going on and how to help. But I can't prescribe morphine. Will paramedics administer pain meds if I end up having to call an ambulance (against my dad's wishes) if she's struggling at the end? I really don't know how likely it is that she will pass peacefully without the need for medication. I'm going to insist that he call the doctor on Monday and if he doesn't, call someone in palliative care to see what my options are. I'm extra anxious now because my mom hardly ate anything yesterday.  If anyone has some advice for me based on your experience, I would really appreciate hearing it.

1747,647b5c42091b6ef899d1f234,59376,,Psych is requesting I take my mother home.," Hi,  So currently my mother is in a geriatric psych facility much to my dismay, nevertheless my hand was forced since her current care team refuses to work with me again finding a medication and dosage that is safe and effective. Her current care team felt she was not at the stage where higher dosages were warranted for her behaviors cause they are manageable with proper inventions. I am just not willing to give up the time required to do so. She has not been in the facility for a long just a couple of days and I am getting calls to take her home. She refuses to eat, refuses to get up to go to the bathroom, her paranoia and delusions have become far worse. I short she is losing all the functionality she had before, which is not new. I did example to them that my mother was in a geriatric psych facility before and my father took her home at the facilities request cause she was getting worse and not better from her baseline and they felt she was not a good fit. My old man had a heart of gold and did not want to see her suffer so he took her home. When he took her home she was back to her baseline. More or less this new facility has told me the same thing, that they are in agreement with her current care team that chemical therapies are not what she needs at this moment, and they do not feel her quality of life would be enhanced by doing so, it appears you see are most likely doing this for your own convenience and not the well-being of your mother.   I thought I could handle anything they threw at me, I already knew what I was doing was not in her best interest, but I am in this ride alone no family wants to help for understandable reasons, my wife checked out also for understandable reasons. For the longest it was my father and I that rotated the responsibilities which made it bearable. My mother by her nature is a manipulative person that was her core personality trait before all of this. So I am hard pressed cause I spoke with my wife and she is most likely right that my mom is playing me. Though the stress of knowing she is suffering is unbearable.  I know it is harsh but turned off my phone, but then my family has been bothering my wife trying to get into contact with me it appears my mother gave them my aunts number. Now my wife is getting dragged into this mess cause I am trying to find a treatment plan that will help manage my mothers behavior so I can find placement for her. Even when my wife brings up  that I am doing my this without any help, they tout the same lines as always it is not our responsibility it is his mother he has the means to care for her but chooses not to because it is inconvenient for you guys. Which is not wrong, if I capped out my salary and withdrew from my savings I could afford to place my mom where she wants to go. Though to do that that means my wife will have handle all of our expenses, and that is not fair nor possible for her. She is a teacher, she barely makes a fraction of what I make.   I knew this was going to backfire, I knew that I did not have the resolve to hear that my mother about my mother suffering, see my wife forcibly be dragged into this mess and judged because she refuses to help me care for someone that treats her like a sub-human. I knew my family would try to spin their hypocrisy and shame me into giving up everything. I was told today by them that I could always earn that money back, but you can never earn time back with your mother. When I tell them I am young and they should not put everything on my shoulders, they told me 28 is not young you lived a good life.   I am at a loss, this choice has cascaded into a landslide of pain and heartache. Overall I dislike the situation but my actions to try and speed up the placement progression cause I cannot handle it is making this worse for myself cause my garbage family is making everything worse. I know the fact I have become lifeless is making my wife feel guilty for not helping, which is not my intent nor desire. I do not want her help my mother’s wellness and wellbeing should be the responsibility of her entire family not just mine.  I reached out to her care team and they told me what I did expect would happen? They gave those recommendations for a reason sometimes medical interventions do not work. They did tell me I understand where you see coming from, but the problem is your mother requires things that is not common in facilities and she cannot tolerate medication well enough so she can go into a common facility. They told me to accept your hand, she will get worse with time and once she gets it is possible her behaviors will start to subside. It is the waiting game, since she is in a weird spot. Her functionality is EO, it is her working memory that is taking the impact. Her reserves in terms of physical functionality are extremely high, for the most part she is operating on muscle memory. Unfortunately also means she does not trust new people, she trusts her current doctors because many of  have been her doctors from before I was even born, and one she even dated in the past. She is very close with them, and for the most part can even have normal conversations with them. I am worried say if I take her home and she does not get better, and these behaviors sick. Illegitimately made my mother worse quicker and I have to live with that.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/59376/psych-is-requesting-i-take-my-mother-home,,,AlzConnected-v2,2022-01-04 03:27:16,789128,98.0
1748,647b5c49091b6ef899d1f28a,59392,,I'm not sure how much longer I can persevere...new to boards and need help!,"Thank you for listening, I'll try to abbreviate this: I am the caregiver for my mother, I'm 60 - she is 86. Father died 10 years ago. We moved to the south last April from the northeast, I am her only child, a female, divorced, no children. We live in absolute paradise - sunshine, nice house (not fancy or new, but solid), beach five minutes away, but it's never enough. She refuses to see a doctor, however, has agreed in the past (but won't anymore) to visit with a doctor on Doctor on Demand - she says the doctors here in our state aren't ""like they are at home"" (in other words, good enough - but she had a very poor doc up north that had two lawsuits against him). Doc on Demand - lovely woman, gave her low-dose Zoloft for depression and an anxiety pill (not sure of the name, but stated it was very safe). We went over her meds several times with her while online. I wrote down the exact words the doc stated, and we showed mom what I wrote. I have a Ph.D and the doc told her to listen to me because I would never try to mess her up with her meds. Day later - I ""messed up what the doctor said, and what I wrote was incorrect."" Because of that, she refuses to take the anxiety pill. Mom will take her BP pill, low-dose aspirin and vitamins, but after starting the Zoloft, stopped suddenly (big no-no), and now wants to start them again because she says they're for anxiety. Tried to tell her again tonight the difference between the two, had both pill bottles thrown at me, was called a know it all, and told to get out. The anxiety pill is low dose, and supposedly will help her sleep - which is also non-existent - she walks the halls all night, yells for me to turn on the AC or heat at 2, 3, 4 in the morning. I'm exhausted. When I tell her I want to take a nap on a Sunday afternoon, I'm berated, and told ""great, I have to stay at home while you decide to sleep."" Her short term memory is almost non-existent...I have to take her through multiple steps to get her to remember where we ate the night before, what someone said, where she shopped, etc. She gets very very angry when she can't remember, and screams at me that I'm either wrong, lying, or a know it all. She has also begun screaming at me in front of crowds - restaurants, shops - and tells me with an evil smile to keep it up, and she'll just scream at me louder to embarrass me. She is convinced that our neighbors are evil, and claims the neighbor across the street hates her because they told her their political party did not align with hers and they didn't want to socialize with her. I was there when the conversation occurred - never any mention about politics - they caught us on the third day of our move when mom was having a hissy fit sitting in the car (she never talked to them - it was me). While we certainly do have some strange neighbors, Mom is convinced that the only place where everyone is good is back in the north (which she wanted to leave as much as me). I wait on her hand and foot even though she's very able - walks (with a lot of pain, but won't go see about it), can cook but doesn't know how to turn on our stove (never learned in this new house, refuses to do so). If she's hungry, it's my fault because I starved her all day. We go out to eat every night of the week, and then I have to take her on a long ride after. I would give anything to sit in my office recliner and rest. She found out last week that her brother in law has been dead since early November, and now wants to call his only daughter and confront her about ""not telling her."" (She didn't talk to her sister, his wife, for 10 years until the last year of her life when her sister had cancer and they reconciled.) The sole surviving relative in the northeast is a cousin, but she refuses to speak to her anymore because the cousin has never initiated a call to my mom. She tells me that she should go back north to see all the smiling faces, but then breaks down crying when she realizes that everyone she knew is dead. She's Italian, apologies to fellow Italians out there, but she gets very mean, very fast, has always swayed between telling me that I'm the worst person in the world yet tells everyone she meets that she has the smartest daughter in the world because I have a Ph.D. If I have a glass of wine at night, I'm an alcoholic like her father. If I have two glasses, I don't get spoken to the rest of the night. We have lived here since April 24th, I have been out three times by myself.  She needs to see a dentist asap due to her dentures. She has very good dental insurance. When I ask her if she would like to make an appointment she screams and berates me, and tells me she'll do it when she chooses to do so (which will be never, but she'll kvetch about her teeth). She makes herself so upset that she vomits - she did that tonight. She also refused to take most of her pills tonight because she claims she took them this morning (she didn't), and that when she dies it will be on my hands. She makes me handle her checkbook - every day I show her the balance, and details. Her checking account remains within a couple of thousand of where she asked it to be, her savings account has never been touched, and she has a retirement account with our broker from which they forward funds every month. Even showing her the live balance online - she doesn't believe, and just knows I've made a mistake with her money. It took me six days to unravel her bank account last spring before we moved - double postings, missing deposits, etc. She cannot handle her account, and cries because she cannot. I do not need her money - I have two retirement accounts that I will tap at 65, and plan to take social security (if it's still available) at that time. Every. Single. Day I have to hear that she is dying, that I don't care, and all she wants to do is go be with my dad.  Yes, she's been this way to me all my life. I've been the super over achiever constantly trying to garner enough accolades in life to make her proud of me, I have the Ph.D., I'm a published author, I've worked in positions that afforded her the opportunity to meet pro sports players, celebrities, and top politicians, I've won awards that I never knew I had been nominated for, but none of it matters, and I've realized that will never happen. Brags to everyone else, but pushes me away. My father was the loving parent, which I'm reminded that I don't have him to run to anymore. New Year's Eve was the anniversary of my dad's death - she's been allowed to cry all month, I cried briefly the other day when something reminded me of him, and she told me to stop. My nerves are shot...I've made a tee time for tomorrow to golf, but she wants to come along and ride along with me. When I'm on the phone in my office for business, she comes in and sits and listens in. Don't ask me to tell her I deserve privacy...it's her house, she bought it, and if I don't like it I can get out. In all honesty, with the real estate market in our area (seller's market - including rentals), I cannot afford to get out at present. The only thing I have faced her down on is her threat to move back to the northeast - I've begun to tell her to go ahead, and that I'm not coming with her. I walk on egg shells every minute of every day. I can't call friends from back home because she sits in on the conversation - even when I have my ear pods on, then demands to know what they said. If you don't tell her, there's hell to pay. I do have a POA - just signed last spring - it is all encompassing. I don't know what to do...I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't and I'm not sure how much more I can take. She has no friends (nor does she want to meet anyone), I have no friends here and I don't want to burden friends from back home by calling them. I am self harming by pinching and digging at my my upper arm with my nails where she cannot see it. It keeps me from yelling at her (because I know she would attempt to slap me), and it helps me bring myself into the here and now. I promised her I would never put her in a home, but I'm hanging on to the very last thread of my existence, and I also know she would disown me if I did so. I can't go to a support group, nor could I join a video group online - she would listen in, and I would not be able to talk. I can't even get out of the house to go to one because I'll be accused of letting her sit at home with nothing to do. If you have read this to this point, thanks for listening. It helped to write it, but there is nothing I can do about it. I guess I have to accept that until she dies (and her side lives into their 90's), this is my penance, and if she lives that long, the last years of my life when I could have finally enjoyed myself will be over.

I’m 95% certain it’s time for my mom to be in one.  The proverbial last strawberry happened earlier this week when my mom physically assaulted my father. It’s not the first time, but it was intense and I fear it could escalate by her just happening to be near something sharp and grabbing it.  My father has been in a lot of denial, understandably, as her primary caregiver.  I sat him down and told him we are at a point where it’s too much for him, it’s not safe, and they’re both suffering.  She’s not getting the care she could really benefit from and his mental and physical health are suffering.  Mine is too as I’m at their place several days a week and have started neglecting some of my responsibilities.  Compounding all of this is an upcoming hip replacement in three weeks, which I know can greatly exacerbate her cognitive challenges   I have visited six facilities near them and I liked them all and know she would benefit greatly.  My father is despondent at the thought of her not being at home all the time and I’m trying to get him to see he will get the best of both worlds in an impossible situation:  he will be able to do things he can’t while getting to be a husband again while she gets care she needs    Back to the 95% number. That 5% doubt is when she shows flashes of her old self.  There are some times when she’s fairly lucid, although it’s fleeting.  And there’s the hope that perhaps after surgery when she’s not in pain she will rebound a bit (she will be spending 1-2 weeks at a skilled nursing facility and then would go to the MC facility or home).  I imagine everyone struggles with this decision, so anything that anyone can offer with a terrible awful decision would be much appreciated.  ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/58417/when-is-it-time-for-a-mc-facility,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-10-09 16:12:53,778044,3.0

She was living alone in her own home until about 6 months ago. We placed her into MC in March 2021. She has always been active and walked/paced for hours each day. We are now on our 3rd facility. The first was ridiculously understaffed, and we moved her shortly after placement. The second was okay until she began falling about a month ago. They basically kicked her out due to falling. Now we’re in a good spot with the new facility. She was just accepted into hospice about 3 weeks ago. Fell again after being here a few days. This time she broke her arm. She’s in a sling and we’re not doing surgery. She’s on morphine for pain. It’s been 5 days since the injury. She is so sedated and barely eating and drinking. Maybe 25 percent of her usual intake. I’m concerned about dehydration. Hospice team is stating that this may be her body’s way of shutting down. It all seems so abrupt. Do folks succumb after a broken arm?

She made her wishes clear in this kind of situation, so all we can do now is make our precious mom as comfortable as possible as she transitions. I am in shock, pain, and immense grief.

I am angry that I was not able to see her for almost 2 years because of the pandemic (I live 3,000 miles away, although I am with her now). I am overwhelmed at the thought of all my sister and I have to juggle (we don't have much other family in the area) on top of the emotional turmoil we are going through. I am grateful that I was able to speak with her via Skype just hours before this happened, to have had one last conversation with her. We are visiting her daily, reading to her, playing her music, and she knows we are there. She holds my hand so tight, and while she cannot really speak or open her eyes, I am cherishing these moments we can still have together. I guess I just wanted to share this news as this community has been so helpful and kind. I am at a loss for what I will do without my mom. If anyone has recommendations on books or resources to manage grief, I would appreciate them.

1754,647b5cc2091b6ef899d1f861,57488,,Caring for unofficial VD/Alz 75F while parenting young child and a baby,"Caution: Long read!   Good day to everyone.   I am new to this community, though earlier in my life, as a young adult watching from the sidelines, I saw what Alz did to my grandmother and the burdens it put on my parents and extended family here.  She was at least fortunate to have lived a long life by the time things got real bad.  She passed away mercifully just years shy of 100.  And now it’s me and wife on the front lines this time, but with my MIL, and I am glad to have found this community.DW and I share a home in Virginia with my MIL.  She is 75 and widowed for many years now. While not officially diagnosed (we are increasingly frustrated by our inability to get her seen by a neurologist, but that’s another story), I can tell you that she will almost always forget that she did something within minutes of said event.  She has some other tell tale signs like rarely knowing what day of the week it is.  Asking if it’s 9am or 9pm even if she can see the sun is out.  All after we’ve placed some pretty big clocks with time, day of the week, etc. around the house.  Still she has enough autonomy to do her own (light) loads of laundry, even if she might forget a load is in the wash.  She can check her own blood pressure, blood sugar, etc.  She’ll often pour herself a 2nd bowl of cereal thinking it was the first.  MIL is on a cocktail of vitamins, pills, and eyedrops for her glaucoma, high blood pressure, and diabetes.  She is blind in one eye and less than good vision in the good eye, so she just shuffles across the house.Before her short term memory seemingly vanished overnight (more on that later) she was a huge help in our home, helping with meals, upkeep of the downstairs space, and even taking care of our first child for hours-long stretches so wife and I could step away once in a while.   Fast forward several years and now we worry about her even holding our newborn.   Her taking our baby to her bedroom unmonitored is out of the question.Over the years we could tell her memory was getting worse.  That was always to be expected.   Once in a blue moon she had stretches of insomnia.  Prescribed sleep medicines caused her to have hallucinations (visits from dead relatives).  But we figured she’s older, people react to medicines differently all the time.   When she doesn’t sleep well, we’d often find notes in the kitchen “Couldn’t sleep.  Went back to bed at 5am” her way of telling us she’s fine and let her sleep in.   The frequency of these notes increased over the months leading to her hospitalization in June.  And then she stopped writing the notes.Dinner discussions became awfully repetitive over the years.  She likes to talk and gossip, so it’s often “Did you know…” something that we knew because she told us weeks ago and nearly every day since.   And she never picked up on our stern “yes. we know.”   Or the flip side: she’ll ask us something, we’ll answer, and she’ll ask it again the next day.She’s been misplacing things more often.  Sometimes we chalked that up to her vision like looking for a mug literally in front of her.  Then she started doing  things like placing kitchen items in the wrong spaces.  Doesn’t seem like a big deal but this is from the same meticulous woman that basically reorganized our kitchen storage in years past.    Now sometimes we pull a pot out of the cupboard only to find it had water inside.   The worst event was this winter when I came home to a kitchen reeking of natural gas with my then-pregnant wife unaware in the room above.When our baby arrived just months ago, our older child stayed with other family in the area and we left MIL home alone.   When we returned home, MIL was upset that we had disappeared on her, not remembering that we told her (on many occasions) that DW was being induced, not understanding why we didn’t answer her call during the birth process, not remembering the call my DW returned the next morning.  Up to this point, her memory seemed relatively normal.Then in June of this year, my MIL self-checked her BP to find it in the low 200’s.   After a second check to make sure she was doing it right,  DW took her to the ER where they found her sodium had fallen into the 120’s.  135 is the lower bound of normal levels. That night in the ER exam room, she asked DW why they had gone to the ER.   So she spent a week at the hospital while they stabilized her BP and brought her sodium up.     Throughout the week, she called DW’s phone throughout the day and night.   “I haven’t had breakfast.”  “Nobody’s given my medicines.”  “What medicines do I take now?”  “Can you bring lunch?”  “Why am I here?”She had to have a safety nurse sit in the room with her to keep her in bed and escort her to the restroom.   Because her walk is more of a shuffle -- which I think started when her vision in her “good” eye got worse -- the hospital recommended putting her in a live-in physical rehab facility next to the hospital.  Again there were the phone calls from MIL to DW.  Iate-ness with my DW and the rehab staff who in her mind weren’t giving her medicines or feeding her.    She checked herself out (she can still “shuffle” wherever she needs to go which isn’t far in this house) and DW picked her up 2 days into what would have been weeks of physical therapy.When she came home, DW took over giving MIL her medicines, vitamins, and eyedrops.  Simply because she can’t be trusted to self medicate in her state.  In her normal state of mind, MIL understands when we explain this.  However, because of her short term memory problem, we also  get the “did I take my morning meds?” (yes at 9am)  “are you sure? I don’t remember!”   “What did you eat?  I need to eat.”  (when she ate minutes earlier. Usually cereal).  We spend our time on separate floors -- MIL’s room is downstairs, while ours are upstairs.   So instead of yelling across the house, MIL has been in the habit of dialing DW’s cellphone.   This is a practice she’s had for years.  Often calling DW at work to ask things like “what are we doing for dinner” “something is wrong with the TV” and many other things that could wait til she got home.  So now DW gets phone calls at all hours of the day for the same basic issues.  Her meals and meds.   This applies to the night as well, but  even worse.  If she feels the slightest bit off -- blurry vision (it’s always blurry), headache, high BP (she can still check her own BP) -- and if she can’t get my DW on the phone, she would come up the stairs (already a bad idea given side effects of her sleep/neuro meds) and have the same conversation of “where are my pills” (DW has them) “why” (so you don’t take them, forget, and accidentally overdose yourself) “just give them to me” (why) “so i can have them.  You can’t do this to me.  Those are my medicines You’re not a doctor.  Why aren’t you giving medicines to me”  (I do, every night)  “No you didn’t.  My BP is high.  I need to take it” (You already did) “I can take it again…”   Eventually DW gets it in MIL’s head that she needs to sleep.   And lately started escorting her to her bed, making sure she gets in it,  cuts the lights, and makes sure she’s asleep.  Her diet has also been particularly poor since coming home from that ER visit.  In hindsight, it wasn't great before it either. Perhaps contributing to that sodium drop. These days we have to remind or encourage her to eat.  She’s pickier than ever.  Usually complaining about something being “too salty” and that she has to watch her sodium.  Reminds us every chance she gets that she’s worried about getting a stroke if her BP gets too high.  (Or going blind if she doesn’t get that eyedrop she doesn’t remember taking an hour ago.)  We’ve noticed that she cooks for herself less and less.  And what she does cook has been increasingly basic.   Going from chicken salad sandwiches, to egg salad sandwiches, to canned soups or instant noodles.   Lately it’s been bowls upon bowls of Special K.   These days we do all the cooking -- and buying.  The wealth of to-go food and availability of grocery-pick-up couldn't have come at a better time. Though our wallets surely feel the pain.In a month DW’s maternity ends and she’s back to WFH 40 hrs a week,  and likely working from the office 45 min away by year’s end.  DW’s latest tactic to reclaim some of her own sanity and sleep has been to put her phone on silent, barricade the stairs with a tall shoe rack and a heavy plastic tank of emergency water in front to keep that in place.  I’m already taking big drops in productivity at work (WFH for now, but probably working from the office again sooner or later) taking time to watch the baby while DW and MIL go to urgent care, ER, PCP.  They’ve toured one place which MIL already bristled at because of cost.  Even if the place still smelled brand new, was lovely inside and out, and seemed to have many good reviews.  They didn’t have availability for weeks/months anyway.  They’re going to tour another place soon, this time a religious non-profit that we hope appeals to her more.  It’s also in a part of town where MIL lived and raised DW so maybe a return to a familiar area (we now live across town) would also appeal.  At least she is somewhat receptive to leaving the house now.   In months past she had that tell-tale anger at the notion of her being senile.  Though even now she insists hiring in-home help would be enough (and cheaper).  But in our mind, that won’t stop the drama around her “missing” medicine, won’t solve her diet issues, and will likely cost just as much to have someone all-day like we think she really needs.   Having heard the stories from my DW, my MIL’s sister offered to take her in, herself a career nurse working in psych wards.  Wouldn’t have been indefinite.  She still has a day job, but she wanted to see her sister for herself, and afford us a much needed break.  But given what DW’s told her over the weeks, even MIL’s sister thinks MIL would not be safe at her home overnight.  She agrees she would be better cared for by a dedicated facility.While we have little experience in dealing w/ Alz.  We only “know” what we read online at places like this and the slices of life I witnessed around my grandmother.  We know even less about the legal and financial aspects of all this: getting POA, hiring a CELA, Medicare/caid, securing her money from fraudsters, putting money in trusts, etc.  Fortunately she is relatively wary of cold callers (unlike some of my own extended family) but who knows how long that will last.    Having myself done her taxes for her this year (thanks COVID) we also have a rough idea of MIL’s assets and retirement income, but we don’t know how long we need to make it last.  As I said at the beginning, we don’t even know if it’s truly Alz/VD/MD until we can see a neurologist, but PCP is taking forever to make that referral (which they already said they would do) and we can’t seem to see one without that.  The memory medicines she has been taking since late June have not been helping, though her poor sleep and diet may be hindering the effectiveness.  Still, we are trying to place her somewhere she can get the care she needs while giving us the ability to breathe and sleep again.  DW is under incredible stress between watching her last living parent decline, administering MIL meds, dealing with all the phone calls from downstairs, handling all MIL’s appts/referrals, looking for a ALF/NH/MC, and caring for the newborn.   All while the clock ticks toward her return to the workforce.  I do what I can to lighten her load.  Whether it’s intercepting the MIL before she makes it to DW’s bedroom to ask yet another “did I take my pills” type question, or watching the kids while DW takes MIL to another scheduled (or unscheduled) appt.   Ironically when MIL is watching the newborn (with us hovering nearby) it blissfully solves two of our largest caregiving problems for that moment.  Then we’ll come back to earth when the baby is crying and she’ll ask “maybe she’s hungry? Where’s the bottle”  even though MIL was just feeding her minutes ago and the empty bottle is on the table next to her.  There’s times like lunch when MIL is often the clearest of mind, and we have reasonably normal discussions.  “What did we order for lunch?  What kind of sandwich is this?  Wow look at these steak fries.”   Times like this we sometimes doubt the need for her to live elsewhere and miss out on watching her grandkids grow up.  But then we just have to think about those awful nights and other bad times, that we remember that this is for the best.  We really hoped for that first ALF/MC location to pan out as it’s near the hospital and just minutes from our current home.  Perhaps it still could be.  As frustratingly slow this process and the feeling of helplessness as we are left to deal with this ourselves, we tell ourselves it will all work out in the end.Sorry about the preceding “wall of text.”  As someone once said, “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.”  We are still poring through posts here looking at situations we can relate to at this phase while also getting peeks at what may be to come.  I guess what we’re hoping to receive from sharing all this is a better understanding of our next steps towards finding her care, securing her finances, insulating my impressionable child from the drama (“baby’s crying again. why is mommy yelling? is mommy mad at grandma?”), giving DW and I time and space to breathe and raise our kids, all without quickly burning through MIL’s hard earned retirement -- or our own for that matter.   It’s already a shame my FIL couldn’t enjoy his retirement years due to cancer.  My MIL took an early retirement to care for him.  And it saddens all of us that we may be looking at MIL on the first stages of another difficult journey of her own.Thank you for reading!",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/57488/caring-for-unofficial-vd-alz-75f-while-parenting-young-child-and-a-baby,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-07-19 13:20:07,776842,5.0

Im 3 hours from her but would visit often or have her here with me and the kids for months at a time and she was always so much better and always happy. My siblings live by me but rarely bother to even visit. I've been paying her bills, fixing passwords and doing all the ""keep this between you and me cause people will think I'm crazy "" stuff since 2018. My step dad also always calls on me when he needs anything. She was last here 8 months ago for 6 weeks. She was wanting to go home and I offered to drive the whole distance since it was a day early and I guess this upset my step dad. He started messaging my older sister then I was told I'm a pain to deal with and why can't I stick to the plans. I finally got brave enough to ask why my mother couldn't come home if he's just sitting there and I'm doing all the driving. I guess that ruined it for me. I took her back at their arranged time and he didn't even hug her. He brushed past her open arms and left after she got in his car not saying a word to either of us. She was hurt. I told her not to worry everything was ok. I should have put her back in my car and kept her at that moment. She called me and I nearly fell over. She was on speaker phone and said she wanted me to leave her alone that I'm making trouble there and to stop calling. My kids and fiance were by me and their jaws dropped as tears rolled down my face as I pleaded, begged and apologized for whatever it was I did and said how much I love her. She said goodbye and hung up. Since then she has just deteriorated tremendously. She sneaks to call me and says she is sorry and hopes I understand that she has to live with him and if she upsets him he's horrible to her. And he is. He screams about her not being able to remember anything and reminds her she has alzheimer's which you are never to do. I finally recorded it and him threatening to move if she ever came to see me. I finally called the local protection agency after years of holding back and now she won't even talk to me because they did a welfare check and he told her it was me even though it's anonymous. My siblings went off on me and said I made things worse and I don't love my mother. Im the youngest and we are the closest. She requested I do her POA in 2019 and not tell anyone because she didn't want to hear about it and knew i would do what was right for her. I did what she asked but unfortunately I didn't know to have it notarized. Now he took her and had a POA in his name done. She didn't request it, she told me when she asked me that she just doesn't trust him. Well....my siblings are ok with her being treated this way and love that I am suffering. I wasn't allowed in the house since May, he pushed her out on the porch when I got there the one time he allowed me and the kids and I took her to lunch and she had to find her way into the house because we couldn't even use the bathroom. Drove back home. Now she won't even talk to me since the investigation. Im sick. My kids are missing school and devastated because she is a huge part of our family. She has never stayed with anyone but us. The social worker spoke to my siblings and suggested they, not me, make 2 visits per month to give her much older husband a break. I was not contacted again. They never side with me and if she lived with me they made it clear they would not have their lives interfered with that it's on me AND THAT'S FINE! She never wanted them to visit when they did make an hour available for her because she has to act like she's expected to by them like I do. They are judgmental but make poor choices from their pedestals but have lots of money so it's excusable. My mother and I stopped going to get together years ago because her and I sat in a corner entertaining each other and snuck out asap because it was no fun for us. I don't know what to do. He's poisoning what is left of her mind about me and when he decides he's had enough I'm the only one who sincerely wants my mother with me. They plan to put her in a home. I promised her I never would let that happen. Please, PLEASE give me any advice you can.

The problem persists that 2 ladies, one on either end of the hall, are constantly screaming in terror. They certainly can't help it, but the facility is unable to provide relief to these poor suffering people. CMS and other regulating bodies prohibit the use of sedative medications in long term care, and largely any mood altering medications of any class(antidepressants, pain medications, anti-psychotics...). Before I get ""flamed"", I know their are exceptions, but on the whole, a nursing home will loose brownie points with the Medicare.gov webpage for reviewing care facilities, and can be fined or lose accredation for providing the relief these residents desperately need. These poor people are suffering, and are making the floor very unpleasant for the other residents, many of whom don't understand why no one is rushing to the aid of someone screaming for help.  One more example of why people with a PolySci.or Law degree shouldn't be making regulations about healthcare. It seems even healthcare professionals, once they enter a regulating body or political position, lose any perspective on patient's needs.  One last note. If you are looking into placing a loved one into long term care, try to get their doctor to aggressively treat any anxiety/depression, or other mood disorder or pain problem in the community.

He's developed another UTI (less than a month since he got out of the hospital from the previous one). I've had to give him morphine for the pain.  His last BM was a week ago and he's taking miralax to hopefully get some relief. He hasn't had enough morphine to cause the constipation and eats cream of wheat with applesauce or yogurt at least twice a day, drinks 5-6 bottles of Ensure plus 3 bottles of fruit punch or juice each day.  It was a struggle to get him to eat today. He would bite down hard on the spoon and I had to use mild force to pry it out of his mouth or he wouldn't open his mouth so I could feed him. He only had half a bottle of ensure then either refused to open his mouth for the straw or couldn't connect how to open his mouth.  He's stage 7, is bedridden and can't feed himself. His nurse comes tomorrow and I will discuss these issues with her. More UTI episodes are sure to happen with his incontinence even though I change him when he pees as soon as I notice it.  It tears me up to see him like that. I'm sure that's what we all feel but in late stage dementia it's almost like there's only the body still there. The soul is no longer present to give hope. His eyes are glazed and he can't respond to smiles or questions or turns his head when you talk to him.  For those who wonder, he's only had morphine doses 3 times Saturday night and at 2:00 am and 2:30 pm today and the strength as prescribed. My question is, at what stage or point in this process do we accept or determine our loved one has already left us?   This is a very dark time for me. I knew it was coming, we all do.

Her physical health is fairly robust - eats well, at good weight, other physical risks have been well managed. As her condition has progressed, we do everything we can to keep her out of the ER and hospital because psychological stress has shown to be physically risky for her. She had a fall recently which showed a lumber vertebrae compression. The vertebrae, previously fractured in an earlier fall, has become compressed and they are recommending surgery. I'm meeting with the neurosurgeon to discuss their recommendations and better understand the diagnosis, inherent risks, recommended procedure, risks of the procedure, and expected benefits. My concern is that surgery for her could be a dangerous affair. Not doing surgery could be dangerous too. It's not clear to me that any of us understand how much pain she's in due to this compressed, fractured vertebrae. I would very much appreciate your thoughts on the risks of surgery for an 84 year old dementia patient. Is it absolutely a no-no to have surgery at this stage? What should I know?

Dad is Stage 5/6 and probably has life expectancy of two to four years, based on what I know of his condition. He also has stage 3b chronic kidney disease but no other health problems. The only alternative to restorative work mentioned by the dentist is extraction. Dad's PCP said she would defer to the dentist's recommendation but she advised me to question the need to do anything and said maybe antibiotics could be tried if the tooth causes problems. The problem with that approach is... potential for excruciating dental pain and a trip to the ER. I've read some of the dental message threads on this board, but still don't know what to do to minimize Dad's discomfort and risk of infection. He can no longer maintain his dental hygiene but won't let us help him brush and floss.

1765,647b5d32091b6ef899d1fdec,57969,,Skilled Nursing challenges for dementia patient,"Mom passed away in June but this is an issue that needs addressing. I believe that Mom's ""dementia"" was mostly aphasia. She was not officially diagnosed. She could read out loud accurately but she couldn't string words together, on her own, to make a meaningful sentence. I believe our speech was probably garbled by her hearing in the same way. She seemed to think pretty clearly but couldn't express what she needed. Her memory was good. When we listened to her ramblings we could eventually pick out a subject and then guess from there. Hand motions and facial expressions (without masks) were more effective. She also had trouble with numbers, calendars and clocks; not knowing what was higher\lower, earlier\later, etc. After a fall landed my Mom in the hospital, they recommended Skilled Nursing (SN) for physical therapy (PT). It was hard for us (husband of 69 years and 3 children) to know if\where she hurt and how much. Mom was VERY active, walking\caring for herself, etc, before the fall. I asked for SN references from her Memory Care unit. The first 2 we talked to said they couldn't accommodate her with her dementia. The third still had a fair rating but I was beginning to get concerned about the level of care she'd get. The hospital talked to them and they accepted Mom without even talking to me. I'm guessing I gave the first 2 too much information about Mom's activity level before the fall? I think the hospital was pressured to move her out. She was making some progress in SN and they were planning her discharge. But communication with the facility was frustrating to non-existent.

The problem is, she thinks the doctors/being in the hospital 3 years ago was what caused her memory loss. She fell on the ice and fractured her hip and was in the hospital and in a lot of pain for a while, and it coincided with her onset of serious dementia symptoms. She has refused to go since then, multiple times a day stating that her brain doesn't work since she went to the hospital and the doctors did something to her brain. She also struggles with depression/anxiety and did before her diagnosis for years. The past couple of months, she's spent a lot of time saying she wants to die and she's sick and to let her die. This week my grandpa (her spouse of 60+ years) passed away. Now she's beside herself with depression, confusion, and frustration and just wants to die. It's hard now to differentiate between normal grief, pre-existing depression, and her disease. Regardless, I desperately want a doctor to evaluate her. I don't know how I or my mom would be able to get her there. I'm afraid of her anger outbursts and her mistrusting me if I take her, but I'm more afraid of how things will progress without a doctor visit/guidance. Am I just stuck being the bad guy and have to live with that for a while with her? Does anyone have any advice on how they've handled LO's fear/mistrust of the doctor?

1768,647b5d37091b6ef899d1fe28,58009,,LO with Alzheimers / Dementia and trying to treat Osteoarthritis,"Has anyone had to deal with a LO with Alzheimers / Dementia who is telling everyone that they have pain but based upon physical examination you can't figure out if it is real or perceived based upon how their LO's brain is functioning?  My 84 year old mother has had some leg swelling and pain over the several weeks. She is morbidly obese and has mid stage Alzheimers / Dementia. The initial diagnosis by the AL MC facility doctor and staff was that it is osteoarthritis based upon their examination and xray of her leg. They had also noticed some lymphodema and were wrapping Mom's leg or having Mom wear compression socks. I have also talked to the staff about applying ice packs to her leg and that does seem to help a bit. The facility doctor has also arranged for light physical therapy and a knee brace. We have also tried to work with the AL MC staff to minimize her snacking to hopefully cause her to lose some weight but don't that doesn't seem to working. These are all treatments that are recommended for osteoarthritis. Mom was sure that it was a problem with her leg bones so I took her to an orthopedic doctor who did more xrays and informed us that the bones in her leg as well as the knee and hip replacement hardware are all in place and looking fine. Because Mom didn't get the answer she wanted, she thought the doctor didn't know what he was talking about and thought we wasted the day.  I took Mom to another PCP who examined her leg and told her that Mom that she saw some signs of lymphodema and that compression socks and water pills were appropriate. The doctor didn't think it was gout or cellulitus. This doctor did do some blood work to rule out stroke and and the results came back that Mom was having some issues with blood flow in her capillary veins but nothing major. The doctor recommended we try using gabapentin to help with the pain by treating the nerves in her leg. We have increased the gabapentin three times in the past couple of weeks but it still doesn't seem to be working. The last remaining thing the doctor suggested was an EMG test that checks how the nerves are firing in muscle tissue. This is our last resort.  Going through this process, it is obvious that my mother is struggling to understand what the doctors are telling her. She just wants a quick fix and I am afraid that doesn't exist. And I am struggling trying to explain to her that there might not be a fix for it and she may just have to live with it. I am afraid she will continue to complain about it as her memory continues to decline and I will have to get in a mode of making something up each time regarding treating it. I am also wondering how much of the pain is in her mind versus actually physical.  I will continue to work with the AL MC facility staff to try to manage this situation as I can't continue to rack my brain on possible medical solutions or to continue to take her to doctors who just confirm what we have already heard. I am sure there is no easy fix or even a fix for this situation and it is wearing me out. I can schedule her for an EMG test but frankly I don't think it is going to solve this situation and it will cost a lot of money. If you have gone through something similar, I would be interested in how you handled that situation. ",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/58009/lo-with-alzheimers-dementia-and-trying-to-treat-osteoarthritis,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-08-30 21:51:24,679034,24.0

My mother is 85 years old and has vascular dementia. She is completely immobile, and her food intake is at about 25 percent. Her liquid intake has declined to about 3 cups a day. She spends most of her time sleeping, but she does frequently yell out with physical aches and pains. She has a stage 4 pressure sore on her coccyx and two skin tears. We recently had to move her to long-term care because there was a shortage of in-home caregivers, and we just couldn't provide the care she needed. On Friday, the facility let us know that mom tested positive for Covid. She had been vaccinated this summer. I have been in touch with her facility nurse and hospice nurse daily since the diagnosis. Her Covid symptoms have been mild to nonexistent with the exception of extreme fatigue and disinterest in food and drink (which were already going on before the Covid). Today the nurse called to tell me mom has been in extreme pain. She said a simple touch to the arm will make her yell out in pain. They have been giving her morphine and methadone. When the nurse called today, she stated that she had promised me she would call anytime she noticed a significant change in her. Reading between the lines, I deduced that the nurse is saying it is bad.  Has anyone else on here had an experience with a loved one with dementia being diagnosed with Covid? I am particularly curious about Covid-vaccinated patients with dementia testing positive for Covid. Because the vaccine is so new, I can't find much information out there regarding this topic. If you all have any insights into what this experience might be like for someone in her condition, I would be grateful if you would share.

It was the second session with supervision from a very experienced private caregiver. We had a brief initial meet and greet visit that went well. In the first session my mother asked to leave to visit a friend in an apartment on our floor. That day the caregiver's distractions worked. Yesterday my mother was angry and swearing under her breath to get this evil woman out (the caregiver looks a bit like someone my mother had a dispute with). It got so bad that I had to delay my work appointments and asked the caregiver to leave and come back in 15 minutes. Nevertheless my mother kept asking me to take the caregiver with her although I said this was my friend who I had known for years. She wasn't violent but twice made motions as if to bite me. She made statements such as the caregiver can't stay because I need to go out to meet someone (not true). For the first time my mother had a hallucination. The door was open and she waved and said hello to someone who wasn't there. I distracted her and left when she was in another room. Then my mother called me as I was driving. I distracted her by talking about food and promised to bring her baked treats. The caregiver tried to engage her in conversation but found that being mostly silent presented less of a trigger. Due to increased confusion I had her urine checked and there is no UTI. I tried to manage her back pain by giving her a strong pain killer. Please provide any suggestions as I fear the caregiver will quit.  Thanks in advance. Edited to add that today was even worse. The caregiver was almost struck and had the flee.

Did that. Had a chat with the doctor in private regarding my need to pull back some from their care ( ruining my marriage and my sanity)  and  about some of Dads stubborn and callous behavior - which the doctor saw today. Dad supposedly doesn’t have dementia.  Doctor thought mom was doing much better cognitively after 6 weeks on the antidepressant mirtrazipine. Doctor ordered blood work and X-rays on Mom because of her back pain, So we went to lunch and then got X-rays.  Then took them to the phone store because Dad wanted a new flip phone.  Dropped them off at 4, and then went home. Tried to rest- my knee is bone on bone. Got the X-ray results, communicated with my sister for about an hour on those - she’s an expert on back medical terms. Ate a snack, did some sewing.

Then he called my stepbrother tonight like nothing had happened. Who told him off …. On speaker and my mom heard it.  So then my stepbrother calls me to fill me in, my mom tries calling repeatedly while I’m talking to him. He also tells me that my stepsister was helping Dad move all ‘his’ money to another  bank.  This is money that was originally in a joint account and he moved it to under his control two years ago and is now trying to move it again, why?  Because I’ve made him pay bills out of it that would have come out of the  joint account  had he not moved the money.  I’ve had possession of the checkbooks since neither of them now know how to write checks or balance a check register.  Earlier Today I had him sign checks for his health insurance and the pharmacy bill from ‘his’ account,  he used his debit card to pay for the  phone.I mailed those checks on the way home.  So now I find out that there may not be money in that account to cover those checks. I have no online access to that account since it’s only in his name.  So I have  to call the bank tomorrow and explain the situation and see if they will at least tell me if those checks will clear  I had to call both my sisters tonight about this - who live out of state and aren’t interested in helping, but they  did listen.

1781,647b5da4091b6ef899d20399,56544,,After the fall(1),"Hi all, and hope you are as well as is possible. I’m sorry to say that my mother fell on April 17 and fractured her hip. We will not pursue surgery and she is now bed bound. Due to the pain it causes, they cannot get her out of bed and only move her as is needed for care/hygiene.  Obviously it’s been very stressful and I am just now checking in here.  For background, my mother is in later stage dementia (probably Alzheimer’s?) and before this fall was completely ambulatory. She is still surprisingly verbal. She is in a memory cafe unit at a facility near me. She has been on hospice since May 2020.  She had Covid last August when her facility had an outbreak.  She lost a lot of weight with Covid but otherwise recovered well. She started losing weight and falling more the past few months.  I knew eventually she would sustain an injury from a fall, and well, here we are.  She has lived at her facility for six years and I could not ask for better care or kinder staff.  Hospice has also been useful. She already had a hospital bed and now has an alternating air pressure mattress thingy.  She is on morphine for the pain, as well as Tylenol with codeine and/or ibuprofen. We have discontinued most of her other meds; there are a couple that we are tapering down.  Her wonderful, amazing, superb neurologist has had to discharge her from his care, but made it clear I am to call him anytime for advice or just to talk.   She is eating (being fed, which is another story), and drinking.  We placed a Foley catheter as she suddenly became unable to void her bladder, which apparently can cause a lot of discomfort and distress.  A catheter comes with risks and is invasive, but I felt it was more important to relieve her discomfort.  I have now gone from seeing her in person only once since March 7, 2020, to seeing her nearly every day.  The facility had just opened up for scheduled half hour visits on a limited basis, but immediately allowed me into the building (with no restrictions on length of visit, bless them) and I now have special dispensation to visit any time day or night, as often as I wish, for as long as I wish, and can even stay there if I want to.  So, not actively dying, but suddenly so much closer.  The pamphlets and such that hospice have provided me are incredibly vague and insultingly devoid of actual medical information. I have not wanted to fall down an Internet black hole, so please, can anyone point me towards some specific and medical information about not just actively dying and actual end-of-life, but whatever it is you call what she’s doing now? Any assistance would be gratefully appreciated.  Thank you all for listening.  (Also, please feel free to ask questions or for clarification.  I’m exhausted and my brain is a sieve so I have no doubt left out important information-inadvertently, I assure you!)",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/56544/after-the-fall-1,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-04-26 20:15:43,552370,112.0

No diagnosis (didn't expect one), but she is super mad at me for forcing the issue.  When I try to acknowledge her feelings of frustration, she switches gears and says, ""let's not fight."" Passive aggressive behavior makes me crazy, so it's grinding away at me even though I know it's a symptom of a breaking-down brain. Follow-up testing with the neurologist is scheduled, and we were told there would be a delay.  I was not expecting a 10-MONTH delay, though...she is confidently expected to be able to complete testing NEXT MAY.  Mom's house is in contract to sell, and closes in 2 weeks. Title company sent her a bunch of online login stuff for setting up wire transfers and paying off loans. I have POA (thank goodness) so I can get it all untangled, but it's a pain and frustrating...wish it would just have been set up for me to handle in the first place. Also, for the home that's selling, my brother's son is supposed to be mowing the lawn. This is the second time in two weeks that the agent has called to ask about mowing the property. I'm 2 states away and can't do it, and my brother PROMISED it would be done last week. So now I'm frustrated about that, too. I am trying to take care of Mom's bills, and I expect things to be a little more complex/a little more of a mess during this transition. However, she is taking everything that is set up to be paid via online bill pay, and turning it into paper payments with her checkbook.

We decided that she needed to go to the hospital to make sure she didn't have a serious injury but we couldn't get her to walk so we called an ambulance. The ED determined that she did not have any broken bones, just a lot of soft tissue damage and they told her to take Ibuprofen and rest and to use a walker when she needed to get around. Of course, once we got back home, MIL seemed unable to walk and kept complaining about the pain, but left alone in her room she was on the phone chatting and texting and watching TV like nothing was wrong. Once one of us went in her room she'd grab her leg and start moaning & complaining and crying that the pain was so bad....she was honestly like a small child seeking attention. This morning she complained to DH that her leg isn't any better today even after staying off of it for a night, yet now that he's at work I can hear her getting around upstairs and not a peep about pain. I'm sure if I went upstairs though I'd get an earful. How do I handle this without going off on her and accusing her of acting like a child?  Both DH and I are at the end of our patience with her behavior.

I don't have the heart to withhold food and water. So i suppose the few spoonfuls she gets every day is what is sustaining her? She gets haldol regularly thru the day. We have morphine but I don't give it to her regularly because she doesn't appear to be in pain. For the most part she is resting comfortably. She doesn't like to be turned or changed so she gets morphine before her bed baths. I don't like the effect morphine has on her. I don't like the way she looks when she has taken morphine. She already looks dead. If that makes sense. Maybe I just have to get over that and push the morphine to make the end come sooner?

1788,647b5dfa091b6ef899d207d1,57392,,The risks of an assisted-living facility with memory care - Should I be worried?,"Hello. Let me start with some background information about my mother. She is 81 years old. Three years ago, my mother began having hallucinations. She started seeing deceased family members in our home. First, my father. Then, her parents. Then, her sister. As these hallucinations went on over the years, I reported them to her primary doctor. But he dismissed them as anxiety or depression. In March 2021, she had a mental episode and was hospitalized for an evaluation. A CT scan showed ischemia and microvascular irregularities. This CT scan and her hallucinations led doctors to conclude that she had probable vascular dementia. In early April 2021, she went into a nursing home. That home was getting her ready to be discharged to an assisted-living facility with memory care. In early May, she was taken to a hospital because of pain. The hospital discovered that she had fallen down and had broken her hip, and she underwent hip-repair surgery with general anesthesia. The hip was repaired successfully. Unfortunately, the general anesthesia seemed to worsen her dementia. She developed severe behavioral issues, and she became incontinent. After she recovered from the hip surgery and her behavioral issues improved, she was released back to the nursing home in early June 2021. But she remained incontinent. The nursing home continued to get her ready to be discharged to an assisted-living facility with memory care.   Well, about 2 weeks ago, the nursing home declared that my mother was ready to be discharged to an assisted-living facility with memory care. A certain assisted-living facility assessed my mother and came to the conclusion that she would be a good fit for the facility. I toured the facility and decided that the facility would be good for her. Now, it's time to fill out the paperwork.   In the paperwork, there is a sheet of paper that supposedly describes the risks of assisted-living facilities with memory care.  Before my mother can move into this facility, I have to sign a different sheet of paper acknowledging that I understand these risks. I have attached the sheet that describes these risks.   The sheet describing the risks states that, if a resident has sustained a fall prior to moving into our facility, it is likely that he/she will fall again at some point. Well, during my mother's stay at the nursing home, she has fallen three times. The second fall resulted in a broken hip and surgery.   This assisted-living facility does have motion detectors in every private room. And, every time there is motion in a private room, the staff members check in on the patient to make sure that the patient does not fall. Even my mother's current nursing home does not have such motion detectors.   Also, the sheet describing the risks states that there is a risk of residents wandering from the facility's premises. Wait a second! This is supposed to be a locked memory-care facility where the residents can not get out. I understand that the residents can wander from their rooms and through the halls, but they can also wander away from the entire facility?   And then there is the stuff about skin breakdown. I am assuming that ""skin breakdown"" means something like bed sores.   So, what's going on here? Do these risks exist in every assisted-living facility with memory care? Would every facility give me such a paper describing risks? Or is this particular facility simply trying to cover itself legally for providing substandard service?   Any help would be appreciated.",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/57392/the-risks-of-an-assisted-living-facility-with-memory-care-should-i-be-worried,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-07-09 22:06:29,767112,8.0

1801,647b5eb7091b6ef899d21121,56010,,Free at last - Update,"Life really does go on. More than two years later. See comments at the very end. There were many comments when posted in 2019. Posted: Monday, February 11, 2019 10:29 PM Sue is finally FREE. She passed away peacefully during the night. Alzheimer’s might have won in the end but I choose to remember the beautiful, caring, and compassionate person she always has always been.  I posted this several years ago and a final update:  2012 - Only the lonely can understand the heartache of divorce or having a loving spouse afflicted with Alzheimer’s.  Like divorce, I feel the same emotions of not being able to accept the fact “why did she leave me and why doesn’t she love my anymore?”  She may be here physically but she is not the same person that I not only married 39 years ago but loved for all those many years.  She has lost her friendly smile, sense of humor, caring attitude and love of life.  Most of her memories are already gone.  I visit her daily at the Living Center and feel guilty as many memories are also beginning to fade. This is definitely not what I expected of our “Golden Years”.  She took care of me and our daughter for oh so many years so I certainly didn’t mind being her Caregiver.  Luckily I was retired and able to cook, clean and care for her 24/7 for over 5 years after her diagnosis of having Alzheimer’s.  Not until I was unable to properly care for her did I make the bittersweet decision to move her into a Nursing Home.  That was without a doubt the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.  War is hell.  I spent two years in Viet Nam but it was not as difficult as having to physically separate myself from the loved one with whom I had given my all.  She was never coming back.  She was staying there in that unfamiliar place, alone.  Since that day we will never be the same. I miss her loving touch, her smile, just being in the same room and not saying anything.  Her mere presence made me complete.  Slowly, oh so slowly she left me and there was nothing either of us could do to prevent it.  She is slowly mentally reversing the aging process. Not that long ago she was no longer able to differentiate the days of the week, tell the time of day and is slowly losing her ability to communicate. She even wears a diaper, actually Depends.  It pains me deeply when I see her pick up a doll and play with it like a child.  I was alright for a while but now she’s gone, gone but never forgotten. I am unhappy not because she is out of sight but is out of mind.  I am content knowing that I made her smile, made her life complete and that makes my life worthwhile.  I realize that in her excellent physical condition that she could live many more years and easily outlive me. I was content being a Caregiver.  I enjoyed taking care of her needs but now that she is in a Nursing Home I feel not-needed, empty and alone. There has to be more to life than this. Not only did I lose my life mate and my true love, but most important I lost my best friend.  Friends minister to each other, nurse each other, worry about each other, and stand always ready to help.  Perfect friendship is rarely achieved but that we did. The Definition of Love – “A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance”.  Love requires two loving and caring people. Unfortunately that is no longer possible.  It is difficult to comprehend how hard it is to cope with her blank stares, knowing that there isn’t any recognition of whom she is staring at.  2013 - Two years have now passed since arriving at the Secure Care Facility.  She is now unable to speak or even recognize me, family or friends.  She is still able to walk but requires assistance to eat.  She is considered to be in stage 7 of A.D. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2005 and I was able to keep her at home until 2011. 2015 – She in now non ambulatory and unable to walk, stand or even move her hands or feet. Seldom addressed are the needs of the Caregiver, especially after the Alzheimer’s patient is within the confines of a nursing home.  I will do anything possible for her and plan to continue to see her daily as long as we both live but cannot say for sure that I honestly love her in the true meaning of the word.  Does this make me a bad person or a realist?  I was gratified traveling through life with someone I cared for and who cared for me, it made our lives complete.  It is difficult to continue without the shared affection and compassion of a caring individual.  The friendship of friends and relatives just isn’t the same.  I have learned to deal with the stress but it is difficult to cope with the loneliness. I can still remember when I visited my wife daily. Don’t do that anymore but I do visit an old friend (Her) every day. Well I have missed seeing/visiting her only 7 days in eight years. It is now 2019 and she has left the building, to return nevermore. I pray for those of you that may have a similar future in store for you. Good luck and God bless! It is now 2021.YES, it is now two years later and a LOT of water has passed under the bridge. Both good and bad. Within two weeks of Sue's passing i was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Yes, these are our ""Golden Years"". While she was in the nursing home i started a monthly Nursing Home Family Council and was very active in the Alzheimer's Support group. Through the group I met someone that also had a spouse with Alzheimer's. He passed and I didn't see her for over two years until a unexpected meeting. We went to lunch monthly until my wife's passing. She previously had cancer also and became my Guardian Angel, significant other and the love of my life. Without her I certainly wouldn't be here today. You have no idea what a positive attitude, faith and demanding an unparalleled quality of life can do for you. I have endured Chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy and surgery. I even lost my voice and Doctors said it wouldn't return, they were wrong about that too, luckily. We went on a wonderful 7 day cruise with my daughter and husband. Total less than having a great quality of life was probably 6 months. I still walk about 2 miles daily over 50% of the time. I feel great and without any pain. We have also beat covid19 with flying colors with only minor side effects. Again having some issues so started Chemo again. We'll see how that works but with my attitude and faith we expect good results. Don't ever give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel if only you look for it. You do need someone special to help you. If that person is not there now then find that person. He/She needs you as much as you need them.

I love mom and don't want this to be, but now, it is what it is. So, mom's diagnosis 2 years ago was simply ""dementia"". I've been doing what I can to help her, despite the fact that I'm physically and mentally disabled. It is so difficult for me, and I'm stressed out so terrible that sometimes I don't know how much longer I can deal with mom, til I finally have enough and spontaneous combust. But I have a feeling if I did, it would be my last, because as of this moment, I don't think I can keep going. I'm so tired and exhausted.  Not to mention that I discovered I'm experiencing a sort of Spiritual Awakening, and that's stressful enough, because now, I feel that karma is out of order for other people, yet in full working order for me. I want to have time for myself but it seems impossible. Mom also acts as if my very presence bothers her. She's EXTREMELY aggressive without her zoloft. She's off meds for dementia because aricept caused too bad of diarrhea, the other (mem...?) caused this recent hallucination. So now mom's had her 2nd hallucination that I'm aware of. I want to spend more time with her, but she is very impatient and bitterly hateful, and all she does is watch Netflix. (I'm a YT guy, not exactly Netflix unless I must). she does do laundry, but it's not very good... she leaves wet clothes in dryer without turning it on, I find them the next day. She also puts too much in at a time to wash, and tons of other things. Brother claims he'll help, and to call if i need him, but when I do, he takes it allout of context and gets mad at me for god-knows-what. I really need help and support through this, and I have no one to help.  I need cervical spine surgery, it's very important to get it done, but I've put it off because it would be done out of town, and I don't want to stress her with helping me, though really it's high priority to get that surgery done, because I have 2 more after that - knee, which I've had surgery on both already, but they said there's degenerative changes in it.

Pet Scan/CT/MRI findings: Alzheimer’s dementia and/or Parkinsonian dementia with Vascular Dementia as well.  (No evidence of FT or Lewys) My mother does not display typical Alzheimer’s traits.  She is still mobile but has no ADLs and  she can still feed herself.  She is still cognitive to an extent.  She mostly understands what you’re asking her, and can answer back sometimes. .  BUT she “babbles” (word salad) every waking moment, - it never stops.  This constant babble started in December and has progressed rapidly.  She was put on Seroquel in October, with no other meds.  Since the end of January my mom has been on full hospice at home.  The babble accelerated considerably a week ago, - which prompted a telehealth visit with her Neurologist.  The Seroquel (75mg) works perfectly to put her to sleep at night, but the daytime dosing either makes her sleep or keeps her awake and in the “babble” state.  We played with the dosing - no luck.  So the Neurologist prescribed 2 depekote (sprinkles) for day and keep the 75mg Seroquel for night.  Xanax as needed.   She has had no quieting effect with either the depekote or Xanax. I suspect a possible UTI, but she has no fever and is not complaining about any pain.  I’m hoping to get a sample (near impossible). I also suspect she could be having this amped up babble “mania” as a side effect from the Seroquel? Has anyone experienced this NON-STOP BABBLE?

There's so much he can't do because he can't walk, and the little he can do, he doesn't seem to enjoy (playing cards, watching tv, games on the iPad).  He has lost his sense of taste and hunger, and the only thing we can get him to eat is vanilla ice cream. He claims everything else tastes bad or he feels like he's full all the time. If he doesn't eat, he doesn't have energy, and then he can't do any of his exercises from the physical therapist. I'm losing hope that he will be able to get to the toliet on his own ever again and he will be in diapers for the rest of his life.  He's currently in a skilled nursing rehab because he stopped eating and drinking totally and ended up dehydrated and experienced delirium/hallucinations. This has happened twice now.

My mother is 92, she has 24/7 care with caring Aides in her home. I take care of all her non-daily needs, and visit her once a week. She has, I'd say, moderate dementia or so. She is very very articulate and verbal in the present, and can have some wonderful conversations with me, but can't remember much of anything that happened a few minute previously.  She also has a broken and displaced hip, and has been unable to stand for close to a year. She goes from her bed to a chair. She only has pain when the leg/hip is moved, and is pretty comfortable (more or less) when sitting or lying down, still.  BUT she feels the need, pretty much constantly to ""go to the bathroom"" and asks, begs, then cries, constantly. She has been totally incontinent for at least 2 years. She can't remember that her hip is broken, or that holding her up to stand or moving the bad leg at all, causes screaming-intense pain. She thinks she can walk.  And every time (when I'm there) I tell her otherwise, she's shocked, falls into despair, cries, can't bear the news of it, says ""it hurts"" she has to go to the bathroom, she can't go in the diaper, etc..  Eventually (I assume once she unknowingly ""goes in her diaper"") the issue resolves and she is a lovely, engaged, chatty person. I know she has a ""distended bladder"" so perhaps the need is real. I also know it disappears at times, as suddenly as it appears. A distraction can sometimes end the terrible need/pain/crying etc... But it can go on ""i have to go"" followed by crying, for hours.. She is homebound, clearly. It is basically impossible to get her a doctor. In the past when she was still going in a wheelchair (impossible now, it's excruciating for her), she would screech  ""get me out of here!!!"" ""they're killing me"" and so on. So it isn't easy. I talk to her doctors regularly. I cannot find one in the area to come to her home. She is a DNR.

She can move her arms, and that's about it.  I am looking for a way, if possible, to deal with the intense need to get up to go to the bathroom. It can go on for hours. It can start at 3:30AM, etc.. Might there be a medication to calm those urges? Without side effects? I know there is the risk of a UTI, but she has been like this for months and months. And how would anyone even get a urine sample? I just want her to be comfortable and suffer less. When she's NOT yelling ""take me to the bathroom, I can walk, I walked yesterday, take me!!!"" she is content, happy to be alive, enjoys her meals, her view out the window, looking at her photos, and etc.  Any thoughts re: how to deal with this? I will talk to her doctor, of course, but curious about personal experience.  Thank you!",False,,,,https://alzconnected.org/discussion/56595/need-to-go-to-the-bathroom-but-cant-walk-problem,,,AlzConnected-v2,2021-04-30 20:53:39,685653,3.0
1811,647b5f2a091b6ef899d216c8,56175,,End of life preparation,"My husband died 16 years ago. He has 2 brothers that live in Florida (we r in WV). So Since that time I have cared for their mother. I have known for at least 10yrs something wasn’t right. She gave away at least $30,000 to some scam in Jamaica. I finally had her diagnosed about 5 yrs ago. She lived next door. I fed, cleaned house, did laundry and such for her until about 2 years ago when doctors insisted she couldn’t live alone anymore. Her sons told me about 5 yrs ago they would come get her and take to Florida. When I felt like I couldn’t do it alone anymore...I called and asked if they found a place for her. Neither son was willing to take her in since they couldn’t get assistance unless she lived in that state for a year.  But I have managed alone.  She tried to crawl out of bed and fell and hit her head on bed rail. When she got out of hospital they ordered hospice for her. She came home a different person. 2nd day she hit me on bridge of nose and blacked both my eyes. She has since been fighting me on everything. I carry scratch and bruises on me constantly. I didn’t know because of neuropathy and diabetes..she was in pain and it hurt when I touched or moved her around in bed to prevent bed sores. A week ago she had mini stroke. Now they have her on morphine, Ativan and something they put behind her ear. She is not as violent now. But it is really hard to change her or pull her up in the bed.  I love this woman just as I did my own mother. We have been friends for over 40 years. I have no regret for giving up my life to care for her alone. But now she won’t eat or drink and I am watching her fade more each day. How do u do that??? I get zero financial from her kids even though they took 23,000 out of savings account. No moral support..nothing. One son calls every week or 2 and thanks me for what I do for her. The other son does gods to call every 2 or 3 months to check on her. So how do people do this alone??? I can’t afford to pay someone to help me. I have a girl that comes in 3 hours a week so I can get groceries and go to doctor appointments. I have had heart and lung surgery. Have COPD, asthma, thyroid issues and am bipolar and still struggle with PTSD. I feel exhausted and just a shell of a person. I spend hours in front of tv when nothing is there. I tried to get her in nursing home right b4 she fell. But no one wants to take Alzheimer’s patients after they have been placed with hospice. At this point I am just trying to be there for her so she won’t be scared or alone. I sit by her bed begging pleading crying trying to get her to take a drink or just a couple of bites of food. But am not being very successful. I thought taking care of my parents was hard (they have both passed) but caring for Alzheimer’s is whole different set of worries and stress. They say she has marbling on hands and feet. They say I should get myself prepared for this end of life stage. She is transitioning. I have read a lot but nothing prepares u for this. How can someone prepare for this??? I was comfortable taking care of her b4. But now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing. Well I have vented enough. God bless u all! Have a blessed day!

1812,647b5f36091b6ef899d2175a,56236,,Very near death - need to talk to someone experienced!," Our LO is very near death. I’m just feeling so many things right now and want to share with someone who may understand. I want to share here what we are experiencing right now: if anyone in this group has a LO who has died, can you give me any insight to these developments and to what stage we may be in in the dying process? I know everyone is different and there is no estimate of a persons time left on earth - but I’m wondering if I have days, weeks, or possibly months left of this agony of watching  someone to die  -  it’s horrible, truly horrible. Warning, this post is a little graphic concerning her physical decline. We have hospice here at home and the nurse said she believes our LO is transitioning into ‘active dying’ but is not there yet. Our LO is unresponsive, unable to speak, sleeps constantly (like in a coma). She has an extreme amount of sleep in her eyes. I would say every 2-3 hours I wipe out her eyes and they are FULL of goop. Her eyeballs are filmed over, a really thick gel looking film.  She isn’t eating or drinking for the past few days: she’s had a few syringes of clear Ensure juice, and barely got it down - can’t swallow. Shes on liquid morphine: if we touch her body at all she winces in pain.  She has a catheter and her pee is the color of coke. Her earlobes are flattened tight against her head, and she has splotchy red all over her legs. I’ve read those are signs of impending death, has anyone heard of or seen that before? She does not move at all, she is breathing pretty regular but it’s slow, long pauses between breaths.  Does this sound like the end to anyone here who is experienced?? Our nurse is a bit overly optimistic I feel like, she’s very reassuring and kind but I feel like she’s a bit tight lipped regarding death. I think she doesn’t want to say “she’s dying now” or “she won’t die for a while” to protect us in a way.  I feel like we are just sitting here waiting for her to die. It’s a terrible feeling.  Can anyone give me some insight into the dying process? What happened in your experience, does it get severely worse than this? Do I need to mentally prepare for worse things?  Thanks for reading this.

1815,647b5f84091b6ef899d21b39,57127,,Doctor visit today- ever feel like it’s pointless?,"I took my Mom to a doctor visit that she asked for today. Dad had one too for a followup on his pneumonia.  Now, mind you, Mom  wanted this doctor visit when Dad had his last one but I couldn’t  get her in. As late as Sunday, she was still desperately wanting this doctor visit due  to various aches and pains, and oh yeah, she was losing her mind.  I figured out the patient portal stuff and wrote  the doctor a long message about her recent behavior and that I thought she was  getting worse. I also asked for some resources as I felt I was sinking and not up to this task. He wrote back this morning that maybe she needed a neurologist referral, so I wrote back ok let’s do that.  He said he’d give me some resource info.  Her appointment was at 1pm.  I had given her and dad instructions to eat something in their apartment before hand because they would miss the dining hall lunch hour. The entire 50 minute drive was spent answering the same few questions from my Mom: why am I going to the  doctor, I don’t want to go, it’s a waste of time, I feel like I am losing my  mind,  why is (her spouse) going to the doctor then the wheel would spin and we would start over.  She cried multiple times in her half hour doctor visit. first she would say she wasn’t in pain, then she would admit to a little pain, and then a lot. So the doctor told her she could have Tylenol( not Aleve) along with the Meloxicam and the Flexeril she already takes.  We went over how many and how often multiple times. Dad didn’t want the Tylenol ordered thru the pharmacy for the nurse to administer, so he promised to help keep track of what she took. He hates that the staff at the ASL manage their prescribed medication even though neither of them can.  The doctor discussed  her mood and her mind, didn’t change any medications and didn’t mention the neurologist referral.  He ordered lab work for both of them and the lab is there in the building. So we get that done.  We walk out the door and she asked Dad if she has to ask him for the Tylenol and he said yes.  Which is not what the doctor said.  The first 15 minutes of the drive home was like having two children in the car arguing. She didn’t want to have to ask him, what if he was mad and wouldn’t give her any, we were taking all her Freedoms( a exact quote).  Dad in turn was yelling back at her and was quite proud of himself that he was ‘ in charge ‘ of the Tylenol.  He doesn’t have dementia, he is just not a nice person. Then they pouted.  Mom even did the thing where she turned in her seat in the front and looked at him in the back. I was expecting her to stick her tongue out at him.  It was now 3:00 and she told  me she didn’t eat lunch and she had a headache!  The ‘resource’  I got from the doctor: A two page write up on dementia and a link to alz.Org page.  Sometimes doing to the doctor is a waste of my time.

Sis is really worried that Mom is in bed too much. Mom has been having physical therapy, but hasn't been doing any exercises in between. So all that the physical therapy seems to be doing to making her tired, we've seen no benefit!
