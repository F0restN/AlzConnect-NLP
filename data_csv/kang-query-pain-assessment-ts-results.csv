So the mtg was today.  Part of me wishes I had called her to question why she wanted the mtg because I thought mom was doing pretty good!!! and wasn't seeing much of an issue nor were any of the nurses who I check with all the time including aides restorative therapy etc.. But out of courtesy to her I thought I would go ahead with the mtg and see what she had to say.      It was awkward. I felt on the spot because the dr put forth her concerns that she wanted to treat mom's pain which she thought was getting worse but there had been ""roadblocks"" in the past ( me limiting the amount of vicodin she got daily during bad back pain issue last winter) and she wanted to see what we could come up with to address this.  The mtg also included the Nursing home administrator( new) the DON ( SW was sick) the activities director and mom's nurse who joined halfway in and I wasn't expecting any of them except the SW and dr so it was a surprise.       So though I was uncomfortable I tried very hard to not negate the dr's point of view but how I thought mom was actually doing better since the back pain issue and yes there was a little bit more pain perhaps when I would prod her. I also shared my past experiences with mom and her pain  and horrible reactions to pain meds ( she knew a little bit about it) and that I learned from an old physical therapist to assess mom's pain by her actions and facial expressions AND if she volunteers it without me asking.  I also mentioned that her new physical therapist had told me she thought mom was having more pain because she wasn't walking as much and her muscles were getting tight.  By the way mom is still with it enough to tell me if something is bothering her so when she hurts bad enough you know and that's when I try to get more involved with it.      Though I said all of the above I think everything shifted when mom's nurse came into the room and shared his impressions. He said he thought she was pretty comfortable and improved since the back issue!!!!  And he also said you had to kind of prod her to find out about her pain. So yes I do think mom probably puts up with a certain amount but it in no way seems to affect her ADL's and she still participates fully in all the activities and eats well!       Once he spoke the dr shifted directions and started inquiring about more physical therapy or doing a pain assessment which I'm much more comfortable with. We also talked about increasing her walking a bit more. The DON seemed pretty responsive to all of that.  I also mentioned that we were trying lavender oil based on what a massage therapist had used and dr was okay with that.      Dr did ask me how I felt if mom's pain got worse and I said I would try to be more flexible and open to stronger meds.  ( back story- I spent two years  on and off in hell trying to unravel a multitude of medication issues with my mom in her old nursing home some were pain meds and it was difficult to figure out what the problem was. She had several psych hospitalizations and we were even discussing hospice at one point because she was in such a bizarre mental state refusigng care hitting biting not eating etc. )       Anyways even though we came to a solution I am comfortable with I'm still really bothered that the doctor seemed out of touch and hadn't checked with other staff. I can deal with that she might not want to  call me and ask my impressions but to not even ask the nurse when you are there at the facility? HUH? Just feeling a bit uneasy with the dr at this point and her judgement.       The other issue is that she only comes to see mom every other month as she is part time and the other visit is by a nurse practitioner one of two. In fact mom's issues have sometimes been handled by the doctor's partner and I worry about a lack of continuity as it seems like there has been 3 or 4 people involved and I'm not sure everything is getting through to her doctor. Or that the dr isn't as involved as she would be were she full time. And.....this is the practice the SW recommended I use as the other main affiliated practise wasn't great at returning calls and SW didn't think they were as responsive as these folks. SIGH     So- are they all like this? Could I expect a more tuned in doc or is this the norm? They come in ask the patient a few questions and take off without asking the nurses etc and god forbid the POA?  I'd really like to know. Right now I feel like finding another doc.   There are a few other things that have happened with the doc or one of the other partners that have bothered me and I'm just starting to question if this is the best fit.  I know I need to calm down but I would really LOVE to hear from some of you about your own experiences. Can I expect better than this or should I learn to adjust and try to improve my ability to communicate with this doctor? Sorry this is so long.. wish I could just talk to you all face to face.....",False,LDDaughter,2011-12-22,1065,https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147499818,,,AlzConnected
